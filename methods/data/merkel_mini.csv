1894,2386102761.xml,"Deborah Feldman left her ultra-Orthodox Jewish community for a new life in Berlin. She talked about what it has been like having her autobiography adapted for Netflix.The writer Deborah Feldman's pantry was already stocked for the apocalypse. That's how her Hasidic Holocaust survivor grandparents raised her. They ""believed in the end of the world, had seen the end of the world and always prepared me to live through the end of the world,"" she said by telephone from her Berlin apartment. The day before, Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germans to self-isolate in hopes of slowing the spread of coronavirus. And while many were out panic shopping, she hadn't been to the market once.""I feel like I've been waiting my whole life for corona,"" she said.Anyone who's read Feldman's best-selling 2012 memoir, ""Unorthodox"" -- now the basis of a four-part Netflix series, which debuted last week -- is likely to understand. The book is a stirring account of her struggles with and ultimate rejection of her Satmar community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn -- an insular society of ultra-Orthodox Jews that rose in New York from the ashes of World War II. Culturally conservative and religiously strict, its members believe that their piety and refusal to assimilate will shield them from a repeat cataclysm.The new Netflix series, also called ""Unorthodox,"" was created by Anna Winger (""Deutschland 83"" and ""Deutschland 86"") and Alexa Karolinski (""Oma and Bella""). In their version, much of which is in Feldman's native Yiddish, we see a young woman, Esther Shapiro (Shira Haas), flee an arranged marriage that sours as she struggles to consummate the relationship and produce a baby. Esty heads to Berlin with little more than a passport and some cash, and she makes fast friends with a cohort of student musicians from around the world.Back in Brooklyn, Esty's family erupts in disbelief when they hear she is in Germany, of all places. They enact a plan to send her husband (Amit Rahav) and his mercurial cousin (Jeff Wilbusch) to track her down and force her return.Feldman talked about seeing her story come to life and what it's like to envy your on-screen counterpart. These are edited excerpts from conversations in Berlin and by phone.The TV series is not an exact portrayal of your life, but it still hews to the original plot lines of the book, namely during the Brooklyn flashbacks. Given how personal the story is, was it unnerving for you to see it onscreen?The last two episodes were very hard for me. I thought I was prepared. I had experienced, written and talked about it for years, but these were other people -- not me -- interpreting it, putting it into images, playing the parts, and cutting the scenes. For the first time, I was able to see how others would interpret, or receive, the experience, based on the images fed back to me. It's kind of like if you talked to a therapist for years, and at the end of it all, she presented a book with all your experiences. You'd read them and struggle to recognize them because they've been given back to you from a foreign perspective.You had no formal role in the making of the TV show, but were you tapped for your insights?We had a lot of discussions about when can you sacrifice accuracy and when not. We agreed you can sacrifice accuracy as long as it doesn't impact the narrative. And so we could not get real shtreimels [a fur hat worn by many Satmar men] because the real ones are made of mink; they're expensive, shops wouldn't have sold it to us, and we just didn't have the budget. I was constantly in touch with the costume designer to make fake ones that look real.Making them look real was really hard, and at some point we thought, they're never going to look 100 percent like the real thing. But the only people who are going to know that are going to be Hasidic Jews. And guess what? It doesn't change the story if the shtreimels are fake.What were you homing in on while watching the TV adaptation?I was concerned about the dignity of Esty, which is also one of the things I was concerned about when writing ""Unorthodox""; how do you write about the things that are most shameful and painful in a way that retains dignity? I was worried how Shira would manage to juggle the experience of humiliation and the kind of shattering of all hope while still maintaining some sense of dignity as a woman and human being. I was so scared for her the whole time as I watched the episodes. I felt really anxious because I knew that if she failed, then it would be like I had failed, like I would not have dignity anymore in my story. It's scary to give someone your story for the screen because you can't control it. On the other hand, I knew I didn't want a part in controlling it.In Episode 4, during the Passover scene, the grandfather leads the prayers and tells the story of Exodus. No women participate. Yet, if you look at the actions that move ""Unorthodox"" forward, almost all are taken by the female characters.Men tell the story and women make the story real. Women make the story happen. You have the table where the man dictates prayer, belief and narrative, but if you look at the story of Esty, it's women who are making the decisions. It's the women she's interacting with, who are basically the driving force behind community life, the engine behind the story. If you watch the series with this in mind, you realize that the men are actually kind of passive figures carried along by the story. They play the roles in how it's been told, but it's the women who make the story go on.And do you feel that's how things are in the Williamsburg community where you were raised?I remember being surprised when I went to Sarah Lawrence, and I took a class on feminist philosophy in which everybody told me, ""You left the patriarchy!"" I was like: ""Well, if I left the patriarchy, where were all the men in this patriarchy? Why were they always bent over books while the people who oppressed me were women? Why was it that the people who hurt me the most were my aunt, mother-in-law, female teachers, the female mikvah attendant, the female Kallah teacher and the female sex therapist? Why was it always the women that I felt hurt and betrayed by?"" I had so little interaction with men, and the little I had made me see men as very passive and stuck.When I married my husband, I just remember being so impressed -- in a bad way -- by the fact that he was completely in the grips of his mother. It took him a very long time to free himself from that.How do you thread the needle and tell a story like this one without vilifying an entire culture?In German they have this great saying, ""alle über einen Kamm scheren,"" which is a way of saying ""generalizing about everyone through the prism of one experience."" I think Anna and Alexa were even more concerned and sensitive than I was about this. I'm coming from this world. All I can really tell is my own story and perspective. I'm almost disadvantaged because I have this extremely subjective perspective. But Anna and Alexa have this incredible advantage of not coming from there.And what about you?For me, it was more a question of, ""Oh my God, how am I ever going to tell my story in a way that people will believe and understand me, and it will reach them."" Whereas Anna and Alexa were like, ""How are we going to make the story come across in all of its unique specificity without somehow telling a story about an entire community or tradition?"" I think that the solution to this problem is zooming in and staying zoomed in. When you're watching the series, you don't really meet anyone far beyond Esty's family. The community is there in the background, but it never confronts you. You have a rabbi, but you don't see her in school. You don't see anyone in the synagogue. It's not about explaining the world in which the story takes place. It's just about the story itself.Was there a particular scene that stood out as your favorite?The scene when Esty explodes in the bedroom with her husband, because it's the most powerful. She finally says everything that has been going on in her head. She finally lets loose: It's like a volcano. To me, the series climaxes in this moment. I also felt jealous because I never had a moment like that -- I had many small moments where I tried to express myself, and I tried to speak up for myself, but I love how she just lets it all out. It really touched me, and it made me wish I had been the same way. It made me admire her. I hope that other people will see that scene and want to be like her, too.Top, in ""Unorthodox,"" Shira Haas, in a wedding dress, plays a woman based on Deborah Feldman, above, who fled her Hasidic world in Brooklyn for Berlin.

4063,1869475215.xml,"POTSDAM, Germany -- As the far right rises across Europe, its ascent in Germany has seemed among the most alarming and puzzling.For decades, Germany was thought to be inoculated against far-right politics by its history with Naziism and the Holocaust. But today, Germany is experiencing a resurgence of the right -- driven, at least in part, by its effort to overcome past misdeeds by suppressing any vestige of nationalism.
Since World War II, trying to define the German national identity, much less celebrate it, has been taboo. Doing so was seen as a possible step toward the kind of nationalism that once enabled the Nazi regime. Flags were frowned upon, as was standing for the national anthem.
But spurred by a sense of lost control over the country's borders, economy and politics, many Germans are reaching for a shared identity but finding only an empty space. Into that vacuum slipped the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD, the nation's fastest-growing party with recent polls showing support at 12 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties.
Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.
The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.
The search for identity
The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.
Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.
But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany's ""broken self-confidence.""
A chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany's identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.
""Only in Germany, I found it very strange, people don't want to say 'I am German,' "" she said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD's message she absorbed.
Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, said, ""There has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.""
""It is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,"" he said. ""And this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on 'never again.' ""
For decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.
""Germany has negotiated the European part very well, but the casualty has been Germanness,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who specializes in the legacy of European fascism.
That smoothed the country's path back into the community of nations after World War II. But Germans are increasingly concerned about the costs. A July 2016 Pew poll found that half of Germans had an unfavorable view of the European Union. As Euroskepticism rises, a growing minority of Germans are chafing at what they see as pressure to place European identity before national identity.
The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. ""In Germany, you're not even allowed to say you're proud to be German. You have to say you're European,"" she said. ""So when these people come in, what are they left with?""
The power of challenging a taboo
When people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany's traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.
That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany's far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Björn Höcke, one of the party's fastest-rising figures.
Addressing the crowd, Mr. Höcke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.
Germans are ""the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,"" he said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had ""the mentality of a totally vanquished people,"" he argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.
The crowd's applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.
""The foundation of being able to move forward is identity,"" Mr. Höcke later elaborated in an interview. ""There is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.""
Mr. Höcke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD's national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.
That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian Wälder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.
""The definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it's actually self-destructive,"" Mr. Wälder said. ""Everything will be tolerated except for being a German.""
Focusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people -- punching up against the nation's political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.
That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.
""This will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,"" Professor Fritsche said.
A minority, but influencing the conversation
The AfD, despite its rapid growth, remains a minority party. Its support reached a high of 15 percent according to a survey by Ipsos in late 2016, but slipped to 12 percent in a Feb. 7 poll by the same firm.
But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD's populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging -- raising the possibility that the party's political influence could outpace its electoral gains.
Frauke Petry, the party's national chairwoman, said that the AfD's ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.
Professor Fritsche's research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. ""What would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,"" he said.
There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they ""do not belong to us"" and should be ""forbidden wherever that is legally possible.""
And although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who ""the people"" are was something for all to decide, ""not just a few, no matter how loud they are.""
Mr. Höcke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a ""chancellor-dictator"" who had broken German law by opening the country's borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her ""regime.""
""We Germans have to be self-aware,"" he said in the interview. ""We can see our state falling apart; it's falling apart before our eyes. It's about survival.""

2251,433893537.xml,"      It would not be a G-8 without a microphone mishap.    When leaders of the world's richest nations, the so-called Group of 8, gathered two years ago in St. Petersburg, Russia, President Bush was caught using some blunt, colorful language as he munched a roll during lunch. For four enlightening minutes, the world was treated to an unvarnished view of George W. Bush as he expounded on everything from his penchant for Diet Coke to his long-winded fellow leaders. (""I'm not going to talk too damn long like the rest of them."")   At this week's gathering on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the lunchtime microphones were on again. The life-of-the-party president, mingling before the meal, chatted animatedly about his parents' health, his birthday and the corruption charges facing one of his best buddies in Europe, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.   ""Amigo! Amigo!"" Mr. Bush called out cheerily in Spanish when he spotted the Italian prime minister. ""How you doing, Silvio? Good to see you!"" Later, the president wondered about his former Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. ""Did Putin come to see you since I saw you?"" he asked Mr. Berlusconi. (He had not.)   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany walked in, clutching a newspaper featuring a photograph of  the first  President  Bush during a recent trip to Berlin. ""His father,"" she noted to the other leaders, while President Bush looked concerned. The elder Bush, 84, has been slowing down since his hip replacement surgery last year.    ""How did he feel? How did he look? Can he walk O.K.?"" the president asked.   ""The walking is difficult for him,"" Mrs. Merkel replied.   ""Yeah, I'm worried about him,"" Mr. Bush said.    The talk turned to the president's mother, who had knee replacement surgery last month. ""Two knee operations, two knees at the same time,"" the president said, ""because she didn't want to rehab but once.""   Holding court in the assembled group, Mr. Bush, who turned 62 here on Sunday, remarked that the steep hills of Hokkaido proved a biking challenge. ""So I got on my bicycle this morning,"" he said, ""and got to the bottom of the hill and realized it was really tough to get up. When you're older, as you know. ... ""   Someone asked the president about his birthday; he celebrated on the Fourth of July. ""Big party at the White House, and they had fireworks,"" he said. ""My little girls were there.""   Over in the corner, Mr. Bush spied Robert B. Zoellick, the head of the World Bank. The president's voice boomed, ""Everybody know Zoellick, the World Bank man?""    Then it was back to Mr. Berlusconi. On Tuesday, the day after the lunch, an embarrassed Bush White House issued a formal apology to the Italian prime minister for having distributed a biography to reporters that noted Mr. Berlusconi's ""convictions on a number of corruption charges"" (all overturned) and used the word ""suave"" to describe him. The legal issues came up at the lunch, too.   ""I read the courts are after you again,"" Mr. Bush told Mr. Berlusconi. ""It's unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. Constantly after you.""   Funny, but at the next day's lunch, the microphones were cut off.   Big Words, but for What?   Who writes this stuff, anyway?   Every year the leaders of the Group of 8 -- the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Russia -- meet at some fancy place, like the hot springs resort overlooking Lake Toya near here, to debate matters of international importance. And every year they issue joint communiques overrun with bureaucratic gobbledygook. This year offered some truly mind-numbing prose:    On the global economy: ""We are mindful of the interrelated nature of the issues surrounding the world economy. We remain committed to promoting a smooth adjustment of global imbalances through sound macroeconomic management and structural policies. ...""   On aid to Africa: ""In tackling the development agenda, we will take a multifaceted approach, promoting synergies among M.D.G.-related development sectors. ..."" (M.D.G. refers to eight development goals agreed on after the United Nations Millennium summit meeting in 2000.)    On rising food prices: ""The international community needs a fully coordinated response and a comprehensive strategy to tackle this issue in an integrated fashion. ...""   These communiques, whose true authors remain anonymous, are the products of months of intense negotiations by aides to the leaders -- ""sherpas,"" in Group of 8 lingo. Alden Meyer, a climate change expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists who is here this week, summed up the process this way: ""They're fighting very hard over who gets to say very little.""   Last Wishes   Birthday wishes for Mr. Bush were not the only wishes on the Group of 8 agenda this year.   The host of the meeting, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda of Japan, asked each leader to write personal wishes, to be hung from a bamboo tree as part of a traditional Japanese Tanabata ceremony. Known as the ""star festival,"" it occurs each year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when, according to legend, two stars ordinarily separated by the Milky Way finally meet.   Mr. Bush's wish, typeset rather than in his own hand, had its own starry quality -- a parting missive, perhaps, from a president who will not be there when the Group of 8  meets in Italy next year.   ""I wish for a world free from tyranny: the tyranny of hunger, disease and free from tyrannical governments,"" the president wrote. ""I wish for a world in which the universal desire for liberty is realized. I wish for the advance of new technologies that will improve the human condition and protect our environment. I wish God's blessings on all. George W. Bush.""   President Bush and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia Conferred Tuesday at the Group of 8 Summit Meeting.

610,2112455379.xml,"BERLIN -- A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Germans of Turkish origin not to vote for Chancellor Angela Merkel, branding her governing coalition ""enemies of Turkey.""On Thursday, Mr. Erdogan is arriving in Berlin for a full state visit, complete with military honors, a state banquet and a lunch with Ms. Merkel.
The rapprochement is striking and no coincidence: With Turkey suffering the aftershocks of its worst economic crisis in 15 years, Mr. Erdogan has radically changed tune and toned down his anti-Western rhetoric.
""We want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be,"" he said earlier this week.
For Germany, the aim of this week's state visit in Berlin, officials say, is to normalize prickly relations with an important NATO partner on Europe's southeastern flank. For Turkey, indirectly, one goal is to repair relations with the United States, which imposed sanctions this summer over the continued detention of an American pastor.
But the visit has also underscored that, like him or not, Europe has to deal with Mr. Erdogan and the reality of a budding dictator on its border. Turkey's stability -- both economic and geopolitical -- remains a strategic priority for Germany and Europe.
It is a tough pill, and the realities surrounding the divergent trajectories of the two leaders only make it harder to swallow.
Fifteen years in power already, Mr. Erdogan, his country's economic troubles notwithstanding, is secure since his re-election in June to a newly expanded presidency that has given him sultan-like powers. Ms. Merkel, now in her 13th year as chancellor and increasingly weakened at home and abroad, is considered a lame duck.
Absent a common understanding on democratic necessities, the relationship is increasingly transactional, even as the two nations remain intimately entwined, as Germany is home to about 3 million people with roots in Turkey.
What Mr. Erdogan needs is economic buttressing, and what Ms. Merkel needs is for Turkey to remain economically stable and for the Turkish leader to continue to stem the tide of refugees and migrants that pass through his country from war-torn nations -- be they Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan -- an issue that has become the chancellor's Achilles' heel.
Mr. Erdogan's economy is teetering. The Turkish lira has come under heavy pressure -- losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year -- amid high inflation and spiraling foreign debt. Turkish private sector debt amounts to more than $200 billion, and as the lira has fallen in value Turkish companies have struggled to meet payments.
If he is not quite coming to Germany chastened, with cap in hand, Mr. Erdogan is certainly looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support.
It is a relatively steep climb-down for Mr. Erdogan. Relations with Germany hit rock-bottom last year with weeks of acrimonious sniping, as senior officials on both sides leveled accusations ranging from blackmail and hostage-taking to using Nazi tactics and abetting terrorism. Turkish newspapers branded German foundations and journalists as spies.
Exasperated with Mr. Erdogan's jibes, and detentions of German citizens and threats to a list of its businesses in Turkey, Germany last summer announced a policy change that curtailed European economic assistance to Turkey.
Analysts say the policy has worked, though Turkish officials insist the mood has calmed because German and Turkish elections are now out of the way.
""That's the language that Erdogan understands -- but you have to be willing to speak it,"" said Cem Özdemir, a prominent Turkish-German lawmaker and member of the Green Party who has been a vocal critic both of Mr. Erdogan's authoritarian politics and Germany's longtime caution in countering it.
As prime minister, Mr. Erdogan had visited Germany several times in recent years. But the three-day visit this week is his first full-blown state visit as president.
The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, had extended the invitation after Mr. Erdogan won elections in June, prompting a wave of criticism.
Ms. Merkel will attempt to make the best of it, but she is conspicuously not attending the state dinner, even as the chancellery insists the snub is not a breach of protocol
Several German lawmakers have said they would boycott proceedings by not attending the banquet as well, and by taking part in protests instead.
Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan ""while German citizens sit in Turkish prisons.""
Several protests are planned for Saturday, when Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to open the new central mosque of the Cologne-based Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, or Ditib, one of Germany's largest Islamic organizations. It is financed by the Turkish government and is suspected of disseminating pro-Erdogan propaganda.
The visit comes after a recent confidence building trip by the Turkish finance minister, Berat Albayrak -- Mr. Erdogan's son-in-law and close adviser -- who sent the right messages about fiscal stability, raising interest rates and curbing expenditure.
""Very positive developments may happen soon and that will bring positive outcomes in the economy,"" Cemil Ertem, Mr. Erdogan's chief economic adviser, predicted of the German visits in the daily newspaper Milliyet Tuesday.
Turkish analysts, too, noted that there has been a sudden improvement in German-Turkish relations in the last two months, including the release of Germans imprisoned under Mr. Erdogan's crackdown against political opponents and critics.
Germany's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Adebahr, said another German citizen had been released on Sept. 20, bringing the number of arrested Germans down to five.
Turkey's relations with the United States have worsened over the detention of the American pastor Andrew Brunson and a dozen other Turkish-Americans and consular employees. President Trump announced sanctions against Turkey early this summer, precipitating the plunge of the lira.
Though it has taken its own tough line against Turkey, Germany voiced support for Ankara, in part fearful of the effects of a teetering Turkish economy on Europe.
Still, ""Germany will not and cannot bail out Turkey,"" said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization.
There is little chance of reinvigorating Turkey's accession process to European Union membership. That demands unanimity among European Union members and Turkey's backsliding on democratic standards has gone too far for European leaders to overlook it, he said.
But Germany can offer political support at a critical time. ""Turkey seeks German support in fixing its relationship with the United States and fixing its economy,"" Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.
Both sides also have an interest in continuing, or reinforcing, an agreement under which Turkey has curbed the flow of refugees through Turkey into Europe. The arrival of more than one million migrants into Germany since 2015 continues to reverberate politically.
Despite its differences with Turkey, Germany has no interest in seeing the Turkish economy slide. German companies have also suffered from the downturn in the Turkish economy and the fall of the lira.
""We have no interest in the situation in Turkey escalating,"" said Mr. Özdemir, the Turkish-German lawmaker, who is attending the banquet with Mr. Erdogan, who, as he put it, would have to ""suffer him.""
""You can't always choose your guests,"" he said. ""The Erdogans and Putins and Trumps of this world are a reality and we have to talk to them.""
""But it's important that we get more out of this visit than nice pictures,"" he said. ""Erdogan wants money. We need to be clear what we want: democracy, human rights, press freedom and no interference into the German-Turkish community in Germany.""

1753,894568485.xml,"      FRANKFURT -- Europe took another step Wednesday toward approval of a broader bailout fund for overly indebted countries after Finland's Parliament agreed to contribute its share despite an unresolved dispute over its demand for collateral from Greece.    The vote, which was 103 to 66, with 30 legislators absent, still leaves seven countries that have not yet ratified the bailout fund. Even after it is approved, the fund, despite expanded resources and power, is considered much too small to fend off further market attacks on Greece and other indebted countries.    The laborious approval process, which can be held up by objections from any one of the 17 countries in the euro zone, has highlighted deep flaws in the bloc's decision-making. Every initiative must traverse an obstacle course, and each hurdle can jostle financial markets anew.    On Wednesday, the top stock market indexes in Europe fell after three consecutive sessions of gains.    Though Finland can now be checked off the list, the next holdout may prove to be Slovakia, where there was talk that a vote on the bailout fund might be delayed until late October, past the unofficial midmonth deadline set by Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. Many Slovakians resent having to help bail out Greece, which, despite its problems, is wealthier.    Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, warned Wednesday that countries in the euro zone must move toward greater unity for the alliance to survive.    ""We are today faced with the greatest challenge our union has known in all its history,"" Mr. Barroso said in his annual State of the Union address at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. ""If we don't move forward with more integration, we will suffer more fragmentation. This will be a baptism of fire for a whole generation.""    Leaders in Germany and elsewhere played down speculation that they were working on bolder responses to the crisis, like a mechanism that would multiply the borrowing power of the bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Officials said they were preoccupied with gaining parliamentary approval for existing measures.    But the euro zone countries face intense pressure from the United States, China and other countries to more forcefully address the sovereign debt problem before the meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies that begins Nov. 3 in Cannes, France.    ""The euro area has been given an ultimatum to put its crisis once and for all behind its back over the coming six weeks,"" Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, wrote in a note to clients.    In an initial effort to impose more spending discipline on euro zone members and to prevent future crises, members of the European Parliament voted Wednesday in favor of rules that would impose fines on countries that broke budget and deficit rules.    Members of the euro zone are supposed to hold their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product, and total debt below 60 percent of G.D.P., but few do.    Under the new rules, countries that exceed those limits will be pressed to make a cash deposit -- in an account that pays no interest -- equal to 0.2 percent of G.D.P. If they still fail to rein in spending, they will forfeit the deposit.    While finance ministers would still need to agree to punish countries, the voting system has been adjusted to make it significantly more difficult to block sanctions.    In addition, national budget plans will come under greater scrutiny, and there will be an alert system to try to detect looming problems like the housing bubbles that helped create the debt crises in Spain and Ireland.    The German Parliament is scheduled to vote Thursday on the bailout fund, in what is seen as a crucial test for Chancellor Angela Merkel.    Austria is scheduled to vote Friday. Still to vote are Cyprus, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovakia.    There were indications that Slovakia's Parliament might not vote until Oct. 25, although Beata Skyvova, a spokeswoman for the Slovak Parliament, said that one party in the governing coalition was pressing for an earlier vote and that more negotiations would take place before a final date was decided.    That would be about three months after euro zone representatives agreed to give the rescue fund more money and power. The expanded fund will be able to lend up to 440 billion euros, or about $600 billion, and issue guarantees for 780 billion euros.    Mr. Cailloux said that the fund needed about 2 trillion euros to be effective.    Finland continues to demand that it receive collateral from Greece in return for aid to that country. But Finnish leaders argued that approval for the rescue fund, which will also provide aid to Ireland, Portugal and other countries, was a separate issue.    That reasoning cleared the way for the Finnish Parliament to approve the bill Wednesday.    Finland is still negotiating with its European partners on the collateral issue, and officials in Helsinki have expressed optimism that a solution will be found to address Finnish sensibilities without undermining the aid package.    Meanwhile, Greece moved closer to receiving the next installment of aid it needs to avoid bankruptcy.    Officials from the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank were traveling to Athens to assess whether to recommend release of the aid, said Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, a European Commission spokesman.    During his speech to the European Parliament, Mr. Barroso said that changes needed to secure the euro's future might require reopening the Union's governing treaty. He reiterated that Greece would stay in the euro zone.    Mr. Barroso confirmed that the European Commission, the union's executive branch, would speed up a feasibility study on issuing euro bonds -- common debt that would be guaranteed by all members of the euro zone. He gave his clearest support to the idea yet.    ""Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all,"" he said.    ""We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union,"" Mr. Barroso argued. ""It is an illusion to think we could have a single currency and a single market with national economic approaches.""    Mr. Barroso also announced a proposal for a European tax on financial transactions, a move that Germany and France support strongly but that countries like Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden say they would back only if it were agreed to at a global level. That is unlikely, given opposition from the United States.    Credit: JACK EWING and STEPHEN CASTLE; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

1504,2431408859.xml,"As Biden works to win over progressive voters, he has empowered a Washington uber-veteran long trailed by allegations of personal and financial indiscretion.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. knew how to flatter an old friend.He had been sitting in the Oval Office in May 2014, in his telling, convening privately with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Barack Obama when another commitment demanded his attention: Christopher J. Dodd, the former Connecticut senator turned movie industry lobbyist, was expecting Mr. Biden imminently at a trade conference nearby.The vice president said he bid the chancellor farewell.""Angela Merkel looked at me like, 'What in the hell is he talking about?""' he recounted a short while later -- perhaps with characteristic exaggeration -- talking up Mr. Dodd's clout before his colleagues at the Motion Picture Association of America.The vice president noted the ""rumors,"" dating to their time as legislative peers, that Mr. Dodd ""controlled"" him despite Mr. Biden's Senate seniority.""I've given new life to those rumors,"" he joked.Six years later, Mr. Biden would appear to be doing so again. With the biggest decision of his long campaign life looming -- choosing a running mate before accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in less than two weeks -- he has tasked Mr. Dodd with helping to lead the selection process.The choice is about comfort and trust for Mr. Biden, his friends and allies say: Mr. Dodd, a fellow septuagenarian Irish Catholic from the Northeast, has known Mr. Biden for decades and is intimately familiar with the capital's corridors of power. As a legislator, Mr. Dodd was regarded as canny and effective by bipartisan consensus, traits that could serve him, and the former vice president, well in a role that necessarily entails seeking agreement from disparate groups.Yet his involvement in 2020 has also struck some Democrats as curious, at minimum, from the moment it was announced in April. As Mr. Biden pledges to name a woman to the ticket and works to convince progressive voters that he hears their calls for wide-scale change, he has elevated, in Mr. Dodd, a Washington uber-veteran long trailed by allegations of personal and financial indiscretion.Criticisms of Mr. Dodd, lobbed quietly in some Democratic circles for months, spilled into open view late last month after Politico reported that Mr. Dodd had privately complained about a lack of ""remorse"" from Senator Kamala Harris of California, a top vice-presidential contender, over her attacks on Mr. Biden when she ran for president last year.While former staff members have defended Mr. Dodd as a champion of women and he issued a statement saying the remarks as reported ""do not represent my view on Senator Harris,"" some younger Democratic women have accused him of conveying a retrograde vision of female political ambition. ""The 1980s called,"" tweeted Jess O'Connell, a former top adviser to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, ""and wants Sen. Dodd back.""But then, so did Mr. Biden, a fact as reflective of his political instincts as any vice-presidential pick he might make.In many ways, Mr. Biden, who is often publicly wistful about a bygone era of Senate harmony, has identified in Mr. Dodd a kind of avatar of the Washington he loved, when lawmakers  got along and the chamber retained a sheen of statesmanship. He once called Mr. Dodd his ""single best friend"" in Congress.""You look at Chris, and you think, man, there's a lot of tradition there,"" said Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator from Nebraska who served with both men, nodding at Mr. Dodd's legislative lineage as the son of a senator.""Chris Dodd, John Kerry -- the guys, right?"" Carol Moseley Braun, a former Democratic senator from Illinois, said of Mr. Biden's friend group in his Senate heyday. ""Being the Black girl, I was not part of the old boys' network. I was not part of the circle of friends, and I would never be. That was just the way things are. But they were all nice to me.""In an emailed statement, a Biden campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said the former vice president was ""deeply grateful for Sen. Dodd's friendship and his contributions to the selection process, alongside his incredibly talented colleagues.""But in naming Mr. Dodd one of four selection committee co-chairs, Mr. Biden has also revived examinations of his friend's own checkered résumé.This includes a politically damaging controversy over whether Mr. Dodd received preferential treatment on Countrywide loans. A Senate ethics panel cleared him of serious wrongdoing in 2009 but scolded him for not taking greater care to avoid the appearance of impropriety.There was also a longstanding accusation that Mr. Dodd participated in an episode of sexual misconduct involving a waitress and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his close friend, in the mid-1980s.Tales of Mr. Dodd's womanizing as a then-unmarried senator were so legion that veterans of Capitol Hill at times invoked his name in private last spring after Mr. Biden faced his own accusation of sexual assault.Yes, there were lawmakers who had a reputation for lasciviousness, they allowed. But Mr. Biden was not one of them. He was no Chris Dodd.Expecting loyalty, and returning itWhile Mr. Biden, a teetotaler who famously took the train home to Delaware each night, did not share his friend's social appetites, their dual political arcs seemed to bond them through the years.Both men reached the Capitol in their early 30s -- Mr. Biden as a senator, Mr. Dodd as a congressman until his promotion in 1981 -- growing into caucus eminences and frequent collaborators.And both men joined the historic Democratic presidential primary of 2008, when Mr. Obama outlasted Hillary Clinton for the nomination, and saw their nonhistoric campaigns roundly rejected by voters, a parallel setback that friends say drew them closer.Like Mr. Biden, former aides say, Mr. Dodd valued loyalty as a principal virtue early in his public life, holding close to favored confidantes.""He's one of the rare politicians who not only expects loyalty but returns it,"" said Marla Romash, who worked on Mr. Dodd's first Senate campaign and later served as his press secretary in the 1980s.Ms. Romash was among the women whom Mr. Dodd placed in senior positions in his office and campaigns.""That door opened for me through Chris Dodd,"" said Rosa DeLauro, his former campaign manager and chief of staff who has been a Connecticut congresswoman for nearly three decades.In some corners of the capital, though, Mr. Dodd's personal life could occasionally overshadow his record.He dated Bianca Jagger and amassed prolific bar tabs with Mr. Kennedy, who had a starring role in two prominent accounts of Mr. Dodd's hard-living years.In one, captured in a 2011 book by the actress Carrie Fisher, she described a blind date with Mr. Dodd during a night out with the two senators. ""So, do you think you'll be having sex with Chris at the end of your date?"" Mr. Kennedy asked, according to Ms. Fisher, who recalled Mr. Dodd leering with ""an unusual grin hanging on his very flushed face.""A more serious charge circulated in media reports decades earlier: that Mr. Kennedy had sexually assaulted Carla Gaviglio, a young waitress at a Capitol Hill restaurant, when he was with Mr. Dodd in 1985. Ms. Gaviglio said in a recent interview that Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Dodd had summoned her to a private dining room. When she arrived, she recalled, ""I was thrown across the table and then picked up and thrown on top of Senator Dodd by Senator Kennedy."" Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Gaviglio said, then rubbed his genitals on her.Mr. Dodd did not try to stop Mr. Kennedy during the assault, she said, but she did not consider Mr. Dodd the instigator.A spokesman for Mr. Dodd declined to comment on Ms. Gaviglio's account.Friends say Mr. Dodd's life took a dramatic turn after he remarried in 1999 and became a father. (His first marriage ended shortly after he reached the Senate.) And at no point did his after-hours conduct appear to dent his standing as a reliable Democrat who was well liked by his colleagues.For years, amid an extended stay on the Foreign Relations Committee and legislative victories on children's issues, Mr. Dodd was perhaps best known for working to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, which offered workers unpaid time off to care for a child or sick relative and became law under President Bill Clinton.Seeking the presidency himself in 2008, Mr. Dodd anchored his bid around ending the Iraq war, which he had voted to authorize, and promising financial security to retirees. He offered himself up to Democrats with a less-than-stirring self-description: an ""unknown quantity with experience.""An emissary roleThe electorate did not reward this pitch.And Mr. Dodd and Mr. Biden found themselves at last on divergent professional paths after their twin 2008 campaign failures.Mr. Biden became vice president. Mr. Dodd became a lame duck, though not before co-writing what is now his most cited legislative legacy: the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul of 2010, expanding federal oversight of the financial system.As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Dodd had fought perceptions that he had grown too close to special interests and corporations he was charged with overseeing.The senator's top campaign contributors included major insurance, securities and investment firms, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and the pharmaceutical industry pushed for Mr. Dodd's re-election.But facing the prospect of a difficult race, Mr. Dodd resolved to leave on his terms -- 40 years after seeing his father, Thomas J. Dodd, driven from the Senate after being censured for misappropriating campaign funds.He announced in early 2010 that he would not seek re-election.And in 2011, he took a job with the Motion Picture Association of America, earning $2.4 million that year -- more than double what his predecessor had made -- as Hollywood's top lobbyist. For his full six-and-a-half years with the nonprofit trade association, Mr. Dodd received more than $25 million, according to filings with the I.R.S.In that post, he was credited with helping to increase the distribution of American movies in China. He referred to Mr. Biden as ""our champion inside the White House."".Mr. Dodd stepped down in 2017, citing his age as a factor. But rather than retire from lobbying -- work that in 2010 he had said he would never pursue -- he joined a white-shoe law firm in 2018. In recent years, lobbying disclosure reports show, Mr. Dodd has focused on the interests of victims of terrorist attacks in Israel, representing the plaintiffs in a high-profile case brought by a group of American families against the Palestine Liberation Organization.His return to the political fore this year was both unexpected and unsurprising to former colleagues, given the presumptive Democratic nominee.Of the four co-chairs on Mr. Biden's selection committee -- which also includes Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and Cynthia Hogan, a former Biden aide -- Mr. Dodd is viewed by many in the party as a kind of first among equals.People who have spoken to Mr. Dodd understand him to be occupying something of an emissary role: collecting impressions (and sharing his own).""Chris's role is to try and bring them together and to report to Joe as to what the consensus is,"" said Barbara Boxer, a former Democratic senator from California who served with both men.As the campaign nears its choice, Mr. Biden's faith in his judgment would appear to be unswerving.In 2018, when Mr. Dodd's new law firm, Arnold & Porter, held a party to honor its newest lobbyist, the former vice president stopped in for a toast.Mr. Biden complimented the firm partners on their ""incredibly good judgment in convincing Chris to come on.""He closed with a joke.""Anyway, I just wanted to say congratulations,"" Mr. Biden said. ""And I hope I don't need you.""Kitty Bennett contributed research.From left, Senators John Kerry, Ben Nelson, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Christopher J.

1726,1931729001.xml,"NASHVILLE -- President Obama, now is the time to start talking.I appreciate the instinct to hold back, to follow the keep-quiet-about-the-new-guy tradition of former presidents. But these are not traditional times. They are unprecedented, and frankly, unpresidential.You deserve a break, but we are out here in this handbasket. There has been a press secretary hiding among bushes, an F.B.I. director who learned from television reports that he had been fired and Russians laughing in the Oval Office. Something called ""the Mooch"" happened for about 10 days, and back in May a man body slammed a reporter and then got elected to Congress.Days ago, a tiki torch maker had to issue a serious political statement disavowing white supremacists. Somehow this is happening in The New York Times, not The Onion. All of which gives me the hopeful audacity to beg you once more unto the breach, to help unpack this madness.You have held the highest office in the land for the maximum time it can be occupied. You are an expert on constitutional law and an embodiment of the ideals expounded by the so-called American dream.Mr. Obama, you are the president who got up and sang ""Amazing Grace"" after the Charleston, S.C., killings. You are the president who shed tears in public after Sandy Hook. Now we are a country troubled by the looming possibility of a constitutional crisis, and hate groups are claiming the president as theirs. We need your voice. There is not a saner, more trustworthy opinion that many of us would rather hear.I recognize and respect your deliberate approach to navigating these fraught times, but this relentless subtlety has become wearisome. Mr. Obama, now is not the time to follow the keep-quiet rules while the new administration plays moral equivocator to a much aghast nation.It's time for you to come back.I love that, after you posted on Twitter about the violence in Charlottesville, Va., you set a record for the most-liked tweet. But my joy at the news of your weighing in was complicated by your using a quotation, even one from Nelson Mandela. I looked to you for your good words. I'll keep waiting because I know they will be worth it. But where are they?In April, you spoke to students at the University of Chicago and identified your post-presidential calling to help ""prepare the next generation of leadership to take up the baton"" as ""the single most important thing I can do."" I entirely agree. But your distance remains a weight on my mind.At first, and despite the seismic tonal shifts of early 2017, it was a joy to watch you on a deserved, extended holiday. Gelato. Kitesurfing. Taking pictures of natural-haired Michelle on a yacht. You were being carefree, and it was wonderful. Then came a deeper quiet. You came back, wore your collar open, signed a book deal. I was still happy for you, but there was an ache to it.Don't get me wrong -- I've enjoyed your few public engagements so far this year. You spoke meaningfully on climate change in Milan. You eloquently repudiated the continuing attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It was heartening to see the people of Berlin receive you so warmly, and to watch you speak with Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr. Obama, you were, as ever, subtle, insightful and measured. But I know that you know that we can't be hiding behind walls.As a rule, I do not speak back to the television when I am alone. Or I didn't used to. And then, around the time of James Comey's firing, I listened to Alan Dershowitz basically announce that the apocalypse we've been dreading is upon us. I started to feel actual panic. I found myself yelling at the screen, and into the universe: ""Barack! Where are you?""By early August, this same phrase had turned into a bewildered mutter, as I listened to Representative Maxine Waters tell Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that she thinks we're ""nearing a constitutional crisis."" The fallout from Charlottesville has rendered my call to you a tired and heartbroken whisper.As a black Southern woman, I have grown accustomed to navigating a many-voiced universe. In the past months, however, I have felt keenly the absence of two voices: the collective sound of my sane Republican friends calling for inquiry and, more important, the voice of my president. Lately, the former crowd has begun to stir. Somehow, this has made the hope for your voice more urgent.Are Mr. Dershowitz and Ms. Waters right about the jeopardy of our Constitution? Will hate groups continue to claim more space on the national stage? Regarding the former, I refuse to believe that television testimony to Robert Mueller's integrity is my only respite in all of this. And regarding the latter, it beggars belief that we must address this at all, but here we are. Some of us never trusted politics until you found your way to the top job. Coming to grips with any new administration would have been hard, let alone this Kremlin-addled, Klan-endorsed turmoil we are being forced to watch.Weeks ago, I was moved to tears (of relief) watching Senator John McCain give a thumbs-down on the Republicans' health care bill. In no world could I have imagined this. But then, I could not have imagined this world.I made phone calls for you in 2008. I worked in Nashville's Democratic headquarters for much of the summer. I registered people to vote. I felt heard. In the intervening years, your voice has been one of gravity, good sense and honesty. By 2009, my president was black, and the House majority was blue.My generation graduated from college, got our first jobs and became adults all under the auspices of that truth. We learned to experience politics through the lens of your eloquent presence in the White House. In this respect, you raised us. So we are unaccustomed to all of this wildness. Just because we're grown doesn't mean we don't need to hear from the man who brought us up.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

3112,2553655886.xml,"The agreement infuriated both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, who accused the Biden administration of being soft on Russia.WASHINGTON -- The United States has dropped its threat to block the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines from Russia to Germany, officials said on Wednesday, formally setting aside a yearslong disagreement with Berlin over an energy deal that critics have warned would allow Moscow to starve Ukraine of transit fees that are crucial to Kyiv's economy.The Biden administration's decision was effectively an acknowledgment that the pipeline project was too far advanced to stop, and that relations with Germany, a crucial ally, were too important to jeopardize over the dispute.But it infuriated Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have demanded the use of economic penalties to halt the pipelines, and on Wednesday accused the administration of being soft on Russia.The pipelines, each about 750 miles long, run from Russia directly under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing Poland and Ukraine and denying those countries some transit fees. They are being built by a subsidiary of Gazprom, the Russian company that is controlled by the Kremlin, and will roughly double the amount of gas that Russia can supply directly to Germany.The $11 billion project is expected to be operational by the end of the year despite construction delays as investors grew wary of being targeted by U.S. sanctions.The new agreement appears to be a way for Mr. Biden to spin the inevitable completion of the pipelines as a kind of diplomatic victory and a defense of the interests of Poland and Ukraine, which could suffer financially. It calls for Germany to impose sanctions on Russia if it were to use its control over energy supplies to harm or endanger Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic nations or any other U.S. ally.""Nord Stream is 99 percent finished,"" President Biden told reporters Wednesday night as he prepared to head back to Washington from a trip to Cincinnati. ""The idea that anything was going to be said or done that was going to stop it is not possible.""State Department officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday said the Biden administration continued to have ""profound differences"" with Germany over the project. But the officials also pointed to a $1 billion investment fund, to be administered by Germany, to help Ukraine to reduce its dependence on Moscow's gas exports.Germany will contribute an initial $175 million to the fund as Berlin and Washington each seek private investors to help Ukraine improve its energy efficiency and energy security, officials said.The announcement followed Chancellor Angela Merkel's meetings in Washington last week with Mr. Biden, who said during the visit that the two leaders had agreed that they were ""united in our conviction that Russia should not be able to use energy as a weapon.""""I had, as you know, a very, very fruitful discussion with Angela Merkel,"" Mr. Biden said on Wednesday night. ""She's working, and the German government, on commitments that suggest that if in fact Russia takes pains to deliberately inflict pain on Ukraine and other countries, they will respond.""White House officials said on Wednesday that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has urged Congress to try to stop the project with sanctions, would visit in August.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, called the agreement with Germany ""a generational geopolitical win"" for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and ""a catastrophe for the United States and our allies.""Mr. Cruz, whose constituents in Texas include key energy exporters, has held up the confirmation of several Biden administration officials over the last several months in his insistence that the United States stop the pipelines from being completed. ""President Biden is defying U.S. law and has utterly surrendered to Putin,"" he said in a statement. ""Decades from now, Russian dictators will still be reaping billions from Biden's gift, and Europe will still be subject to Russian energy blackmail.""Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said she welcomed the diplomatic efforts with key European allies. But, she said, ""I've long contended that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline should not be completed because it empowers the Kremlin to spread its malign influence throughout Eastern Europe, threatens the economic security of our European partners and puts our global stability at risk.""""I continue to believe that,"" she said.The State Department officials bristled at the suggestion that the Biden administration had capitulated and noted that American sanctions related to the project had been imposed against 19 entities since Mr. Biden took office, compared with two during the term of President Donald J. Trump.Derek Chollet, the State Department's counselor, described the deal to senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv on Tuesday and Wednesday and promised continued American support. He also asked the Ukrainian government not to lobby Congress for additional sanctions related to the project.Germany and Russia have previously agreed to keep transit fees for natural gas flowing to Ukraine through 2024, and that is likely to be extended another year.""For the German government it remains central that Ukraine should remain a transit country even after Nord Stream 2,"" a government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, has said.The pipelines have allowed Russia to divide Germany from its European allies and from the United States. But Mr. Biden, who says he continues to oppose the project, has made it clear that his priority is China, and getting German and European support for joint policies to restrain China and limit its economic and political influence is central.Matthias Warnig, the managing director of Nord Stream AG, the company that is building and will operate the pipelines, said American sanctions and threats of sanctions had added at least 18 months and costs ""well into the hundreds of millions"" of euros.""The U.S. sanction threats have made our work much more difficult in every respect, and this also applies to certification,"" Mr. Warnig said in an interview published on July 11 in the German business newspaper Handelsblatt. ""But we are working on solutions and are sure we will find a way.""Lara Jakes reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Construction on Nord Stream 2 in the Leningrad region of Russia in June 2019.

1674,433896954.xml,"      As Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. travels through Europe this week, he wants to reassure jittery audiences that the United States will right its economy and its financial markets.   But with both sides of the Atlantic now suffering from a similar combination of sagging growth, soaring inflation and shaky banks, Mr. Paulson's visit is turning into a case of misery loving company.   ""There's no doubt that the second quarter will be a tough quarter,"" Mr. Paulson said in an interview after meeting with the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. ""There's no doubt in any of our minds that the high oil prices are going to have an impact.""   Europe's economy, which had recently been more resilient than that of the United States, has begun showing signs of an American-style slump. Manufacturing activity in the 15 countries that use the euro  shrank in June for the first time in three years, according to an influential survey of purchasing managers released on Tuesday.   ""I've never been one to accept the decoupling theory,"" Mr. Paulson said, referring to the idea that Europe was immune to a malaise in the United States. ""In a global world, we're all interrelated.""   A weaker Europe has implications for the United States, Mr. Paulson said, because the United States has benefited from buoyant economic conditions overseas, in particular through exports.   Now, he said, developing countries would provide the biggest lift to the global economy. Mr. Paulson said that Russia, which he visited on Monday, and other nations with similar economic prospects were still growing robustly, though they, too, were grappling with rising fuel and food prices.   Fears of an inflationary spiral have prompted the European Central Bank to signal that it will raise interest rates this week. Mr. Trichet, the central  bank's president, has come under intense pressure from European leaders not to tighten credit at a time of weakening economic growth. But that is not expected to deter the bank.   A higher interest rate is  likely to drive up the euro against the dollar because, with the Federal Reserve so far resisting an increase, it would widen the disparity in borrowing costs between Europe, where the central bank now has a benchmark rate at 4 percent, and the United States, where the Fed's base rate is 2 percent.   Mr. Paulson reaffirmed the importance of a strong dollar on his trip, which will end Thursday in London.   But he declined to comment on the divergence between the Fed and the European Central Bank, saying he liked independent central banks. ""Whether it is Ben Bernanke or Jean-Claude Trichet, I relish that,"" he said.    By contrast, President Nicolas Sarkozy used France's new status as the rotating president of the European Union to deliver a fresh warning to the bank not to imperil Europe's growth with a rate increase.   ""The E.C.B. must ask itself about economic growth in Europe and not just about inflation,"" Mr. Sarkozy said on the France 3 television network on Monday evening. ""You can double, triple interest rates and that will not bring a decrease in the price of a barrel of Brent,"" he said, referring to crude oil.   Even more significantly, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, reiterated concerns of a rate increase. Unlike Mr. Sarkozy, who is a regular critic of the central bank, German officials are normally scrupulous about not meddling in monetary policy.   ""The E.C.B. should consider which effects an interest rate rise would have on economic growth,"" Mr. Steinbruck said Tuesday at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, according to Reuters.   The European Central Bank has been resolute in the face of such pressure, and economists expect it to lift rates to 4.25 percent on Thursday, when its governing board is scheduled to meet. The question, given the record-setting pace of inflation, is whether it will stop there, or embark on a series of increases.   Inflation is already running at 4 percent, double the 2 percent threshold set by the bank. With oil prices continuing to rise, some economists expect it to peak at 4.2 percent in August.   ""If corporations are squeezed between rising oil prices and higher borrowing costs, that would be devastating,"" said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Bank of America in London. ""This horror scenario, which I wouldn't have believed a month ago, now seems more likely.""   The latest economic data paints a picture of gloom across much of the Continent, with manufacturing activity contracting in France, Italy and Austria. The contraction is particularly acute in Spain and Ireland, where a collapse in housing has aggravated the general malaise.   But Germany, Europe's largest economy, reported a modest expansion in activity, as well as a rebound in retail sales and a further drop in unemployment. At 7.8 percent, the jobless rate is the lowest since August 1992.   Mr. Paulson singled out these divergences as an issue for Europe's politicians and central bankers.   ""The challenge they have is that Europe is not a homogeneous group of places,"" he said. ""In Germany, although the mood has turned down a bit, you've got a much stronger situation than in Spain or Ireland.""   German banks, Mr. Paulson noted, were facing some of the same fallout from the credit crisis as those in the United States. He said he had discussed financial market regulation with Mr. Trichet as well as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whom he met earlier on Tuesday in Berlin.

2831,433345888.xml,"      Ingolf Rossberg is the mayor of this majestic eastern German city. But watching him stride around his ballroom-size office, wreathed in smoke from his cigarillo, one could mistake him for a European real estate tycoon. Yet he is that after a fashion. Mr. Rossberg reached a deal in March to sell Dresden's entire stock of 48,000 city-owned apartments to an American private equity firm, the Fortress Investment Group, for $1.2 billion. In a single stroke, Dresden wiped out its burdensome public debt. ''We had to move fast,'' he said, ''because if you had 10 German cities selling their property, it would be a buyer's market.''  That may soon be the case. German cities are lining up for a mammoth wave of foreign investment in their property. Lured by a German real estate market that is the most stagnant in any major European country, and a vast supply of well-kept public housing, American and other foreign companies have already snapped up dozens of projects in Berlin, Bremen, Essen and other German cities. Affordable public housing is a pillar of the German welfare state, and the prospect of vast pieces of it falling into the hands of pinstriped financiers from New York or London has unsettled many people here. In Dresden, 45,000 of them signed a petition opposing the sale. ''When a new owner is profit-oriented, it brings changes,'' said Peter Bartels, the chairman of the Dresden renters' association. ''We're not sure yet what kinds of changes. But we know there will be changes.'' Foreign private equity investors, mostly American and British, have already spent $25 billion since 2003 on apartments owned by German cities and companies. With the owners hungry to raise even more money, analysts forecast that 750,000 additional units will be sold over the next five years. The acquisitions have not been limited to residential real estate. A property fund owned by Goldman Sachs paid $4.7 billion in March for a controlling stake in the real estate holdings of KarstadtQuelle, Germany's largest department-store chain. ''The heavy money in London and New York sees a lot of money in German real estate,'' said Allan Saunderson, managing editor of Property Finance Europe in Frankfurt. ''We are at the beginning of a long process that will see a large chunk of Germany's public-sector housing sold.'' The foreign appetite dovetails nicely with Germany's needs: virtually every major German city is awash in debt. And with the limited health of a convalescing German economy, they have had few other ready ways to raise funds. Thanks to its sale, Dresden can promote itself as the first debt-free major city in the country. Mayor Rossberg, who selected the Fortress bid after cutting a list of 83 bidders to three finalists, said, ''We found that the interests of Fortress were parallel to the interests of Dresden.'' Not everyone agrees. The tenants who opposed the sale said they feared that Fortress would raise rents or even throw people out on the street. They question how a private equity firm, with its need for hefty returns, could own public housing without squeezing the people who live there. ''These investors have no social conscience whatsoever,'' said Thilo Kluge, 45, a tenant in a city-owned apartment who campaigned against the sale. ''They have a single interest: Make my bank account fatter.'' Some German politicians have tried to capitalize on such fears. During last year's election campaign, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muntefering , who is now the labor minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's broad-based governing coalition, referred to private equity firms as locusts, plundering German assets and exploiting the locals. Fortress, based in New York and run by bankers formerly at Goldman Sachs and the asset management firm BlackRock, seems aware of the possibility of such resentment. It has taken pains to assure tenants that it will be socially responsible. ''We want to cooperate over the next decades,'' Robert I. Kauffman, the head of Fortress European operations, said at a news conference on March 10 to announce the deal. The head of its German business, Matthias Moser, ruled out an ''aggressive strategy to raise rents.'' Fortress declined to comment for this article. The residents will be protected by an agreement, known as the Social Charter, that Fortress had to sign to stay in the bidding. The contract limits its ability to raise rents -- including those that are below market rate -- and protects tenants from being evicted. People over 60 or with severe disabilities are guaranteed lifelong tenancy. Moreover, Fortress must hold on to 34,000 of the apartments for 10 years before it sells them. And when it does, it must offer existing tenants a 15 percent reduction from the market price. Finally, it cannot renovate the apartment complexes into luxury condominiums. Analysts say the rights granted to the residents are not much different from those that govern Germany's highly regulated rental market. But that raises a question: How will Fortress recoup its billion-dollar investment? The company has said it wants to reduce the vacancy rate in the apartments, currently 17 percent. To do that, experts predict, Fortress will have to lower rents to attract new tenants. ''That would be friendly for the tenants,'' Mr. Bartels of the renters' association said, ''but it would cause problems for the city.''  Dresden, he noted, has tens of thousands of apartments owned by cooperative associations. If the rent on the Fortress apartments were to decline, it would put other cooperatives under pressure to match the lower rents. Mayor Rossberg, who is a member of the pro-market Free Democratic Party, said he would welcome a problem like that. And anyway, he noted, with 40,000 vacant apartments in the city -- a legacy of the westward migration of East Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- people already have the flexibility to move from one apartment to another. If Fortress can increase occupancy rates, analysts said, it would probably be content to wait a decade to sell the apartments. Much of its capital, Mayor Rossberg said, comes from state pension funds in the United States, which he said allowed Fortress to be a patient investor. ''The rule of thumb is that the firms only put in 25 percent of their own money,'' Mr. Saunderson of Property Finance Europe said. ''The rest is bank financing. You take out your 25 percent in a few years, and you have a rolling program of sales. People grow old and die, or leave the apartments.''  Given the timetable involved in these investments, the foreigners also appear to be betting on the local economy. Dresden, with a jobless rate of 14.6 percent, would seem to be an unpromising market. But Mayor Rossberg said the city's population had begun to grow again, as its strengthening commercial base attracted people from elsewhere in eastern Germany. In general, Germany looks less risky than it did three years ago, when the early speculators arrived. As the atmosphere brightens, analysts say that German consumers will begin to spend money again. ''Germany is a very wealthy country, but their problem is that they don't know it,'' said Philippe Tannenbaum, the head of research at EuroHypo, a German bank that finances property deals. The question is whether they will start buying real estate. Home ownership has only limited popularity in Germany, which has one of the highest percentages of renters of any advanced economy. And professional German investors have turned up their noses at their home market. ''Germans think seaside condominiums in Florida are a good thing to buy,'' Mr. Saunderson remarked, ''at the same time that Americans are bailing out of what they view as a frothy market.'' To some extent, the rush into German real estate merely reflects that lack of other good options. Real estate prices in the United States, Britain, France and Spain have risen at torrid rates for the last few years, making Germany look like a bargain. Berlin, for example, has had a vast auction of state- and city-owned apartments. In 2004, Goldman Sachs and Cerberus, a New York-based hedge fund, bought 66,000 units for $2.5 billion. Gagfah, a state-owned company, sold 80,000 apartments to Fortress for $4.4 billion. In the largest transaction to date, Terra Firma, a private equity firm based in London, paid $8.8 billion last year for 138,000 units owned by a subsidiary of E.On, the German utility company. Not every German city is cashing in on the gold rush. After Fortress acquired a stake in some apartments in Munich through the Gagfah deal, the city bought out the company. The mayor of Munich, Christian Ude, said he did not want to sell public housing to foreign investors. In Dresden, Mayor Rossberg said the opposition to the Fortress deal was more sound than fury. While 45,000 people signed the petition, out of a population close to 500,000, there are 70,000 residents in the city-owned apartments alone. That suggests, he said, relatively thin opposition. By wiping out its debt, the mayor said, Dresden would save nearly $100 million a year in interest payments, freeing money for schools, cultural programs and urban development. Mr. Kluge, the tenant who intensely opposed the sale, said he hoped he could stay in his place, a small, tidy apartment with a burbling fish tank in the living room. He has lived there since 1998, supporting himself and his family with unemployment checks and other payments. ''People are just resigned to these things happening,'' he said.

3918,1990762510.xml,"DAVOS, Switzerland -- French President Emmanuel Macron laid claim to the mantle of leader of the free world on Wednesday, with an ambitious speech before a packed assembly at the World Economic Forum.He sought to place France at the center of a mission to revamp global capitalism while spreading its spoils more equitably, forging a mode of commerce centered on innovation, yet bearing protections for workers set back by change.
Mr. Macron's hourlong speech before the annual gathering of the world's wealthy and powerful in the Swiss Alps came on the same day that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni issued their own forceful speeches toward advancing European integration, while defending the notion of international cooperation.
Collectively, they signaled that Europe -- only a year ago dismissed as a crippled economic realm fraught with political recrimination -- has regained force. Europe's leaders left no doubt that they aim to channel their newfound economic strength toward advancing the project of European integration first launched in the middle of the last century, seen as an antidote to the brutalities of two world wars.
President Trump was not in the room (he is not due to speak here until Friday). But the shadow of his America First policies hung heavily. The three speeches resonated as a broad rebuttal of the doctrine that Mr. Trump has made his own.
In contrast to Mr. Trump's pullback from international trade agreements and his renouncing of the Paris climate accord, the European leaders emphasized their commitment to prosperity through global commerce.
In place of Mr. Trump's unilateralism, the three European leaders pledged to strengthen the bonds of the European Union and the 19 nations that use the euro currency.
They underscored their commitment to multilateral approaches as the salve to trouble, including widening economic inequality, terrorism and the ravages of climate change.
""If we want to avoid this fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe, it's absolutely key,"" Mr. Macron declared. ""France is back. France is back at the core of Europe, because we will never have any French success without a European success.""
A year ago in Davos, the role of world-leading defender of globalization fell to Chinese President Xi Jinping. His address followed Britain's shocking decision to leave the European Union, and only days before Mr. Trump's inauguration.
To an audience fearful that the global, rules-based trading system was unraveling, Mr. Xi's commitment to internationalism drew a mixture of relief and acclaim. But China was at best a compromised claimant to that role, given its preferential credit for state-owned companies, its theft of intellectual property and its jailing of dissidents and journalists.
Mr. Macron put forth his own credentials as a leader singularly able to help guide Europe and the global economy.
""Our vision, our DNA in terms of the relationship between freedom and the furtherance of individual rights, is unique,"" Mr. Macron said.
He described a sense of responsibility to translate French values into a form of capitalism that can deliver growth along with increased opportunities for middle-class and working people.
""It's a transformational moment for Europe,"" said Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. ""There is clearly determination to deepen European governance. These leaders do believe in the rule of law. They do believe in globalization.""
Among the many casualties of Europe's decade-long economic crisis was a sense of collective purpose among the region's leaders. The downturn was exacerbated by the unique defects of the euro -- a shared currency that operates without a joint budget or political agreement among member states.
Mr. Macron has devoted his first months in office to arguing for the creation of a shared eurozone finance minister along with euro-wide budgets, enabling better coordination of economic policies when crisis returns.
Ms. Merkel has expressed cautious support while assiduously avoiding blessing anything that smacks of transferring German wealth to the less prosperous countries of the Mediterranean -- a radioactive proposition among German voters.
The German chancellor has in recent weeks grappled with complex negotiations toward forming a coalition government composed of her Christian Democratic Union and the more left-leaning Social Democratic Party after inconclusive elections last fall.
Many analysts have assumed that political fragility in Germany would complicate Mr. Macron's efforts to win German support for his integration proposals. But the coalition taking shape would bring a more pro-European orientation, many analysts say.
""I came here thinking about the fractured world, and one day later I feel I'm in a converged world,"" said Charles-Edouard Bouée, chief executive of Roland Berger, a global consultancy with offices in Shanghai and Munich.
In her speech here on Wednesday, Ms. Merkel reaffirmed her commitment to completing a so-called banking union, a system that shares the risks of financial breakdown across national borders.
She cast the drive to better integrate Europe as a historical responsibility of grave import, noting that the concept of the European Union dates back to the effort to limit future bloodshed in Europe by building economic ties.
""We have to ask ourselves, when we have fewer and fewer people who remember these events of history, have we learned the lessons of history?"" Ms. Merkel asked.
""Many people seem to worry, will multilateralism find an answer to the problems that mankind has in a fair and equitable way?"" Ms. Merkel said, seemingly referring to Mr. Trump. ""We think that shutting ourselves off against the world, isolating ourselves, will not lead to a good future. Protectionism is not the right answer.""
For years, Italy has been the face of Europe's most deep-seated problems: its banks stuffed with terrible loans, its communities full of young people who have moved in with their parents for lack of jobs.
But even Italy is now sharing in Europe's economic expansion, though joblessness remains rampant. The country's prime minister used the stage here to argue that now is the moment to attack economic inequality. Either that, or the forces of populism will triumph, he warned -- a clear worry about Italy's approaching national elections, and the ascendant Five Star party, which has been hostile to the euro.
""We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers,"" Mr. Gentiloni said. ""This worry, and these frustrations, are our main concern.""
These sorts of mission statements are increasingly dominating the political conversation in Europe -- nowhere more than in France, where Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, has pledged to make his country more appealing to business while strengthening unemployment benefits and training for castoff workers.
The centerpiece of Mr. Macron's efforts are the labor reforms he introduced last summer, making it easier for employers to terminate workers. In his speech here, he cast that not as a means of relinquishing labor to the unsentimental winds of capitalism, but rather giving start-up companies relief from the strictures of national labor contracts negotiated by unions.
Employers have in recent weeks used their newly acquired authority to fire to do just that, while the supposed Nordic-style worker protections Mr. Macron has promised have yet to materialize.
Mr. Macron promised to fill the void, vowing to spend 15 billion euros -- about $18.6 billion -- over the next five years on education and retraining.
""If I cannot explain to people that globalization is good for them, and that it will help them develop their own lives, then they will be the nationalists, the extremists who want to get out of the system,"" he said. ""And they will win in every country.""
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

305,2111049766.xml,"BERLIN -- Leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition reached a deal on Sunday to resolve a standoff over the future of the country's intelligence chief, a dispute that has still further frayed their tenuous alliance.The spy chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, was removed from his job last week at the insistence of the center-left Social Democrats after he appeared to play down recent violence against migrants. Critics suggested that Mr. Maassen was too sympathetic to the far right and that he might overlook its ties to neo-Nazi groups.
But with Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a fellow conservative, in his corner, Mr. Maassen could not simply be shown the door. Instead, coalition leaders agreed to replace him as the intelligence chief but give him a new job as a deputy interior minister -- a promotion with a hefty pay increase.
The Social Democrats were infuriated, and their leader, Andrea Nahles, called for the deal to be renegotiated.
On Sunday, coalition leaders agreed instead to make Mr. Maassen a ""special adviser"" at the interior ministry with responsibility for ""European and international issues,"" Mr. Seehofer said. He will remain at his current pay level.
In addition, a Social Democrat who held the post of deputy interior minister, Gunther Adler, will now keep his job rather than making way for Mr. Maassen.
Ms. Nahles will have to sell the new compromise to her party's leadership on Monday.
""I think it is a very good signal that we took the criticism of our decision on Tuesday evening seriously and were able to correct it,"" she told reporters. She declared that ""over all, the foundation has been laid for us to return to substantive work.""
The dispute has clouded the government's future at a time when the three parties face major challenges in state elections. The infighting appears to be weighing down their support.
A year ago in a national election, all three coalition parties lost ground to the far-right Alternative for Germany party.
The coalition has already been through one crisis that threatened its survival, when Ms. Merkel and Mr. Seehofer faced off in June over whether to turn back some migrants at the German-Austrian border.
Responding to violent right-wing protests against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz, Mr. Maassen said his agency had no reliable evidence that foreigners were being ""hunted"" down in the streets -- the term Ms. Merkel had used.
A video posted by a left-wing group showed protesters chasing down and attacking a foreigner, but Mr. Maassen questioned its authenticity.
Mr. Seehofer said that Mr. Maassen was a ""highly competent"" employee and that he would not dismiss him. He accused the Social Democrats of running a ""campaign"" against Mr. Maassen.

2052,1447093494.xml,"       Perhaps there's more we could do to antagonize American allies. The National Security Agency could tweet Chancellor Angela Merkel's juicy phone conversations, or post video clips on YouTube of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan singing in the shower. The Pentagon could fly drones over Paris, dropping Big Macs on fine restaurants, just to show that we can. Government officials fume at Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning for harm they did to American security. Fair enough. But the latest uproar over our N.S.A. spying is a reminder of how senior American officials have themselves jeopardized our strategic interests -- by overreaching and doing things just because they could. Our national security policy has gone off the rails since 9/11. For a dozen years, security has been an obsession, rarely constrained by a weighing of trade-offs, and to what result? We have sought every tactical advantage, and this sometimes leads -- as in eavesdropping of foreign allies -- to strategic losses.  We have doubled spending on intelligence, after inflation, to more than $70 billion annually. More people have ""top secret"" clearances than live in the District of Columbia -- and it was inevitable that there would be some rogues among them. When everything is classified, the system loses credibility, transparency and accountability. The war on terror led us to fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, achieving few obvious gains but costing thousands of American lives. For every jihadi we killed, we appear to have created several new ones.  As a Chinese saying goes, we lifted up a rock and dropped it on our own feet. When he took office, President Obama seemed likely to reorient security policy. He did, indeed, bring troops back from Iraq and, after a misconceived ""surge"" in Afghanistan, is winding down our presence there. But, over all, his security policy is surprisingly similar to President Bush's: Guantánamo remains an affront to our values and the world's, N.S.A. spying programs continue in force, drone strikes have been stepped up, and the White House has tried to curb serious public conversation about drones, spying and cyberwarfare. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistle-blowers under the Espionage Act than all previous administrations put together. The latest scandal involving our spying on European leaders is symptomatic of this larger myopia about our strategic interests. It's true that some of the outrage in Europe is affected. As Bernard Kouchner, the former foreign minister of France, bluntly noted in a radio interview: ""Let's be honest. We eavesdrop, too. Everyone is listening to everyone else. But we don't have the same means as the United States, which makes us jealous."" Still, our eavesdropping seems to have broken German law, as well as the first rule of spying: Don't get caught. If President Obama really didn't know that 35 world leaders were being listened to, something was wrong with intelligence oversight. A former C.I.A. senior official says that before 9/11, that kind of monitoring of world leaders was always cleared by the White House. ""Anything with senior government officials or heads of state was checked quite carefully, at least with the national security adviser, if not the president,"" the official told me. Yet, since 9/11, our security policy has been on autopilot: If we can spy on Merkel, let's do it! If we can use a drone to kill a suspected terrorist, go for it! If we can keep people indefinitely in Guantánamo, why not? Our hubris has undercut America's greatest foreign policy advantage: our soft power. In Pakistan, for example, our drone strikes have removed some dangerous militants. But drone strikes deeply antagonized the Pakistani people, tarnishing our image and reducing our leverage in a pivotal country. Our drones damaged our own influence in Pakistan more than the Taliban's. As David Rohde of Reuters puts it: ""The United States obsession with Al Qaeda is doing more damage to the nation than the terrorist group itself."" Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that the majority of Europeans today have no memory of the Cold War and that, as a result, we have less leeway today to antagonize our allies. ""This is a different geopolitical era,"" he said. ""We can't assume that people are for us.""  Yes, there is still a place for drones, for spying on allies, for the N.S.A. But they need to be subjected to scrutiny, context and brakes, as they were before 9/11.  Commercial aviation would be safer if we were all required to fly stark naked. But we accept trade-offs -- such as clothing -- and thus some small risk. In the same way, it's time to pause for a breath in the security realm and start examining the trade-offs, rather than just doing things because we can.   ",2013-10-31
3240,1684818201.xml,"       ATHENS --  As the Greek government faces a looming debt payment, top European leaders met in Berlin on Monday night to reach a consensus over what to do about Greece, signaling the urgent need to unlock emergency financing for the cash-starved country and avoid a devastating default. But a growing political backlash in Greece adds to the uncertainty about whether a deal can be sealed. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras faces increasing dissent within his leftist Syriza party over creditors' demands for austerity terms as a condition for releasing the aid. Greece's main creditors -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and eurozone countries -- have refused to release 7.2 billion euros in bailout funds until Athens agrees to a series of economic reforms and spending cuts. They have been at an impasse for months. But the unexpected gathering of top representatives of the creditors is an urgent bid to move the talks forward. The assembly included Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; President François Hollande of France; Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission; Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director; and Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B. The leaders discussed how Greece could meet its obligations in June but also make a series of large payments during the summer, said a person with knowledge of the discussions. An extension of the current aid program is one option. The creditors did not comment publicly on the meeting. Ms. Merkel and the other leaders will avoid presenting anything to Greece that looks like an ultimatum, the person said. But they are likely to formulate what will amount to a last, best offer, with limited scope for negotiation. They may also present Greece with a deadline to provide an answer, though it was not certain when the deadline would be, the person said. Unless they strike an agreement soon, Greece may not be able to make a series of coming debt payments. On Friday, Greece must make a [euro]300 million loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund, and it owes [euro]1.2 billion later this month. Should a deal be signed this week and the cash made available, Greece should be able to survive financially through the summer, according to people involved in the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly. But Mr. Tsipras would still face an even steeper political challenge at home when its current [euro]240 billion bailout deal expires at the end of this month. Because Greece owes tens of billions of euros more to its creditors, Athens will probably need to consider applying for a third bailout package, estimated at [euro]30 billion to [euro]50 billion, in the fall. Any new aid would most likely be conditioned on further budget-cutting and revenue-raising requirements that Syriza might find hard to accept. Far-left Syriza lawmakers have become increasingly agitated recently, accusing Mr. Tsipras of making too many compromises on the anti-austerity pledges that helped sweep the party to power in January's elections. A new political uproar broke when a group of Syriza lawmakers refused to back the government's nominee for a new representative at the International Monetary Fund, Elena Panaritis, a former Greek parliamentarian who once worked at the World Bank. In a letter on Sunday, more than 40 Syriza members, mostly lawmakers, took issue with her support of Greece's last international bailout agreement in 2012, which the party considered to have been unfair and overly harsh. Ms. Panaritis withdrew from consideration on Monday, citing the opposition. Although symbolic, it was the latest in a series of uprisings within Syriza, which during the election campaign had promised to take a hard line with Greece's creditors in debt negotiations and to resist austerity measures. A hard-left faction recently pressed for but lost an internal central committee party vote to have Athens stop paying its creditors altogether if they demanded further austerity. Mr. Tsipras is facing an array of pressures as critics from both the left and right in the Greek government question whether he has a viable plan to restart the economy, which slid back into a recession in the first quarter. At the same time, Greece's creditors, the I.M.F. in particular, have resisted unlocking any aid unless the government can show that it will put its finances on a sound footing and run enough of an operating surplus to make regular debt payments. The dispute over Ms. Panaritis on Monday ""shows that there's a lot of exasperation in Syriza ahead of a deal with creditors,"" said Harry Papasotiriou, a professor of political science at the Panteion University in Athens and the head of the Institute of International Relations. Even if dissent within Syriza deepens, the government would probably band together to push through any legislation needed to secure the bailout funds. Few lawmakers want to precipitate a default or force Greece to exit the currency union. But the hard-liners of Mr. Tsipras's party could eventually break away, analysts said, especially the Left Platform, a faction that has already pushed for Greece to stop paying its creditors if they continue with ""blackmailing tactics."" Negotiations over the current bailout have been dragging on since February, as Mr. Tsipras has resisted measures that he said would worsen hardship for the Greek people, including heavier pension cuts and an increased consumption tax. Despite rumors on Monday that an ""interim deal"" aimed at securing crucial loans to Greece was imminent, European officials indicated that there was still some way to go before an agreement could be sealed. ""Progress has been made but we are not yet there,"" Mina Andreeva, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said Monday. In a bid to placate his domestic audience, Mr. Tsipras lashed out at the slowness of the talks in an op-ed piece in the French daily newspaper Le Monde that was published over the weekend. He put the onus for an agreement on Greece's creditors and blamed the lack of an deal on their insistence on ""absurd proposals"" and a ""total indifference"" to the anti-austerity mandate that he said the nation handed him in January. The talks have stuck on several points. Both sides have varying forecasts for the country's primary budget surplus, which is the amount of money the government can draw on to make debt payments after meeting its operating expenses. Greece wants to limit budget cuts and set the primary surplus below 1 percent, compared with an original target of 3 percent for this year. Opinions also differ on how the value-added tax system should be changed to lift revenue. Overhauling the pension system and labor laws remain contentious issues; Mr. Tsipras indicated in the op-ed that Greece already had made concessions in those areas. In the meantime, Greece's finances continue to deteriorate as deepening political uncertainty accelerates a decline in tax receipts and withdrawals of deposits from the nation's banks. Last week, Greece's central bank reported that deposits fell in April to [euro]133 billion, the lowest level in a decade, after savers withdrew nearly [euro]5 billion from the banks during the month. More than [euro]30 billion was withdrawn between the end of last November and the end of April, according to the Bank of Greece.

1973,881315078.xml,"      PARIS -- As European leaders on Friday tried to calm fears that the region's sovereign debt problems were spinning beyond politicians' control, Italy's prime minister said finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrial nations would meet ""within days"" to discuss the volatile financial crisis.   The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose nation has been viewed as the next potential debt-laden domino to fall, also announced a number of measures Italy would take to restore the confidence of investors and creditors.    The G-7 meeting is meant to show that leaders are taking action to address the crisis, even before votes occur in national parliaments next month to expand Europe's rescue fund for its most financially troubled members.    While no details of the meeting's agenda were given, the situation ""requires coordinated action,"" Mr. Berlusconi said. ""We have to recognize that the world has entered a global financial crisis that concerns all countries.""   For all the hum of activity on Friday, though, many economists and analysts remained unconvinced that sufficient steps were being taken to resolve the problems engulfing the European nations that share the euro.    European stocks were down for a second consecutive day on Friday, on the gnawing realization that Europe and the United States may face fundamental economic problems for years to come.   The turmoil prompted a flurry of phone calls between President Nicolas Sarkozy of France from his vacation retreat on the French Riviera, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who had chosen an August getaway to Italy. Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy also each spoke with President Obama on Friday, the White House said, but offered no details on their discussions.    Mr. Berlusconi, meanwhile, spoke by phone Friday with Mrs. Merkel and, separately, with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, and with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain -- the other big debt-saddled European country that, like Italy, is seen as teetering.    Mr. Zapatero of Spain, whose economy is in greater peril as investors drive up borrowing costs, also spoke separately to both Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel from his vacation in Andalucia.   At a hastily called news conference, Mr. Berlusconi, who has been criticized for being too slow to recognize that Italy's debt problems threaten the euro union, said his country would take various steps to address the crisis.    He said Italy would aim for a balanced budget a year earlier than a previously stated 2013 deadline, seek a constitutional balanced-budget amendment and make other moves to liberalize the nation's economy -- which is so sclerotic from bureaucratic rules that it has barely grown for a decade.    Parliament may shorten its August recess to pass the measures, Mr. Berlusconi said. He appeared alongside the economy minister, Giulio Tremonti, whom Mr. Berlusconi had recently treated with public disdain that added to the market's concerns about Italy.   Many analysts remain skeptical that European leaders have grasped the problems confronting them.   ""Politicians have done everything to demonstrate they are not ahead of the curve,"" said Stefan Schneider, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ""That is hitting market confidence and creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop.""   Just days after Washington struck a harrowing, last-minute deal to lift America's debt ceiling, a stark reality has come crashing in on both sides of the Atlantic. Neither the United States nor Europe has yet fully recovered from the financial crisis that spread from spring 2007 through early 2009.   Instead, brief bright spots of recovery have been overshadowed by rising unemployment and anemic economies, especially as debt-reduction austerity programs in Europe and spending cuts in the United States weigh on growth.   Signs of economic weakness continue to emerge. New data indicates that industrial output fell in June in Italy and Spain, and both economies grew at a tepid pace in the second quarter. While the German economy remained strong, industrial production there slid in June, by 1.1 percent, as construction activity also slackened.   Meanwhile, leaders in Brussels on Friday were trying undo the damage wrought by Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, a day after he frightened investors by conceding that Europe was gripped by political paralysis.    His remarks, which angered German policy makers, were one of the catalysts for the markets' downward spiral Thursday, along with a half-hearted attempt by the European Central Bank to bolster the bonds of the most deeply troubled debtors.   Many analysts say that the inability of politicians to speak with a unified voice, whether about the debt ceiling in the United States or the debt crisis threatening the foundations of the euro monetary union itself, is at the heart of these problems.   China, whose surging growth depends on the West, voiced new worries Friday about the declining fortunes of its two largest trading partners.    ""Europe's debt problems are still developing, and the U.S. sovereign debt default risk is escalating,"" China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said during a visit to Poland. He urged all countries to ""further increase communication and coordination.""   Europe's leaders seemed to take the hint -- for now.    ""All of us who are in responsible positions in Europe will have to do much better in order to ensure verbal discipline and rigor,"" Ollie Rehn, the European economics commissioner, said at a hastily called news conference in Brussels on Friday.    European officials, he said, were ""working night and day to put flesh on the bones"" of an agreement in principle they struck in July for a second bailout of Greece and to reinforce its sovereign rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. The fund is supposed to keep the economies of Italy and Spain from succumbing to market attacks the way Greece, Ireland and Portugal did.   ""Once investors understand that all this work is under way behind the scenes, they will be reassured,"" Mr. Rehn said. ""It is not as if the fundamentals of the Italian or Spanish economies have changed overnight.""    That may be. But with Greece, Ireland and Portugal having received an unprecedented bailout from their European partners, investors are now wary of any country with low growth and high debt -- like Spain and Italy, with their much larger economies.    European parliaments are scheduled to vote on expanding the capacity and scope of the rescue fund after their vacations. But the worry is that financial markets will not wait that long, and will drive up borrowing costs for Italy and Spain to levels that will make it much harder for them to maintain a sustainable debt load.    ""If they had agreed on those measures nine months ago it would have prevented the crisis from spiraling to this extent,"" said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ""But this is too little too late.""   For all their declarations, Europe's leaders are still not taking the ultimate step that many analysts say would shore up the euro union: moving toward greater fiscal federalism, a system that would make Europe look more like the United States.    The reasons for resisting are deep-seated: No country wants to give up its sovereignty. Even discussions about issuing euro bonds are met with fierce resistance in Germany, as are ideas for a pan-European financial regulator and Europe-wide deposit insurance to guard against instability in the region's banks.   Germany warned Friday that it would oppose any plan to introduce euro bonds. Joachim Pfeiffer, a lawmaker and economics spokesman for Mrs. Merkel's parliamentary bloc, called them ""poison.""    Another move that critics say would stem the crisis would be for the central bank to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, which would keep their rates from spiraling to the levels that forced Greece and others to take a bailout. But the central bank sees this as a weapon of last resort and is loath to use it.   Mr. Sarkozy has something else to fear. If the crises in Italy and Spain cannot be tamed, France, as one of the major contributors to the cleanup operation, would be in an increasingly weak position.   Spreads on benchmark French bonds have widened against ultrasafe German bonds. And while growth is not lagging, France's structural deficit is high. If the size of the rescue fund were to increase enough to protect Spain and Italy, investors might start to look askance at France's ability to underwrite its share, analysts said.

2121,2472414863.xml,"The Brexit pact preserves crucial E.U. principles like the single market, and lets the bloc look ahead to its future without Britain.BRUSSELS -- The European Union emerges from fraught negotiations with Britain over its exit from the bloc with a sense of satisfaction -- that it has maintained its unity and its core principles, especially the integrity of the single market of now 450 million consumers that is the foundation of its influence.And it is now looking ahead to its life without Britain.Ursula von der Leyen, the trilingual German who is the head of the European Commission, the bloc's powerful bureaucracy, emerged from the wrangling with her political profile and reputation enhanced.Normally at the end of a negotiation she felt joy, Ms. von der Leyen said on Thursday evening. But today, she said, ""I only feel quiet satisfaction and, frankly speaking, relief.""It was time ""to look to the future,"" she said. ""It is time to leave Brexit behind. Our future is made in Europe.""It has been a satisfying end to a difficult year for Ms. von der Leyen and the European Union as a whole. The bloc was buffeted by serious challenges ranging from the pandemic to securing a new seven-year budget and a sizable virus recovery fund to help those countries most badly hit. That fund embodies a collective European debt for the first time.The E.U. also has had to cope with internal challenges to the rule of law and continuing antagonism from President Trump; craft a tougher stance toward China and Turkey; agree on sanctions against Belarus; try to find a coherent response to calls for strategic autonomy and more European defense; come together on climate goals; and prepare positions for the administration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.Compared with many of those issues, Brexit was always a ""third-order problem,"" said Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, a Brussels research institution.Still, he said, ""the deal is quite an achievement,"" one that he and many others had thought unlikely even a week ago.But Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the revolving presidency of the bloc until the end of the year, ""really wanted a deal,"" Mr. Wolff said. The Germans, with Europe and NATO as core national interests, see Britain as too close, too big and too important to be allowed to drift away without one.Ms. von der Leyen, who had served in Ms. Merkel's cabinets and is close to her, and who got this job at the instigation of President Emmanuel Macron of France, was ideally situated to do the final compromises -- checking back with European capitals -- that have finally produced a deal.""I'm sure the Germans made their desires clear"" to Ms. von der Leyen, Mr. Wolff said. ""But you need the president of the commission to directly call the Elysée and the Chancellery and do the deal.""The final deal is a free-trade agreement that recognizes Britain's desire to leave the single market and the customs union while preserving tariff-free, quota-free trade in goods with the European Union.To that end, Britain agreed to a mechanism, with arbitration and possible tariffs for violations, that would keep its regulations and subsidies roughly in line with those of Brussels, to prevent unfair competition. But the deal will require inspections of goods to prevent smuggling, especially of live animals.The deal also covers many mundane but crucial matters of visas, health insurance, and air, rail and road travel. It treats Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, as within the E.U. customs area to prevent the need for a hard border on the island, but requires some checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.And the deal reallocates fishing areas and quotas, given that Britain is now an independent coastal state.Real power in the European Union rests with the member states, but they authorized the commission and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to hammer out the complicated treaty while laying down their red lines.Mr. Barnier, working with a varied series of counterparts as British governments changed, brought the member states together. By constantly briefing them and the European Parliament, he managed to keep the bloc unified despite British efforts to deal directly with various capitals.When the hardest political decisions had to be made, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain had to speak to Ms. von der Leyen. Though their relationship is cool -- she seems vaccinated against the shambling charm of Mr. Johnson -- she delivered.If Henry Kissinger used to complain that the European Union had no phone number to call, the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force 11 years ago, did much to clarify matters and to personalize the bloc into three presidents -- Charles Michel of the European Council of member states and David Sassoli of the European Parliament, as well as Ms. von der Leyen.So while Mr. Johnson's predecessors used to complain bitterly about the power and whimsy of Ms. von der Leyen's predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, Mr. Johnson did have a number to call.In the end, this is a narrow free-trade deal, but one that grants Britain more trading rights within the European Union than any other third country. But it does create a lot of paperwork and delays and does not include services, which make up some 80 percent of the British economy.And it will inevitably have a larger and more negative impact on Britain, given the comparative size of the two entities. Britain earns about 13 percent of its gross domestic product from exports to the European Union, which earns just 3 percent of its G.D.P. from exports to Britain.But the deal lays the groundwork for more talks and better relations. Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister for Britain, calls this ""Brexiternity,"" given the many years of talking still to come.Ms. von der Leyen's tenure began rockily, with a concentration on migration as the virus took hold in Europe and began to paralyze movement of goods and people, even within the Schengen zone of free movement. Health was never a central competence of Brussels, left to the states, and Ms. von der Leyen and the commission often seemed at a loss.She was also criticized for being too aloof, for working with too small a coterie of advisers and for engaging a private company to improve her public relations.But greatly aided by her close relationship with the German and French leaders, she pulled the commission together to improve the movement of goods and people, and to organize collective purchases of personal protective equipment and then of possible vaccines, at a favorable price.She also basked in the glow of the German-French compromise that finally allowed collective debt to be created for the virus recovery fund. It also led just this month to agreement on the seven-year budget, the fund and the ability to condition some future spending on adherence by member states -- Hungary and Poland in particular -- to the rule of law.There was also agreement in long discussions over climate goals, to more realistically hope to become carbon neutral by 2050. Much of that groundwork had been done by the commission.As usual with the E.U.'s 27 member states, the victories are hard-fought and not always easily explained. But a Brexit deal was either going to be done by the end of the year or not. And Ms. von der Leyen delivered.""Does that mean that she has become a strong commission president?"" Mr. Wolff, the Bruegel analyst, said. ""I'm not sure I would go so far. But this was important, it was delivered, and it would have been a mess if it had not been delivered, and European citizens would not have understood a failure on top of the economic damage already done by the virus.""The Brexit deal burnished the profile of Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, onscreen at a climate meeting.

1425,1820408388.xml,"       WHEN representatives from the United States and other countries gathered in Evian, France, in 1938 to discuss the Jewish refugee crisis caused by the Nazis, they exuded sympathy for Jews -- and excuses about why they couldn't admit them. Unto the breach stepped a 33-year-old woman from Massachusetts named Martha Sharp. With steely nerve, she led one anti-Nazi journalist through police checkpoints in Nazi-occupied Prague to safety by pretending that he was her husband. Another time, she smuggled prominent Jewish opponents of Naziism, including a leading surgeon and two journalists, by train through Germany, by pretending that they were her household workers. ""If the Gestapo should charge us with assisting the refugees to escape, prison would be a light sentence,"" she later wrote in an unpublished memoir. ""Torture and death were the usual punishments."" Sharp was in Europe because the Unitarian Church had asked her and her husband, Waitstill Sharp, a Unitarian minister, if they would assist Jewish refugees. Seventeen others had refused the mission, but the Sharps agreed -- and left their two small children behind in Wellesley, Mass. Their story is told in a timely and powerful new Ken Burns documentary, ""Defying the Nazis: The Sharps' War."" The documentary will air on PBS on Tuesday evening -- just as world leaders conclude two days of meetings in New York City about today's global refugee crisis, an echo of the one in the late 1930s. ""There are parallels,"" notes Artemis Joukowsky, a grandson of the Sharps who conceived of the film and worked on it with Burns. ""The vitriol in public speech, the xenophobia, the accusing of Muslims of all of our problems -- these are similar to the anti-Semitism of the 1930s and '40s."" The Sharps' story is a reminder that in the last great refugee crisis, in the 1930s and '40s, the United States denied visas to most Jews. We feared the economic burden and worried that their ranks might include spies. It was the Nazis who committed genocide, but the U.S. and other countries also bear moral responsibility for refusing to help desperate people. That's a thought world leaders should reflect on as they gather in New York to discuss today's refugee crisis -- and they might find inspiration from those like the Sharps who saw the humanity in refugees and are today honored because of it. Take Poland, where some Poles responded to Nazi occupation by murdering Jews, while the Polish resistance (including, I'm proud to say, my father's family) fought back and tried to wake the world's conscience. One Pole, Witold Pilecki, sneaked into Auschwitz to gather intelligence and alert the world to what was happening. Likewise, a Polish farmer named Jozef Ulma and his wife, Wiktoria, sheltered desperate members of two Jewish families in their house. The Ulmas had six small children and every reason to be cautious, but they instead showed compassion. Someone reported them, and the Gestapo raided the Ulmas' farmhouse. The Nazis first shot the Jews dead, and then took retribution by executing not just Jozef and Wiktoria (who was seven months pregnant) but also all their children. The entire family was massacred. Another great hero was Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese consul general in France as the war began. Portugal issued strict instructions to its diplomats to reject most visa requests from Jews, but Sousa Mendes violated those orders. ""I would rather stand with God and against man,"" he said, ""than with man and against God."" By some estimates, he issued visas for 30,000 refugees. Furious at the insubordination, Portugal's dictator recalled Sousa Mendes and put him on trial for violating orders. Sousa Mendes was convicted and his entire family was blacklisted, so almost all his children were forced to emigrate. Sousa Mendes survived by eating at soup kitchens and selling family furniture; he died in 1954 in poverty, debt and disgrace. ""The family was destroyed,"" notes Olivia Mattis, president of a foundation set up in 2010 to honor Sousa Mendes, who saved her father's family. As today's leaders gather for their summit sessions, they should remember that history eventually sides with those who help refugees, not with those who vilify them. Currently, only a small number of leaders have shown real moral courage on refugees -- hurray for Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau -- and even President Obama's modest willingness to accept 10,000 Syrians has led him to be denounced by Donald Trump. Without greater political will, this week's meetings may be remembered as no better than the 1938 Evian Conference, and history will be unforgiving. ""We must think of Sousa Mendes's heroism in today's context,"" Jorge Helft, a Holocaust survivor who as a French boy received one of Sousa Mendes's visas, told me. ""I have dinners in Paris where people start saying we have to kick all these people out, there are dangerous people among them."" He paused and added, ""I remember being on a ship to New York and hearing that some Americans didn't want to let us in because there were Nazi spies among us. ""Yes, there might have been Nazi spies, but a tiny minority,"" he said, just as there might be spies among Syrian refugees today, but again a tiny minority. ""Ninety-five percent or more of these people are decent, and they are fleeing from death. So let's not forget them."" I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

3875,1909094903.xml,"The British, sleepwalking into what Will Hutton of The Guardian has called ""a national act of self-harm on an epic scale,"" have voted to be near ungovernable -- a condition in which the enfeebled Prime Minister Theresa May claims she can offer ""certainty,"" but that in fact constitutes, as she has conceded, a ""mess.""The epic self-harm is, of course, Britain's planned exit by 2019 from the European Union, the foundation of its prosperity and strategic heft over more than four decades. The self-inflicted mess stems from the prime minister's humiliation in an election last week: call it May-hem. She is set to limp, vulnerable to the whims of her Conservative Party and to any crisis, into a rickety government propped up by a bunch of rabid Ulster Unionists who are the ideological heirs of the firebrand preacher, Ian Paisley.An inept campaign saw May promising ""strong and stable"" government so often it became a joke. Britain, on the eve of a momentous negotiation that will define the lives of the youth who never wanted ""Brexit,"" now has the opposite: weak and wobbly government. This will mean that May has to compromise more; hence a softer departure from the Union, if there's enough political coherence even for that. Those who cling, as I do, to the faint hope that Brexit will collapse under the weight of its folly have been given a fillip; this is not over.May has been repudiated for her arrogance, but above all for her utter vacuity. Almost single-handedly she revived the Labour Party of the leftist Jeremy Corbyn, who at least appeared to believe in something.May was for remaining in the Union before she was against it; at which point all she could say was ""Brexit means Brexit."" This tautology, combined with May's laughable fantasy of taking Britain ""global"" by exiting a single market of more than a half-billion people, summed up the nothingness of a decision informed by lies, fueled by jingoism, and spearheaded by charlatans.The Conservative Party through a double own-goal -- first the needless Brexit referendum and then May's needless snap election -- has delivered the country to polarization. The political center has evaporated. The extremes, and The Daily Mail, have won. Economic downturn, fueled by uncertainty, is almost sure to follow.Together, Britain and the United States have succumbed to a strange delusion of restored greatness, symbolized by May's embrace of Donald Trump. It is the allies' un-finest hour. They have turned inward; they have turned nasty. Trump's planned visit to Britain later this year, a sop to his vainglory that revealed British desperation at the loss of Europe, is on hold -- because a sitting American president is that unpopular in London! To sabotage British goodwill toward America to this degree is something, even for Trump.There is a vacuum where Anglo-American liberalism once stood: Angela Merkel's Germany and Emmanuel Macron's France have stepped up to face down Vladimir Putin and his ilk. The postwar order had a good run: 1945-2017.Fintan O'Toole offered a good summary of Brexit in The New York Review of Books: ""Strip away the post-imperial make-believe and the Little England nostalgia, and there's almost nothing there, no clear sense of how a middling European country with little native industry can hope to thrive by cutting itself off from its biggest trading partner and most important political alliance.""Still, it's what the people, or at least a narrow majority, wanted. That has to be respected, unless the people change their mind.May's other mantra was, ""No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal."" That's off the table, unless Ireland along with British prosperity is to be sacrificed on the Brexit altar. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, whose ten seats are now essential to May's flimsy majority, are anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage, but even they are not so retrograde as to want a hard border with Ireland, an E.U. member, imposed as a result of a chaotic exit. Nor do they want the border controls that would accompany British withdrawal from the customs union. May's D.U.P. dalliance does not come free.The prime minister will also have to listen more to Conservatives, like Ken Clarke, who have opposed a hard Brexit. She will have to accept that the E.U. is going to exact a price for this decision: Britain cannot have its cake and eat it. If the country wants to remain in the single market, overwhelmingly in its interest, it will have to accept free movement of people, but then, as Hugo Dixon observed on Infacts.org, ""Wouldn't we be better off staying in the E.U., where we have lots of influence?""Weak and wobbly means weak and wobbly. May could well fall within the next two years, possibly leading to another election. A parliament that is restive may reject any deal she does cobble together. Buyers' regret was evident in the Labour surge. It is no longer wishful thinking to believe such regret could yet lead to a second referendum, based this time on real terms rather than wretched lies.You can follow me on Twitter (@NYTimesCohen) or join me on Facebook.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

809,2032329427.xml,"BERLIN -- A few weeks ago, it felt as if a trade war pitting the United States against allies like Australia, Canada and the European Union was over before it even began. The Trump administration dispensed so many temporary exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs that many countries figured the threats were just political theater.But with only days left before the exemptions expire and punitive tariffs take effect, it's dawning on foreign leaders that decades of warm relations with the United States carry little weight with a president dismissive of diplomatic norms and hostile toward the ground rules of international trade.What began as a way to protect American steel and aluminum jobs has since become a cudgel that the Trump administration is using to extract concessions in other areas, including car exports to Europe or negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.As a May 1 deadline looms, the decision on whether to grant permanent exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, and to whom, appears likely to come down to the whims of President Trump, who has seesawed between scrapping and rejoining global trade deals.The European Union, the United States' biggest trading partner, indicated over the weekend that it was losing hope of reaching an agreement in the face of what many of the region's political leaders regard as unreasonable demands. While a last-minute extension of the deadline is still possible, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who each met with President Trump in Washington last week, spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain over the weekend about enacting retaliatory tariffs if the European Union did not receive an exemption.The German government said in a statement that Ms. Merkel, Mr. Macron and Ms. May agreed that if the tariffs go into force, ""The European Union should be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules.""The uncertainty is sowing chaos in international supply networks. Car companies and other manufacturers do not know whether ships carrying steel may suddenly be barred from American ports.Some countries are confident they will avoid the tariffs. Australia is treating an exemption as if it's a done deal. Brazil, which primarily exports slab steel to American manufacturers, is hoping to escape by agreeing on limited quotas for more sophisticated products. Argentina is counting on the good relationship between its president, Mauricio Macri, and Mr. Trump.""In the conversations that we have on the issue, the positive relationships between our governments -- and our presidents -- certainly comes up,"" Miguel Braun, Argentina's trade secretary, said in an interview.But it's unclear whether the confidence is justified. The White House has not confirmed that Australia, Brazil or Argentina will receive exemptions.In terms of the potential disruption to the global economy, the dispute with Europe may be the most critical. The United States and the European Union account for about one-third of world trade.Only a few years ago the United States and Europe were discussing the possibility of eliminating almost all trans-Atlantic trade barriers. Now they are stymied by fundamentally different worldviews. As the Europeans see it, Mr. Trump is demanding concessions that would make them accomplices in dismantling a postwar trade framework they hold sacred.The Europeans want to play by the rules of the World Trade Organization; the Americans are making demands that would force the Europeans to break them.""If we stick to the rules,"" said Thiess Petersen, an analyst at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, ""there is no chance for concessions.""German cars, a particular target of presidential ire, are one of the major sticking points.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been handling talks with the European Union, has been pushing the 28-nation bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported American cars as one way of cutting its trade surplus with the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, said that the United States wanted more concessions before it granted a permanent exclusion.But if the European Union accepted the demand for lower car tariffs, international treaties would require it to apply similar terms to automobiles from all other members of the World Trade Organization.The biggest beneficiary might be China. A member of the W.T.O., China is keen to become an auto exporter and would be thrilled to get easier access to Europe without giving up anything in return.The Europeans are offended that they are being asked to negotiate in the first place. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said last week that the union would discuss terms of trade with the United States only after it had received a permanent and unconditional exemption to the steel and aluminum tariffs.""When that is confirmed by the president,"" Ms. Malmstrom told reporters in Strasbourg, France, ""we are willing as always to discuss anything. But we are not negotiating anything under threat.""In an extension of the disconnect between the two NATO allies, the president has expressed annoyance that he can't just bypass the European Union apparatus altogether and work out deals with favored leaders like Mr. Macron. That approach would be illegal under the E.U. treaty and undermine one of the bloc's fundamental principles -- that all the members act in unison on trade matters.""I would rather deal just with France,"" Mr. Trump said at the White House on April 24, ahead of a visit by Mr. Macron. ""The Union is very tough for us. They have trade barriers that are unacceptable.""David O'Sullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that if tariffs go into effect, ""we are back to the need to pursue this with the World Trade Organization, including the possibility of imposing rebalancing counter-tariffs on equivalent U.S. exports.""The E.U. has already drawn up a list of products targeted for retaliation. They are meant to inflict maximum pain on the Republican heartland, including recreational power boats made in Tennessee, digital flight recorders made in Arizona and playing cards made in Kentucky.But the strategy may not be effective. Business leaders who have visited Washington recently said that the president had been unmoved by protests from members of his own party.Together, the countries seeking to extend temporary exemptions account for about half of American steel imports. The United States has already granted South Korea a permanent exemption as part of  a revised trade deal.Other countries have already been denied exemptions and started paying tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. They include China and Russia as well as Japan, a close ally.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan refused to be coerced into one-on-one negotiations, instead trying to coax the United States back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Mr. Trump left last year.""Our country's position is that T.P.P is best for both of the countries, and based on that position we will be approaching the talks,"" Mr. Abe said in mid-April.Mr. Trump was not persuaded. After briefly considering rejoining the trade agreement, he reversed course, writing on Twitter that the deal had ""too many contingencies.""For Canada and Mexico, among the largest exporters of steel and aluminum to the United States, the Trump administration has tied their exemptions to Nafta talks. Negotiators from the three countries are scheduled to meet again on May 7 as they push to work through the major remaining disagreements and announce a revised pact.The direct impact of the tariffs on world trade, assuming they take effect, will be minimal, economists say. Though steel plays a big role in the public imagination, it accounts for a sliver of global commerce.Economists are more worried that a trade war will escalate. Many of the effects will be difficult to predict.""When two elephants fight,"" said Miguel Ponce, head of Argentina's Center for the Study of Foreign Trade in the 21st Century, ""it is the grass that suffers the most.""Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Credit: JACK EWING and ANA SWANSON; Jack Ewing reported from Berlin, and Ana Swanson from Washington.

740,1688365274.xml,"       BRUSSELS -- A chorus of voices on Monday called on European Union authorities to plan for Greece to default on its huge pile of debt after bailout talks between Athens and its creditors deteriorated over the weekend. But while European leaders dialed up the sense of urgency, they did little to offer a way to break the deadlock. They instead put the onus on the government in Athens to prevent Greece from becoming the first to quit the eurozone in what would be a major setback to the nearly seven-decade project to unify the Continent. Some senior politicians and policy makers from Germany were among the most outspoken, with one warning of the need for a ""state of emergency"" to handle the potential fallout from a failure to reach a deal with the Greek government. The impasse over the debt talks exposed the wide gap between Greece and its creditors -- other eurozone countries, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The two sides are deadlocked over what steps Greece must take to overhaul its economy, particularly regarding its pension system and tax systems. Unless they work out a deal, the creditors will not unlock aid payments from Athens's recently extended international bailout, raising the likelihood that Greece willbe forced to impose capital controls and default on its loans. That would prompt a new bout of speculation about the long-term viability of the 19-nation currency bloc. All parties have repeatedly found ways to delay a reckoning in the long-running Greek debt crisis. But the current round of posturing and brinkmanship is expected to escalate toward the end of June, when the bailout extension expires and Greece has to come up with a repayment of 1.6 billion euros, or $1.8 billion, to the International Monetary Fund. The sides were hardening their positions in advance of Thursday's meeting of euro area finance ministers, whose approval is required for any resolution to take effect. European markets also slumped on Monday; Greece's stock market fell sharply, closing about 4.7 percent lower, as interest rates on European government bonds rose. Weekend discussions between senior Greek government officials and representatives of creditor groups broke down Sunday evening, as the two sides refused to soften their long-held bargaining positions. But Gavriil Sakellaridis, a spokesman for the Greek government, said on Monday that for Athens the ""only plan, basic plan, is to reach a deal."" He said that ""efforts will continue for a mutually beneficial agreement."" Mr. Sakellaridis repeated, however, that Greece would not cut pensions or raise the valued-added tax on basic goods, steps that, according to the government, the creditors have insisted Athens must take to release the bailout funds. Asked whether Greece would submit new ideas to creditors, he said that the government had ""to a great extent reached its limit on proposals."" President François Hollande of France warned on Monday that failure to reach a deal on Greece could lead to ""a period of turbulence."" Speaking at a news conference at the International Paris Air Show, Mr. Hollande said that he would tell the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, ""Let's not waste time. Let's resume negotiations as soon as possible."" One of the main issues hanging over the negotiations is the continuing flight of capital from the Greek banking system. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Monday that his institution would continue providing emergency funding to Greek banks as long as they remained healthy. Mr. Draghi, speaking before a European Parliament committee in Brussels, said that any loosening of the rules on the lenders' holdings of short-term debt -- a primary source of the fragile Greek government's funding -- hinged on the ""credible"" prospect of a deal with creditors. ""The ball lies firmly in the camp of the Greek authorities,"" Mr. Draghi added. ""Urgent action is necessary."" Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, echoed that sentiment and warned of the increasing danger that Greece would have to declare bankruptcy. ""Time is running out. The likelihood that no solution can be found is growing day by day,"" he told a conference in Frankfurt on Monday. ""There seems to be a lack of will to reach agreement,"" he said. Mr. Weidmann argued for something more than a stopgap solution so that ""Greece can stand on its own two legs"" without continually turning to partners for help. > This is just the latest battle of wills in the crisis that has prompted speculation that Greece is in imminent danger of abandoning the euro. Four years ago, after months of arduous negotiations and large anti-austerity rallies in Athens, lenders agreed to reduce interest rates paid by Greece for its loans; the following spring, private creditors had their loans restructured. A standoff late last year, when lenders said Greece had failed to fulfill its loan conditions, prompted political upheaval and led to snap general elections. The results brought the left-wing Syriza party to power and finally led to an interim agreement with the creditors in February that extended the European part of the bailout program by four months. Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for digital affairs, who is close to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, called on the European Commission to make plans for a ""state of emergency"" in Greece from July 1. The commission helps oversee Greece's compliance with the terms of its loans. Mr. Oettinger was among several leaders of Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats who met for a regular party leadership session on Monday at which Greece was the foremost topic. There were also cautionary words for Greece from Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the center-left Social Democrats, who are Ms. Merkel's partners in government. In what amounted to the strongest warning yet from his party to the leftist government in Athens, Mr. Gabriel told Bild, Germany's top-selling newspaper, ""We want to help Greece and keep them in the euro,"" but ""it is not only time that is running out, but everywhere in Europe the patience."" Mr. Gabriel also expressed sympathy for ordinary Greeks, ""who so urgently need this help from Europe."" But, he emphasized, ""Europe and Germany will not be blackmailed. And we will not let German workers and their families pay for the exaggerated election promises of a partly communist government."" The Athens government sought to underline that the debt crisis was as much a problem for Europe as for the Greek people -- and indicated that it was prepared to bet that its creditors would blink first. ""We will patiently wait for the institutions to adhere to realism,"" Mr. Tsipras said, referring to Greece's creditors. ""Those who perceive our sincere wish for a solution and our attempts to bridge the differences as a sign of weakness, should consider the following: We are not simply shouldering a history laden with struggles,"" Mr. Tsipras said. ""We are shouldering the dignity of our people, as well as the hopes of the people of Europe."" Greek newspapers criticized European creditors for making too many demands that risked unleashing economic chaos, but some also suggested that the Athens government was mismanaging the latest chapter of the debt drama. ""A scenario of rupture, the road opens to default,"" the right-wing Eleftheros Typos said. ""Callous creditors, awkward government,"" the center-left Ta Nea said. The European Commission said at a daily briefing in Brussels on Monday that there were no scheduled meetings between Greece and its creditors before a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Thursday in Luxembourg. But the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, was expected to meet with Mr. Draghi to discuss the talks.

3042,433410016.xml,"      Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief and Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, said Saturday that they would continue last-ditch negotiations on Sunday in Vienna to see how far Iran would go to meet United Nations Security Council demand that it freeze its uranium-enrichment program or risk sanctions. Christina Gallach, Mr. Solana's spokeswoman, told reporters that the three hours of talks on Saturday had been ''positive and constructive.'' Mr. Larijani said, ''We had some good and constructive talks, we made some progress in some areas, and we shall continue tomorrow.'' Diplomatic pressure on Iran to halt its enrichment of uranium has increased in recent weeks. Iran says its nuclear program is designed to generate electricity, but the United States and Europe suspect the program is meant to develop nuclear weapons. R. Nicholas Burns, the American under secretary of state for political affairs, said Friday in Berlin that the United States hoped to begin talks next week to fashion a resolution that would seek sanctions against Iran if it did not halt its enrichment of uranium. Mr. Burns was speaking after extensive talks with the other four permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, France, China, Britain -- as well as with Germany. Talks were held separately with Canada, Italy and Japan. He said the talks with the Europeans, Russia and China would continue Monday and would focus on the possibility of drawing up a draft on sanctions before the General Assembly convened the following week. But Russia and China have made it clear that they will oppose sanctions, and on Saturday, the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jaibao, warned against stepping up pressure on Iran. ''To mount pressure or to take sanctions will not necessarily bring about a peaceful solution,'' he told a news conference in Helsinki, Finland, after a meeting with European Union officials. He added that resolving the nuclear dispute peacefully would take time. Mr. Wen will start a two-day official visit to Germany on Wednesday, and is expected to discuss Iran with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Before arriving in Vienna, Mr. Solana said he did not want United Nations sanctions to be imposed on Iran ''as long as meetings with Mr. Larijani continue.''  Britain, France and Germany circulated a letter to other European capitals on Thursday warning that Iran was intent on ''splitting the international community'' and playing for time by declining to answer in detail a package of economic and political incentives that American, European, Russian and Chinese negotiators presented it in July.

1614,1434339821.xml,"       BAD HOMBURG, Germany --  Europe has barely been mentioned in the German election campaign. But in the final days before Sunday's vote, a fringe party that wants to scrap the euro is gaining in the polls, threatening to scramble the country's consensus politics with a message that has echoes of the Tea Party in America and rightist movements elsewhere in Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are expected to emerge victorious from the elections. But polls are giving the upstart party, Alternative for Germany, a decent chance of winning seats in Parliament for the first time. Its surprising strength could have an outsize effect on the shape of the next German government and help determine how far it can go in satisfying the desire among its European Union partners for more forceful steps to end the Continent's economic crisis. A small but committed minority of Germans see the party as the only alternative to mainstream parties too timid to admit that the euro has failed. And the party has offered a home to more socially conservative Germans who are unhappy with the way Ms. Merkel has pushed the conservative bloc to the center on social issues like gay rights. In recent days, there has been a sense of euphoria among Alternative for Germany's supporters about its chances of winning a share of power. ""I am convinced they will get into the Bundestag,"" said Ingrid Cook, 63, who lives in Bad Pyrmont, in northwestern Germany, and translates technical manuals for a machinery company. Mrs. Cook said Friday that she had been handing out leaflets and working at party information stands in her area. ""I have grandchildren, and I want to be able to tell them I saw the catastrophe coming and tried to do something about it,"" she said by telephone. Alternative for Germany is poised to drain votes from Ms. Merkel's party and its junior partner in government, the Free Democratic Party -- enough, perhaps, to prevent the Free Democrats from reaching the 5 percent of the national vote needed to return to Parliament. Such a result would leave Ms. Merkel no alternative but an awkward coalition with her main opponents, the center-left Social Democrats. While Alternative for Germany would be too small to have much sway over policy, it could be a loud and disruptive voice in debates about measures to prevent the collapse of the euro, offering a rightist challenge to the determined centrism Ms. Merkel has pursued in her eight years as chancellor. As it has gained in strength, the party has been trying to move beyond a fixation with abolishing the common currency and attract social conservatives by talking about issues like family policy and tax reform. ""In the past few weeks, the party has understood the need to expand beyond their image as a single-issue party and position themselves as an alternative for people who are socially conservative and no longer feel the Christian Democratic Union represents them,"" said Oskar Niedermayer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. Alternative for Germany is decidedly a work in progress, attracting an eclectic group of supporters who seem to be united only by their conviction that the mainstream parties are not discussing the issues important to them. It remains to be seen whether the party can become a lasting force in German politics, in the same way that the Green Party emerged from the environmental movement in the 1980s, or whether, like so many other issue-driven parties in the past, it will self-destruct amid squabbles over doctrine and leadership posts. The party's contradictions were on view at a forum it sponsored Thursday evening in Bad Homburg, a wealthy suburb of Frankfurt. One man in the audience stood up to urge the party to take a stand against same-sex marriage. Konrad Adam, one of the party's leaders, conceded that it had no official stance on the issue. ""We don't have a position on every question,"" Mr. Adam said, speaking from the stage of a community center. Another man rose to say Germans should get extra votes for each child they have, as a way of rewarding people who are helping to stave off population decline. Mr. Adam, a 71-year-old former political reporter, said he thought that was a good idea, while again cautioning that the party had no official position. In a country that has had public health care since the 19th century, the party's rejection of government, however, is selective. Many of the party's supporters in Bad Homburg said they thought the government should offer more financial support for families, like larger pensions for women who have forgone careers to raise their children. The party also has some features in common with the U.K. Independence Party, whose glib, pint-quaffing leader, Nigel Farage, is shaking up British politics with a demand that Britain leave the European Union. Though Alternative for Germany professes to be in favor of a united Europe, there is a deep strain of mistrust toward what supporters see as remote bureaucrats in Brussels. Its members tend to see the euro as an extension of the Eurocrats' power. ""Things were better for everybody when we had the Deutsche mark,"" said Antje Wegner, a retired nurse in Bad Pyrmont. The party has had to fend off accusations that its message has attracted supporters from the extreme right. A younger man at the gathering in Bad Homburg on Thursday night complained that German social policies were encouraging the ""wrong families"" to have children, an apparent reference to non-Germans. Others in the audience objected to that statement, however. Party leaders like to draw parallels with the Green Party, which grew from a protest party to become a fixture of German politics, with a large delegation in Parliament and leadership of a coalition government in Baden-Württemberg, one of the most prosperous states. But there is also a danger that Alternative for Germany could suffer the same fate as the Pirates, whose main issue is Internet freedom. The Pirates shocked the political establishment by gaining almost 9 percent of the vote in Berlin state elections in 2011, but they have since faded and are seen as having no chance of winning seats in Parliament on Sunday. For now, Alternative for Germany is focused on maximizing votes and not being too choosy about who joins. Some supporters have even come from a defunct Stalinist party, Mr. Adam said on the sidelines of the event in Bad Homburg. ""Anyone who respects the Constitution is welcome,"" he said. ""Why not?""

1414,1020715385.xml,"      IT is difficult to envision an American parallel to Syriza, the far-left political coalition that has a chance to throw Europe into further turmoil with a victory in this weekend's Greek elections. But imagine a movement that combines elements from Occupy Wall Street and Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential campaign, and you have a sense of where Greece's leading opposition party would fit in the American political spectrum.   The party's full name translates as Coalition of the Radical Left, which sounds like something that Glenn Beck might have scrawled on his blackboard during the health care debates of 2009 but actually describes the party's supporters pretty accurately. Syriza is led by a former member of Greece's Communist Party, and its constituents range from socialists to Trotskyists to groups with beyond-parody names like the Renewing Communist Ecological Left.    Greece is more hospitable to radical politics than the United States, but when Syriza was founded in 2004, it was strictly marginal. It took 3.3 percent of the vote in Greece's legislative elections that year, while the country's mainstream center-right and center-left parties won 86 percent of the vote between them.   But that was before the financial crash knocked over Greece's fiscal house of cards and made its entry in the European Union's common currency look like one of recent history's gravest blunders. Today the Greek unemployment rate is 22 percent, the youth unemployment rate is over 50 percent, and the country has no political mainstream anymore. In last month's legislative elections, the center-right party took 19 percent of the vote, the collapsing center-left party took 13 percent -- and sandwiched in between them was Syriza, with as strong a claim to legitimacy as either.   This weekend Greece is voting again, and the Coalition of the Radical Left has a chance to improve on that performance. If it does, and its leadership finds a way to form a coalition government, Syriza has promised to cancel the austerity program that the euro zone effectively imposed on Athens in exchange for loans and bailouts. In doing so, its leaders would be daring the E.U. to push Greece out of the currency union -- and the E.U. might have no choice then but to shove.    The elite consensus is that this would represent economic suicide for the Greeks, as well as a potential disaster for Europe as a whole. (And not only Europe: rest assured that the Obama White House, too, is praying that Syriza underperforms.)    This consensus is probably correct, and probably persuasive enough to prevent the Greek electorate from delivering the country into the hands of the far left. But there are two realities that explain why so many Greek voters find Syriza attractive.   First, recent experience has given ordinary Europeans no reason to trust elite predictions about anything. The entire E.U. project was hailed as a self-evident good by a generation's worth of statesmen and intellectuals, and Euroskepticism was confined in many countries to the fringes of the left and right. Now those fringes have been vindicated, and all the statesmen and intellectuals stand exposed.    Yes, a Greece that had never joined the euro wouldn't have prospered as much during the fat years of the 2000s. But as in the United States, much of that growth has turned out to be illusory. And when a system the entire European establishment promised would deliver prosperity and stability delivers political paralysis and 20 percent unemployment, it becomes hard to convince voters that they have much to lose by listening to extremists and radicals instead.   Second, countries that vote to stay the course now may find that they lose their right to vote at all in the future. The answer to the current crisis, every eurocrat agrees, is further integration: In the words of Germany's Angela Merkel, ""not just a currency union,"" but also ""a so-called fiscal union, more common budget policies ... [and] above all a political union.""    But as The Times's Floyd Norris noted on Friday, a recent speech by the head of the German Bundesbank suggests that such a union would feature a central authority empowered to bypass national governments whenever they turned uncooperative on budget policy. This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations.   There are worse political arrangements, certainly, than the old Hapsburg model. But that doesn't mean that voters in Greece (or Italy, or Spain ...) should be expected to quietly acquiesce to it.   This is the irony of Europe's current predicament. From the point of view of Berlin and Brussels, the only way to save the euro zone is to gradually take power away from voters on the grounds that they can't be trusted not to vote for radicals like Syriza.    But from the point of view of patriotic Greeks, it's precisely the threat of losing their sovereignty that might justify a vote for Syriza in the first place.      ",2012-06-17
2872,1856083313.xml,"       PARIS -- The German director Maren Ade's breakout film, ""Toni Erdmann,"" has won over audiences and racked up awards across Europe. An uncharacterizable father-daughter story that's also about neoliberal economic reforms in Romania and the clash between the generation of 1968 and its capitalist children, the film is exceptional for another reason: It's hilarious. Germany has generally not been known for exporting comedies -- and, to outsiders, has a perhaps undeserved reputation for humorlessness -- but ""Toni Erdmann,"" which has been sold around the world, upends that. ""I said to my producer, 'I'm sorry, this will not be a comedy, this will be a very long and sad film,""' Ms. Ade said in a recent interview. ""But we were very happy that the comic aspect came out while editing."" The film, which opened recently in New York, has been loved by critics since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It won no prizes there but recently made the shortlist for the foreign-language Academy Award, has been nominated for a Golden Globe, and won every top prize at the European Film Awards. (The New York Times's chief film critics, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, included it in their year's best lists.) It tells the story of Ines (Sandra Hüller), a stressed-out, workaholic German management consultant posted to Bucharest, who receives an unexpected visit from her father, Winfried (Peter Simonischek), a music teacher and practical joker who eventually assumes the persona of ""Toni Erdmann,"" a life coach, and deploys a wig, fake teeth and whoopee cushions in a complex subterfuge to bring Ines back to her old self. In Germany, where ""Toni Erdmann"" has been a box-office success for an art-house film, Ms. Ade (pronounced ah-DAY), 40, is seen as an outlier whose sui generis vision doesn't fit into any established comic traditions. She herself has said that her inspirations include the American comic Andy Kaufman, as well as the Hollywood films of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder, and the Berlin theater troupe Gob Squad. ""In Germany, mainstream comedies are rather vulgar,"" said Katja Nicodemus, the film critic at Die Zeit, a German weekly. ""Maren Ade, for me, is closer to Wilder and Lubitsch than to contemporary German comedy because she's closer to that deep humanism -- the masquerades, the salaciousness, the wit, the social critique of those comedies, in a subconscious way."" ""For me, what makes the film so exceptional is that it's a tragedy, where in this tragedy the father plays the comedy,"" Ms. Nicodemus added. While most German comedies tend toward cabaret-style slapstick humor, ""Toni Erdmann,"" which is 162 minutes long, makes use of repetition and time, drawing out awkward moments to the point of comic discomfort. The film's kooky humor stands in contrast to Germany's top box office hit of the year, ""Welcome to the Hartmanns,"" a mainstream comedy about a wealthy Bavarian family adopting a Nigerian refugee -- touching on a hot-button issue in Germany, where an influx of migrants has been testing society and the political establishment. Written and directed by Simon Verhoeven, that film has received mixed reviews (as well as criticism for posters that omitted Eric Kabongo, who plays the Nigerian), but it has also been praised for pulling off a complex feat. Mr. Verhoeven ""undertakes something that is very rarely achieved in German cinema,"" Wolfgang Höbel wrote in Der Spiegel. ""He treats as uproarious entertainment a political and social conflict that has split the country into two somewhat irreconcilable camps: the joiners-in, and those who are enemies of Angela Merkel's 'We can do this' slogan,"" Mr. Höbel added, referring to the statement by Ms. Merkel, the German chancellor, that Germany could handle the refugees. In an interview, Mr. Verhoeven agreed that his film was critical of Ms. Merkel. ""It definitely is, because I am critical of her,"" he said, ""not so much because I'm critical of the basic direction that she led the country in, but I was in so many refugee homes, I saw how much people were struggling and how many people tried to help refugees, but there wasn't a master plan. There wasn't a vision of how it's going to work."" ""Welcome to the Hartmanns"" has not received distribution overseas yet, and it's rare for a German comedy to find international success. Those that have include Tom Tykwer's 1999 hit, ""Run, Lola, Run,"" which isn't, strictly speaking, a comedy; Sandra Nettelbeck's 2002 romantic comedy, ""Mostly Martha,"" which was later remade by Hollywood with Catherine Zeta Jones; and Wolfgang Becker's 2004 ""Good Bye, Lenin!"" Ms. Ade is the first director in what has been called the Berlin School -- a loose affiliation including Christian Petzold and other filmmakers who came of age in the 1990s and make closely observed dramas -- to delve into comedy. One of the great comic moments in ""Toni Erdmann"" is a party scene in which Ines, on the spur of the moment, transforms a ""team building"" brunch into what she calls ""a naked party"" -- stripping off her clothes and telling her guests, including her boss, to get naked, too. ""Standing in a bright room naked is really the worst thing that can happen to you,"" Ms. Ade said. ""That was really courageous. I had a feeling the character is at a point where it's almost physically not possible for her to put on her clothes and go into that role again."" She added: ""This nakedness doesn't lower her status. She discovers while doing this that it raises her status; it makes her independent again."" While ""Welcome to the Hartmanns"" directly tackles a tough contemporary issue, ""Toni Erdmann"" is also slyly political, about the differences between those in Winfried's generation, who came of age in the '60s and rebelled against parents from the Nazi era, and those of Ines's generation, who grew up in a post-Cold War capitalistic society. ""They're very political; they raised their children with a lot of human values,"" Ms. Ade said of Winfried's generation. ""He wanted her to be free, self-determined. They believe in a world without borders. Then he's confronted with things turned into the opposite."" In using comedy, the film takes a new approach to German history. ""The big myth in German cinema is that you have to wear a Nazi uniform to talk about the past, and it's more complicated,"" said Ms. Nicodemus, the Die Zeit film critic. ""Toni"" also represents a change from the German films that normally appear on the international festival circuit: works by directors from the 1968 generation, including Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. ""When the international film community thinks about German films, there are these old big '68 moviemaker heroes, and they stand for a certain seriousness and dealing with historic issues in Germany,"" said Tobias Kniebe, the chief film critic at Süddeutsche Zeitung, a daily in Munich. Ms. Ade's film ""kind of broke a mold,"" Mr. Kniebe added. ""To be able to make this kind of movie with that kind of complexity and accuracy and still get the big laughs and be the toast of Cannes, and sell it to more than 100 countries, that's kind of like saying now, if you're German, you can do anything. It's up to you, there's no prejudice anymore."" Credit: RACHEL DONADIO; Christopher D. Shea contributed reporting from London.

1904,1859383637.xml,"       Many people in the United States and abroad have consoled themselves by assuming that Donald Trump's outrageous statements were just politically driven, and he'd temper them once he became president. That thinking seems more wishful than ever when the man chosen to lead the world's most powerful country keeps saying that two pillars of postwar security and prosperity -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union -- are obsolete. Mr. Trump's latest salvo against stalwart American allies came in  a joint interview over the weekend with The Times of London and Bild, a German newspaper. His published remarks have angered and shaken America's closest allies in Europe. Mr. Trump said NATO was obsolete because it had failed to resist terrorism, and he repeated earlier charges that some of its members were not paying their fair share. He described the European Union as ""basically a vehicle for Germany"" and predicted that other European nations would probably follow Britain's lead by leaving it. Then came potshots at Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, a strong leader who is facing a tough re-election. He called her brave decision to open Germany's borders to migrants and refugees a ""very catastrophic mistake."" He also suggested that he saw no difference between Ms. Merkel and Vladimir Putin, saying he would, at least initially, trust them equally, even though it was the Russian president who meddled with the American election, bombed civilians in Syria, crushed dissent in his own country and invaded Ukraine. It is puzzling indeed for a president-elect to publicly denigrate leaders of his country's closest allies as well as an alliance that for 70 years has stood firm against Russian expansion. And Mr. Trump's criticism of NATO's response to terrorism showed no awareness of the alliance's contributions to the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Mr. Trump did say during the interview that ""NATO is very important to me,"" but in the context of his other remarks, this was hardly enough to blunt the impression that he placed little value on NATO's historic role as a defender of democracy and its continued usefulness today. Nor did Mr. Trump's remarks ease concerns that his choices for cabinet members, some of whom seem to have a much firmer grasp of foreign policy than he does, will have little if any influence on administration policy. During their recent confirmation hearings, Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, said he saw value in durable alliances; retired Gen. James Mattis, the defense secretary designate, went even further, asserting that ""if we did not have NATO today, we would need to create it."" Mr. Trump's comments on the European Union almost took the breath away: ""I don't think it matters much for the United States."" The union has its problems, as Britain's vote to leave it has shown, but to cavalierly dismiss as unimportant the idea of European integration and the second-largest market in the world is to ignore history and reject the future. Mr. Trump seems eager to help unravel the rules-based international order. The big winner in all this is Mr. Putin, who has been working assiduously not just to delegitimize American democracy by interfering with the election but to destabilize Europe and weaken if not destroy NATO, which he blames for the Soviet Union's collapse. Mr. Putin will almost certainly try to persuade Mr. Trump to withdraw American support for NATO's plans to reinforce its defenses against a newly assertive Russia. As part of that effort, an American convoy crossed into Poland last week; on Monday, the deployment of 330 American Marines  to Norway began. Reversing course any time soon would be a huge mistake. European leaders put on a brave face after the Trump interview. ""The best response is European unity,"" Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of France said. A worthy response, but incomplete. The Europeans also need America as a partner. America needs Europe as well.

3683,2014097912.xml,"PARIS -- Europe is pushing for more stringent vetting of foreign investments, with an eye on Beijing. Australia has been blocking bids by Chinese buyers for strategic assets. And in Canada, a Chinese takeover of a major contractor faces a national security test.As China looks to spread its wealth and influence, the United States is not the only country seeking to shield its industries under the guise of national security. Governments around the world, and especially in Europe, are increasingly inclined to use such concerns as a litmus test for Chinese investments to protect their competitive edge.It's a mixture of political posturing, national pride and outright paranoia. But China presents a difficult policy puzzle. Countries must balance safeguarding their strategic industries and preventing the loss of sensitive technologies, while still courting Chinese investors and improving trade with Beijing.""There's a general impression that China is rising on all fronts, and the question is how to deal with that,"" said Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""Most countries don't know how to react.""The United States appears to be taking the hardest line toward China. President Trump's decision this week to block a hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom for the rival American chip company Qualcomm fell apart over concerns that a takeover could hand Chinese rivals an advantage. And the panel that reviewed the Qualcomm deal, known as Cfius, is likely to get tougher still on China.The committee, which can essentially block foreign acquisitions of American firms on national security grounds, has already quashed a number of deals by Chinese-linked buyers. Lawmakers are now calling to broaden the types of transactions the panel can vet.Europe got off to a later start. A protectionist debate ramped up last year when Germany, France and Italy called for a Europe-wide mechanism for more rigorous vetting of foreign takeovers. The move came amid rising worries about the loss of the region's edge in technology, and the transfer of so-called dual-use technologies to China.Concerns mounted after the 2016 purchase  of Kuka, Germany's biggest and most advanced maker of robotics, by a Chinese company. And they have intensified as China has invested in railways, ports and other strategic infrastructure across southern and Central Europe.Some of the reaction reflects domestic political concerns. Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, said on a visit to Beijing in January, for example, that Paris would welcome investment from China, but only after screening deals to ensure French assets were not ""looted.""Still, numerous governments are pressing to harden reviews of foreign investment as China embarks on a major push to transform its economy to a cutting-edge superpower, an ambitious policy known as Made in China 2025.The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed in September creating a Europe-wide framework to screen investment deals by foreign companies. And last year, the German Parliament passed a law allowing deals to be scrutinized on national security grounds if an investor's stake reaches 25 percent.But the political push to tighten up on Beijing faces considerable hurdles.For one thing, the risks of angering China are real. Despite the optics, European companies remain eager for Chinese investments. And European governments are also wary of offending Beijing at a time when they are pressing to get better access to Chinese customers.Even within Germany there is no unity among political leaders. Angela Merkel, recently sworn in for a fourth term as chancellor, has cultivated ties with Beijing, and China has become a crucial market for companies like Volkswagen, a German behemoth and Europe's biggest automaker.Europe is also divided over how to cope with China's rise. Greece, Hungary and other poorer southern and Central European countries that benefited from China's largess during the financial crisis have generally opposed tightening scrutiny for fear of discouraging further Chinese investment.As a result, Mr. Juncker has sought to walk a fine line in his proposal to screen investment deals, which is seen as the first step toward an E.U.-wide mechanism similar to Cfius.It's a reason critics say the plan lacks real teeth. It would mainly require European Union member states to inform Brussels of foreign investment deals, especially ones that might affect the security of another country. Currently, only 12 of the European Union's 28 member states have any screening mechanism in place.""It will be difficult for the E.U. to have a strong institutionalized mechanism for foreign direct investment any time soon,"" said Jue Wang, an associate fellow in the Asia Pacific Program at Chatham House, a research organization in London. ""European companies will still want to welcome Chinese money.""The proposal also appears to be weaker than what other major economic powers have in place. Japan recently strengthened restrictions on foreign investments related to security. And Britain this week strengthened government powers to scrutinize foreign investment in specific areas of the economy through the lens of national security, with China in mind.Nor would the European Union's plan necessarily catch innovative new strategies by Chinese investors to take stakes in strategic assets.Germany was caught off guard after one of China's wealthiest men last month amassed a $9 billion stake in Daimler, a crown jewel of Germany's auto industry. Li Shufu, the chairman of the Chinese car giant Geely, made the grab through a financial maneuver before anyone even realized what was happening. Last year, the German company rejected a proposal by the Chinese businessman to take stakes in the company.The stealth purchase over months made Mr. Li the largest shareholder in Daimler. The German authorities are examining whether the purchase adhered to German investment laws. But it is unlikely that either Daimler or the German government can do anything about the acquisition.The experience of other countries shows the complexity of the situation.In Australia, where Chinese foreign investment reached more than $30 billion in 2014 alone, the government has sought to toughen screening.Wariness of Beijing's growing economic influence has increased as Chinese investors buy up vast swaths of the Australian economy and over concerns about Chinese businessmen giving millions of dollars to Australian politicians. Chinese takeovers of Australian businesses have jumped in recent years, along with an acceleration in purchases of agricultural land.In 2015, the government strengthened foreign acquisitions and takeover rules to require the approval of a national oversight board if, for instance, a foreign purchaser's portfolio of farmland was worth $15 million or more. It has also blocked bids by a Chinese firms for Australian electricity companies, citing such deals as contrary to the national interest.More changes could be afoot. The government recently said it would consider updating its foreign investment guidelines so Australians could be sure that proposed investments were ""good for the country.""Elsewhere, while the government of Prime Minster Justin Trudeau has been courting Chinese investors, public sentiment in Canada has not always aligned with that effort. Some attempted takeovers of Canadian companies by Chinese investors were abandoned because of concerns over national security and Chinese business practices. Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker, dropped ambitions to acquire BlackBerry, a smartphone used widely in government agencies, after Ottawa signaled a deal could compromise national security.Those concerns prompted Canada's previous Conservative government to strengthen foreign investment laws to require stakes taken by non-Canadian entities to pass a national security test.The government is now reviewing a proposed takeover of Aecon, a major Canadian contractor, by Chinese state-backed CCCC International Holding. Officials are assessing whether national security would be undermined by the takeover of Aecon, which handles major infrastructure projects and has done work for Canada's military and nuclear industry.""We welcome international investments that will benefit the Canadian economy,"" said Karl W. Sasseville, a spokesman for Navdeep Bains, the minister for economic development, whose department handles investment reviews, ""but not at the expense of national security.""Credit: LIZ ALDERMAN; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, Jacqueline Williams from Sydney and Ian Austen from Ottawa.Follow Liz Alderman on Twitter: @LizAldermanNYT.Li Shufu, left, one of China's wealthiest men, caused alarm after he quietly amassed a $9 billion stake in Germany's Daimler.

2138,433837017.xml,"      NATO leaders agreed Thursday to endorse a United States missile defense system based in Europe and to provide more troops for Afghanistan, but they refused to back President Bush's proposal to bring Ukraine and Georgia closer to NATO membership.   Washington's failure to win over Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other crucial European countries to its view on Ukraine and Georgia was considered by some countries of Central and Eastern Europe to have sent a message of alliance weakness to Moscow, a day before the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, makes his first visit to a NATO summit meeting.   But Mr. Bush could claim success in persuading NATO to endorse his missile-defense plan in the face of Russian objections, and on Thursday signed an agreement with the Czech Republic to build radar for the system.    ""There has been, over 10 years, a real debate as to whether there is a ballistic missile threat,"" said Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley. ""And I think that debate ended today."" Mr. Bush also succeeded in getting NATO to agree to increase troop numbers in Afghanistan, a Washington priority.   Mr. Putin has objected strongly to building parts of the missile defense system in former Soviet bloc states, despite Washington's assurances that the system is a response to threats from Iran, not from Russia. Mr. Putin, saying the system would fuel a new arms race, has even threatened to aim Russian missiles at the system, while also offering the use of a substitute system in Azerbaijan.   NATO's final statement invited Russia to cooperate with the United States and Europe on developing defenses jointly.   Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian Parliament, said that missile defense would be high on the agenda for the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin in Sochi, a Russian resort, scheduled after the NATO conference, which Mr. Putin is to attend Friday.   Mr. Kosachev said Russia doubted Washington's motives. ""We still do not have a proper explanation of this project,"" he said. ""It is not about the number of interceptors. It's about undermining mutual confidence and trust.""   The main contributor to more troops in Afghanistan was France. President Nicolas Sarkozy said Paris would send another battalion -- some 700 troops -- to eastern Afghanistan, freeing up more American soldiers to deploy in support of Canadian forces in the south, where the fighting against the Taliban is heaviest.   Mr. Sarkozy, in a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, repeated that France intended to reintegrate fully into NATO once a separate European defense pillar became a reality. ""Let Europe's defense pole advance, and we will continue to advance toward NATO,"" he said. ""I repeat, these are two things that go together, not one or the other, so let's wait for the summit"" in 2009, he said.   He praised Mr. Bush for comments ""on the need for European defenses that would complement the alliance, which was, in my opinion, a historic turning point in U.S. policy,"" Mr. Sarkozy said. ""It was a gesture we have been waiting for, that has been noticed. It's a gesture that shows understanding for what is happening in Europe.""   A senior American official said Mr. Bush praised Mr. Sarkozy, too, saying his trip to the United States last fall had an impact ""like the latest incarnation of Elvis.""   Mr. Bush traveled to Ukraine on the eve of the summit meeting here and strongly endorsed its eventual membership. But the alliance decided not to offer Ukraine and Georgia entry into its Membership Action Plan, or MAP, a set of requirements and reforms necessary to achieving full alliance membership.    It was a remarkable rejection of American policy in an alliance normally dominated by Washington, and it sent a confusing signal to Russia, one that some countries considered close to appeasement of Moscow.   American officials focused on NATO's agreement that the alliance's foreign ministers would reconsider Ukraine and Georgia when they met again in December, before President Bush left office, though few Europeans expected a different result. The Europeans suggested that invitations to the MAP might come in a year, at the next summit meeting, to be jointly held by Germany and France, or in 2010.   Mr. Hadley, the national security adviser, said that most of the former Communist states that had joined NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union had supported the American position. He and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized NATO's final statement declaring that Georgia and Ukraine would become members someday, as would any other aspiring democracy in Europe.    German and British officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, criticized the Bush administration for not coming to grips soon enough with the Ukraine and Georgia problem. They suggested that Mr. Bush's failure to try to work through the issue with Russia in advance created doubts among crucial allies like Germany and France, who also felt that Georgia's leadership was unstable and that Ukraine, with a divided population and a new government, was not yet ready to enter the MAP.   Boris I. Tarasyuk, a former Ukrainian foreign minister and close ally of President Viktor A. Yushchenko on NATO membership, said in an interview: ""Moscow will be very satisfied with the outcome. But I'd like to say to them that this is not the end of the story. Sooner or later it will happen.""   Georgia's foreign minister, David Bakradze, said a ""no"" for Georgia would validate ""those people in the Kremlin who think that by a policy of blackmail, by arrogance and aggression"" they can influence NATO's decisions.   NATO did extend full invitations to join the alliance to two significant countries of the Western Balkans, Croatia and Albania. But in an embarrassment for NATO, which runs by consensus, Greece insisted on vetoing the membership invitation of tiny Macedonia. Athens insists that the country must have a name different from Greece's northern province to avoid any sense of territorial claim and ""instability,"" objections that NATO officials regard as ludicrous.    ""This is a huge disappointment,"" said the Macedonian government's negotiator, Nikola Dimitrov. ""It goes against the values that stand behind NATO. It's very much against stability in the Balkans.""   Mr. Bush, addressing his NATO colleagues, praised changes that Macedonia had put in place and said that the ""name issue needs to be resolved quickly, so that Macedonia can be welcomed into NATO as soon as possible.""   He did not mention Greece. Nor did Mr. Bush mention Ukraine and Georgia.    Credit: STEVEN ERLANGER and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting.

52,1555491813.xml,"       RIGA, Latvia --  History has bequeathed this Baltic port capital much beauty, captured in elegant Art Nouveau buildings or the Gothic church steeples that stud the windswept skyline. But it has also left a nasty ethnic rift that has persisted despite Latvia's absorption into NATO, the European Union and the euro currency, and which has now deepened with the crisis in Ukraine. In this nation of two million, about one-third of the residents speak only or primarily Russian. Many -- but not all -- are people whose families arrived during the decades of Soviet rule here. Ever since Latvia declared independence in 1991, many of these Russian speakers have been in limbo, as noncitizens squeezed out of political life, largely unable to vote, hold office or even serve in the fire brigade. Those who refuse to acquire proficient skill speaking Latvian do not get citizenship. In the coming October elections, unless the government decides to issue special voting cards, about 283,000 will, once again, not cast ballots. This weekend the Baltic nations marked 25 years since the Baltic Way, a seminal event in the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when two million of their citizens linked hands across nearly 400 miles to declare their goal of independence. Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians ""took each other by the hand back then to show the world that they wanted to be free, independent states,"" noted Laimdota Straujuma, the prime minister of Latvia, at a ceremony here on Saturday. It was ""a shout of three abandoned nations for freedom,"" said her Estonian counterpart, Taavi Roivas.  But while the Baltic majorities remember with relish their successful bid for freedom, others who live in the three lands recall the end of the Soviet Union as a misfortune, or worse. As an ethnic Russian member of Latvia's Parliament, Boriss Cilevics feels the daily crosscurrents created by the rift which, he stressed, is ""not a problem of blood."" About 25 percent of marriages are mixed Latvian-Russian, he noted. ""We work together, and spend time together."" Russian is widely heard, and Russian citizens make up about a third of the tourists who visit the country. But the dominant political consensus, Mr. Cilevics said, holds that ""an absolute majority of ethnic Latvians must be ruled by ethnic Latvians only."" Mr. Cilevics is a member of Harmony Centre, a political party often supported by Russians that has regularly cleared the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into the 100-seat Parliament but has never been included in Latvia's coalition governments. The government has one ethnically Russian minister -- Vjaceslavs Dombrovskis, in charge of the economy. Riga's telegenic blond mayor, Nils Ushakovs, is the Russian leader of Harmony Centre and has won election twice in the city of 700,000, by far Latvia's largest. In October, he is making a bid for prime minister, though he is considered unlikely to succeed. Latvian politicians who defend the status quo portray it as the natural outcome of the Soviet period, when the ethnic Latvian population here dwindled dangerously close to 50 percent after deportations of Latvians to Siberia before and after Nazi occupation, and an influx arrived from other parts of the Soviet Union. In 1991, citizenship was automatically granted to those who had held citizenship before 1940 -- the start of Soviet occupation -- and their descendants, including many who fled abroad in the chaos during and after World War II. Those non-Latvians who had arrived in Soviet times, and their descendants, had to prove they knew the language and history. ""If the major goal is for everybody to become a citizen, you have to have some kind of attachment to the values,"" said Artis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister here who now sits in the European Parliament. Today, Mr. Pabriks asked, noting President Vladimir V. Putin's annexation of Crimea and interference in eastern Ukraine, if Russian speakers ""are sharing values with Putin, how can they be citizens of Latvia?"" Mr. Pabriks, who wrote his doctorate on minorities in Europe, noted that the number of Latvian residents without citizenship had dropped dramatically, to 12 percent from 36 percent in the early 1990s. By comparison, he said, 9 percent of German residents are not citizens. That is beside the point for ethnic Russians living in Latvia like Lyudmila, 56, a flower seller and mother of six who declined to give her last name. ""I was born here, but I'm not a citizen. I studied Russian, and you have to go and get that naturalization. I am not going to beg,"" she said. ""I do feel at home here, but there is some kind of process of differentiation, and it is offensive."" The Ukraine crisis has made matters worse, Mr. Cilevics of the Latvian Parliament argued, because most Latvians rely on media in their own language, which give very different views of the conflict. Broadly speaking, the Latvian media is more supportive of Ukraine's tug away from Russia while Russian-language media echoes, though more mildly, the Kremlin line. Exceptionally, Mr. Cilevics said, ""I am one of those people who have two ears,"" absorbing Russian media, but also subscribing to reports from European monitors in Ukraine, and finding ""the truth is somewhere in between."" It reminds him of Soviet times, he said, reading the Communist daily Pravda, then listening to Radio Liberty, which is financed by the United States. But most people, he noted, ""only have one ear."" Mr. Ushakovs, the mayor, added that many Latvians ""still have some concerns about Russians, because of the very complicated history in the past."" Thousands of Latvians who survived mass Soviet deportations are still alive, for example. Conversely, Russians here ""are not happy when they see fellow Russians burned to death in Odessa,"" he said, referring to the deaths of some 40 people in violence in the Ukrainian port in May. The divide, Mr. Pabriks stressed, ""is not an ethnic issue. It is political."" Seeing Ukraine pulling out of Russia's orbit reminds Russian speakers of how Latvia did the same as the Soviet Union collapsed. They have ""a feeling of humiliation that the Soviet Union was dissolved. This is about perception of the world. They think, 'Who are you, you small countries? You have no greatness.' This is how they feel and this is why they don't want to integrate."" On the other hand, as Mr. Ushakovs put it, summing up the sentiments of more than a dozen conversations, ""no one wants Ukraine here."" That nightmare, he argued, could not repeat in Latvia or the other small Baltic States, which are suddenly feeling vulnerable to Russian aggression, agricultural sanctions on produce from the European Union and Mr. Putin's threats to protect Russian minorities outside Russia. Latvia and its neighbors, Lithuania and Estonia, which have smaller Russian minorities, have always been stable, with per capita gross domestic product in Latvia four times higher than Ukraine, the mayor said. Mr. Pabriks, the former minister, estimated that approximately 60 percent of Russians in Latvia are sympathetic to Mr. Putin, and his cultivation of Soviet glory. ""On the other hand, even 99 percent of the supporters of Putin in Latvia, I don't think they are ready to do more than talk."" Russia could make its influence felt in other ways. Latvia depends 100 percent on Russia for deliveries of natural gas. Although the country gets about one-third of its electricity from hydropower, and has shifted toward renewable energy, it is clearly vulnerable to pressure from Russia's Gazprom, which has a large stake in Latvijas Gas, the natural gas company. Reinis Aboltins, a researcher at the nongovernmental Providus Institute, cited a parliamentary vote last March postponing until 2017 what was supposed to be a mandatory diversification of the gas supply network as one example of Russia's bringing pressure to bear. Yet dependence is to some extent mutual: Gazprom, which has never cut off delivery to the Baltics, also relies on part of the Latvian network to supply gas back into northwest Russia, including St. Petersburg. For centuries, Russia and Germany have wielded influence here. Riga was an imperial port in czarist times. Russians have been a large minority here for more than 200 years. Today, as visitors drive in from the airport, the first commercial office is that of Siemens, the German engineering giant. The first gas station belongs to Russia's Lukoil. But now Latvia's foreign ties are no longer a symbol of dominance by another nation. When Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited last week, making clear that NATO will support the Baltic States but not permanently station troops so close to Russia's borders, crowds of a few hundred cheered her at two different locations. Most were tourists, ""not just from Germany but from all over Europe,"" the chancellor noted later. ""That shows,"" she said, ""just how much Latvia has simply become also a part of our common European space."" A Medieval Castle in Cesis.

1009,1806556405.xml,"       LONDON -- Nearly every day seems to bring a new horror to the streets of Western Europe, leaving innocent men, women and children dead or broken, fueling political and social tensions and creating what some are already calling the summer of anxiety. Death and injury have been dealt out by truck, ax, handgun, machete and bomb. The victims have included families out for a night of fireworks on the glittering French Riviera, teenagers hanging out at a McDonald's, tourists on a train and pop music fans at a Sunday night concert. Three of five attackers in less than two weeks professed loyalty to the Islamic State, but none appear to have been directed by the radical group, and all of the assaults seemed to blur the line between ideological terrorism and violence driven by anger, grudge or mental instability. That very murkiness -- the absence of a centrally organized plot or a singular villain to blame -- has made it all the more difficult for France, Germany and the rest of Europe to know how to respond. The lack of straightforward answers has made things trickier at a time of political flux in Europe. Even before the latest string of attacks, the Continent was seeing a rise in nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment, and far-right parties were using the atmosphere to try to gain new legitimacy and power. Populist, anti-immigration sentiment was a powerful factor in Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union. The recent surge in high-profile violence has only given further opportunities to those who advocate taking a tougher line on immigration by Muslims, in many ways echoing the platform being promoted by Donald J. Trump in his presidential campaign in the United States. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary spoke highly of Mr. Trump, saying the Republican nominee's proposals for fighting terrorism were just what Europe needs. In France, which displayed remarkable unity after two terrorist attacks in 2015, there has been growing political infighting and finger-pointing since the July 14 attack in Nice that killed 84 people. In Germany, the latest attacks have further strained ties between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party and its ally in the southern state of Bavaria, where there has long been simmering opposition to her decision last year to admit one million asylum seekers. Concern about the security and social ramifications of a new surge in migrants coming to Europe from Syria, Afghanistan and other poor and war-torn countries has left the European Union with reduced leverage in dealing with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey as he cracks down on opponents in the wake of a failed coup this month. Mr. Erdogan had agreed to a deal with the European Union to hold back the tide of asylum seekers, a deal that Europe is deeply reluctant to endanger, especially with new security concerns attached to the migrants. The same sorts of attacks have occurred elsewhere, including last month in Florida. But the concentration of attacks over less than two weeks in Europe has given the issue particular resonance on the Continent. Finding answers is in part a familiar security and intelligence challenge. But it is also in some cases a problem of immigration, assimilation and tolerance. And it is a reminder of the lure of the burst of fame, or infamy, available to troubled, violence-prone people in an age of social media and instant global communication. ""If you turn every individual into a self-contained agent, some will take unpleasant initiatives and act out their fantasies in real time, but they still feel the need for an anchoring identity,"" said François Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. For some, he said, that is jihad. ""It can happen in Orlando and Nice,"" he said, ""and without a lot of prior consultation or structure or networking."" Ali Sonboly, the 18-year-old who killed nine people in Munich on Friday, may have been Iranian-German, but he took his inspiration in part from Anders Behring Breivik's massacre five years ago in Oslo, Norway, which was driven by the hatred of a white supremacist. Mr. Sonboly ""wanted to make his mark as an individual"" by hacking into Facebook to entice people to McDonald's, ""the intertwining of complete barbarity and utter modernism,"" Mr. Heisbourg said. Mr. Sonboly was acting not as a state or an organization but as an individual, and individual actors are extremely hard for security services to stop. Yet their individual acts, captured on smartphones and sent around the world, can resonate louder than any gunshot or explosion. The attack in Nice, France, was carried out by a Tunisian-born man with a rented truck. It has set off a new battle over blame and added another volatile element to the early stages of a presidential campaign where the governing Socialists, led by President François Hollande, are falling further behind the right and far-right. The fierce and open debates over security and accountability are a sharp contrast to the reaction in France to last year's attacks, when there was an effort to create a sense of political and national solidarity in the face of terrorism. There is vivid anger at what appears to be the inability of the government to keep people safe. The local government in Nice, which leans right, issued a blunt broadside against the Socialist government and specifically the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, for failing to have adequate security in place on Bastille Day. Mr. Cazeneuve was also accused of pressuring the local government to massage the numbers to make it appear that there were more safety provisions in place. Mr. Cazeneuve called the allegations part of a ""vile"" and ""calumnious"" campaign to defame him and his ministry, but his job may be on the line. In Germany, three of the four recent attacks have been carried out by recent immigrants, two of them Syrian, and all of them Muslims. Three of the four were in Bavaria, which was the first reception center for more than a million migrants last year seeking asylum, and where the governing Christian Socialists have been an early and persistent opponent to Ms. Merkel's open-door policy, despite their close alignment to her Christian Democrats. With elections next year, Ms. Merkel remains largely popular. But the attacks by migrants -- however disturbed or unbalanced the attackers may have been -- added to the continuing ramifications of the sexual assault allegations against migrants on New Year's Eve in Cologne, have raised the risk of increased anti-Muslim prejudice and increased doubts about the efficiency of the police and security services. The German far-right party, Alternative for Germany, has been divided, but this spate of attacks could help the party, which under a new leader, Frauke Petry, has shifted to emphasize issues like opposition to Islam and immigration. With seats in eight state parliaments, the party is expected to gain seats in the Bundestag, or national parliament, next year. The national political reactions are playing out against a backdrop of global change in which terrorism is only one element. ""The world has been changing and we see that manifested in many ways, with new power centers, the power of the individual and the corporation, the disenfranchised finding a new voice and a sense that the governing infrastructure is no longer fit for purpose in today's world,"" said Xenia Wickett of Chatham House, a London foreign-policy research institution. Institutions, she said, are struggling to deal with new challenges from Islam, inequality, terrorism and globalization. ""We're trying to manage that change and people don't like change,"" she said. ""That's the new normal, and it makes us very anxious until we can find a new one.""

4144,433702895.xml,"      The Supreme Court exerts leadership over the nation's justice system, not just through its rulings, but also by its choice of cases -- the ones it agrees to hear and the ones it declines. On Tuesday, it led in exactly the wrong direction. Somehow, the court could not muster the four votes needed to grant review in the case of an innocent German citizen of Lebanese descent who was kidnapped, detained and tortured in a secret overseas prison as part of the Bush administration's morally, physically and legally abusive anti-terrorism program. The victim, Khaled el-Masri, was denied justice by lower federal courts, which dismissed his civil suit in a reflexive bow to a flimsy government claim that allowing the case to go forward would put national security secrets at risk.   Those rulings, Mr. Masri's lawyers correctly argued, represented a major distortion of the state secrets doctrine, a rule created by the federal courts that was originally intended to shield specific evidence in a lawsuit filed against the government. It was never designed to dictate dismissal of an entire case before any evidence is produced. It may well be that one or more justices sensitive to the breathtaking violation of Mr. Masri's rights, and the evident breaking of American law, refrained from voting to accept his case as a matter of strategy. They may have feared a majority ruling by the Roberts court approving the dangerously expansive view of executive authority inherent in the Bush team's habitual invocation of the state secrets privilege. In that case, the justices at least could have commented, or offered a dissent, as has happened when the court abdicated its responsibility to hear at least two other recent cases involving national security issues of this kind. Mr. Masri says he was picked up while vacationing in Macedonia in late 2003 and flown to a squalid prison in Afghanistan. He says he was questioned there about ties to terrorist groups and was beaten by his captors, some of whom were Americans. At the end of May 2004, Mr. Masri was released in a remote part of Albania without having been charged with a crime. Investigations in Europe and news reports in this country have supported his version of events, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged privately to her that Mr. Masri's abduction was a mistake, an admission that aides to Ms. Rice have denied. The Masri case, in other words, is being actively discussed all over the world. The only place it cannot be discussed, it seems, is in a United States courtroom. In effect, the Supreme Court has granted the government immunity for subjecting Mr. Masri to ''extraordinary rendition,'' the morally and legally unsupportable United States practice of transporting foreign nationals to be interrogated in other countries known to use torture and lacking basic legal protections. It's hard to imagine what, at this point, needs to be kept secret, other than the ways in which the administration behaved irresponsibly, and quite possibly illegally, in the Masri case. And Mr. Masri is not the only innocent man kidnapped by American agents and subjected to abuse and torture in a foreign country. He's just the only one whose lawsuit got this far. This unsatisfactory outcome gives rise to new worries about the current Supreme Court's resolve to perform its crucial oversight role -- particularly with other cases related to terrorism in the pipeline and last week's disclosure of secret 2005 Justice Department memos authorizing the use of inhumane interrogation methods that just about everyone except the Bush White House thinks of as torture. Instead of a rejection, the Masri case should have occasioned a frank revisiting of the Supreme Court's 1953 ruling in United States v. Reynolds. That case enshrined the state secrets doctrine that this administration has repeatedly relied upon to avoid judicial scrutiny of its lawless actions. Indeed, the Reynolds case itself is an object lesson in why courts need to apply a healthy degree of skepticism to state secrets claims. The court denied the widows of three civilians, who had died in the crash of a military aircraft, access to the official accident report, blindly accepting the government's assertion that sharing the report would hurt national security. When the documents finally became public just a few years ago, it became clear that the government had lied. The papers contained information embarrassing to the government but nothing to warrant top secret treatment or denying American citizens honest adjudication of their lawsuit. In refusing to consider Mr. Masri's appeal, the Supreme Court has left an innocent person without any remedy for his wrongful imprisonment and torture. It has damaged America's standing in the world and established the nation as Supreme Enabler of the Bush administration's efforts to avoid accountability for its actions. These are not accomplishments to be proud of.  ",2007-10-11

In an undated image provided by Enrico Nawrath/Bayreuther Festspiele, the soprano Asmik Grigorian makes her Bayreuth debut as Senta. With neither ship nor sea, Dmitri Tcherniakov’s new Bayreuth Festival staging recasts the opera as a tale of violent revenge. (Enrico Nawrath/Bayreuther Festspiele via The New York Times)


BAYREUTH, Germany — The pilgrims to the Green Hill, who have been making their way to the storied festival Richard Wagner founded here 145 years ago, looked more like cattle on Sunday. The theater’s bucolic grounds had become a network of roped-off, one-way sidewalks and checkpoints.
With stricter pandemic safety measures than many other European opera houses, the Bayreuth Festival’s opening night — a new production of “Der Fliegende Holländer” (“The Flying Dutchman”) — lacked some of its usual glamour. Indeed, the romance ended at the sight of mobile bathrooms outside the theater; the ones inside had been deemed too risky. The audience was limited to 900, less than half the house’s capacity.
Yet the unpleasantness of these restrictions faded as the lights dimmed, the hall resounded with the stormy opening of “Holländer,” and the Bayreuth experience began to work its usual magic.
And what a sound it was: The orchestra, propulsive and spirited from the start, was led by Oksana Lyniv, the first female conductor in the festival’s history. Much has rightly been made of that milestone, however embarrassingly overdue.
Lyniv’s “Holländer” was occasionally a little brash, but it was always both driven by and driving the drama, with sharp attention to detail and pacing — in a work whose repetitive score can easily sag under a less assured baton.
She wasn’t the only newcomer at the festival this summer: Dmitri Tcherniakov, virtually unavoidable at European houses in recent years, was directing his first Bayreuth production. And Asmik Grigorian, a steel-voiced soprano and one of the finest acting talents in opera, was making her debut here as Senta — a performance met with a roaring ovation.
There was polite applause for Grigorian’s colleagues, as well; the audience seemed ready to warmly greet whatever they saw after Bayreuth was canceled last year. But although there were some elements of normalcy on Sunday — Chancellor Angela Merkel was even back in her usual box — the festival was still far from its former self.
The full forces of Bayreuth’s fabled chorus, for example, were not allowed onstage. Instead they were divided: half singing in the theater, complemented by an ensemble of lip-syncing actors, and half broadcast from a separate hall. The effect was at times acoustically disorienting.
As a director, Tcherniakov is often interested in trauma: the ways in which it is overcome, sublimated or succumbed to. Here, that was manifest in the Dutchman’s origin story, recounted in a series of vignettes during the overture.
The Dutchman, in this telling, grew up in a small town — possibly coastal, though there is neither a ship nor sea in sight — with uniform, clean, monochromatic, rather sinister architecture. His single mother had an affair with a married man, who violently broke things off with her. Gossip spread, and she became an outcast, isolated in an already isolating place. So she hanged herself; the boy, unable to help, was left mournfully holding onto her swinging foot.
He leaves his hometown and later returns — like the libretto’s cursed Dutchman, docking his ship every seven years in search of a love that will redeem him. Now an adult, with an imposing build and furrowed brow, he is unrecognizable at a local bar, where he tells his tale to a half-interested crowd. (The baritone John Lundgren’s delivery of the monologue was strained, and misaligned with the menacing force of his demeanor.)
Among the people the Dutchman meets at the bar is Daland — in the libretto a sea captain and the father of the opera’s heroine, Senta, but here a clean-cut, middle-class man. (Indeed, the one who ruined his mother’s life.) The bass Georg Zeppenfeld portrays him with a warm tone and a touch of naïve insouciance.
The cityscape shifts between scenes, its buildings fluidly rearranging into new configurations. At the beginning of Act II, they create a plazalike space for the “Spinning Chorus,” led by Mary, Senta’s nurse (though in Tcherniakov’s staging presented as her mother and played, often silently, by Marina Prudenskaya with weary exasperation).
This scene introduces Grigorian’s Senta, a young woman with Billie Eilish hair and a defiant streak. She sings her Ballad — which recounts the Dutchman legend, with an emphasis on his redemption by a woman who will be faithful to him until death — with dramatic gesticulations and a sense of ironic overstatement. But later, when she is alone onstage and her theme returns, Grigorian delivers the tune with quiet, sincere longing, perhaps seeing in the Dutchman a kindred spirit.
She and the Dutchman meet over an awkward dinner at her house, separated by her parents and seated at opposite ends of the table, which is laid out slowly and fussily. It’s not exactly a meet-cute, but something clicks, and the parents fade to invisibility as Senta and the Dutchman sing what came off on Sunday as a mismatched duet, Grigorian luxuriously lyrical and Lundgren a little thin. (Eric Cutler, who sang the role of Erik, the Dutchman’s rival for Senta’s affections, similarly struggled to rise to her level.)
Act III opens like most any “Holländer” production, with the town’s women bringing the men food — only here they gather to enjoy it together. Off to the side, though, is a group of sullen men whose dark clothing contrasts with the earth tones of the locals. Traditionally, they would be the Dutchman’s ghostly crew, and they provide one strategic use of the broadcast choir. As their lines are played through speakers, the men onstage remain threateningly silent.
They are, it becomes apparent, willing collaborators in the Dutchman’s plot to exact deadly revenge on the town. After Erik confronts Senta about their now-broken promises to each other, a fight breaks out in which the Dutchman coolly shoots someone while the crowd retreats back into the town — which the mysterious men have set on fire.
As smoke fills the space and the Dutchman violently casts Senta aside — just as her father once did to his mother — Mary enters with a shotgun, aims it directly at the Dutchman’s chest and pulls the trigger. It’s a lot of violence in not a lot of time, and it wasn’t easy to follow on opening night.
But one thing was clear. Even though this production, as it had been described in advance press, is focused on the psychology and background of the Dutchman, the redemptive power of Senta was inescapable. Rather than join him in an act of eternal devotion, she takes the gun from her shaking mother and holds her, bringing a sense of calm as the curtain comes down.
So while Tcherniakov might have been most interested in the psyche of an angry and vengeful man, the only character who truly changes — and, indeed, matures — in his staging is Senta. Especially with Grigorian onstage, it’s very much her opera.

3925,2564363549.xml,"The State Department is frantically trying to track down U.S. citizens. Tens of thousands of Afghan allies will all but certainly be left behind.WASHINGTON -- At least 1,500 American citizens remain in Afghanistan with just days left before the scheduled U.S. withdrawal from the country, but officials on Wednesday acknowledged the reality that tens of thousands of Afghan allies and others at high risk of Taliban reprisals would be left behind.The sound of gunfire, and clouds of tear gas and black smoke, filled the air around the international airport in Kabul, the capital, as thousands of Afghans massed at the gates on Wednesday, desperate to escape ahead of the American military's final departure on Aug. 31, after 20 years of war.The U.S. Embassy warned Americans later in the day to stay away from the airport and told anyone outside the perimeter to ""leave immediately."" The British and Australian governments issued similar warnings.A senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential assessments, confirmed that the United States was tracking a ""specific"" and ""credible"" threat at the airport from the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, which has carried out dozens of attacks in recent years and is a rival of the Taliban.As military and government charter flights took off every 45 minutes as part of an airlift, Biden administration officials said they had evacuated about 82,300 people since Aug. 14, the day before Kabul fell to the Taliban. Around 4,500 of them were American citizens, with 500 more expected to depart soon.But Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the government was trying to track down around 1,000 American citizens still believed to be in Afghanistan who had not responded to a frantic flurry of emails, phone calls or other messages offering to evacuate them.""In this critical stretch, we're focused on getting Americans and their families onto planes, out of Afghanistan, as quickly as possible,"" Mr. Blinken said at the State Department.He also sought to assure Afghans who had worked with the U.S. military or embassy, and potentially hundreds of thousands of people who challenged the Taliban's extremist ideology, that ""they will not be forgotten.""Likening images and reports of Afghans being trampled at the Kabul airport in the crush to evacuate to ""getting punched in the gut,"" Mr. Blinken said it would be incumbent on the Taliban to guarantee their safe passage.He signaled that such an arrangement could be reached with a mix of economic and diplomatic pressure, and the lure of international aid, but he would not discuss his level of confidence in the Taliban to keep their word beyond vaguely citing what he called their public and private commitments to allow people to leave.""Let me be crystal clear about this: There is no deadline on our work to help any remaining American citizens who decide they want to leave to do so, along with the many Afghans who have stood by us over these many years, and want to leave, and have been unable to do so,"" Mr. Blinken said. ""That effort will continue every day past Aug. 31.""A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said on Wednesday that Afghans with valid travel documents would not be prevented from entering the airport if they were allowed in by American and Afghan forces there.In his first sit-down interview with a Western media organization since the Taliban's arrival in Kabul, Mr. Mujahid disputed reports that the group would begin to keep Afghans away from the airport, which had been based on his statements during a news conference a day earlier.""We said that people who don't have proper documents aren't allowed to go,"" he said. ""They need passports and visas for the countries they're going to, and then they can leave by air. If their documents are valid, then we're not going to ask what they were doing before.""He also insisted that the Taliban would forgive those who fought against them, and that women would be allowed to attend school and work, within what he described as Islamic principles. Human rights officials have dismissed such assurances as disingenuous, and many Afghans have hidden in their homes, fearing harassment and violence.Mr. Mujahid acknowledged that women would need a male guardian on journeys of three days or longer. He said that rumors that the Taliban would force women to stay in their homes or cover their faces were baseless, but he confirmed that music would not be allowed in public.""Music is forbidden in Islam,"" he said, ""but we're hoping that we can persuade people not to do such things.""White House officials said on Wednesday that 90 U.S. and allied planes had flown out an estimated 19,200 people in a 24-hour period.At least 500 were American citizens and their families, Mr. Blinken said, joining Afghans who were employees of the now-shuttered U.S. Embassy in Kabul and others who had worked for the American military and other government agencies, some since 2001, who qualify for a special immigration visa to live in the United States.Congressional officials said earlier this week that the Biden administration had identified an estimated 50,000 Afghans who were eligible for the special visa. Former security forces, government officials and people who advocated women's rights, the rule of law and other pillars of democracy also have been evacuated.A new estimate from the Association of Wartime Allies released on Wednesday concluded that at least 250,000 Afghans -- and perhaps more than a million -- could be eligible for expedited immigration status. The advocacy group worked with American University to analyze employment contracts and other documents that those Afghans would need to prove their eligibility.Mr. Blinken could not offer a more precise number, and noted the difficulty that even tracking down how many Americans might be in Afghanistan had been a challenge for the U.S. government.He said the State Department had identified at least 6,000 Americans -- many of them with dual Afghan citizenship -- by searching various databases. Officials have sent more than 20,000 emails and placed 45,000 phone calls across Afghanistan to offer U.S. citizens a chance to leave, he said.Thousands more American citizens may live in Afghanistan, but had not registered with the U.S. Embassy and otherwise could not be found, a senior State Department official later acknowledged.Hours before Mr. Blinken spoke, lawmakers in Congress urged the Biden administration to extend the Aug. 31 deadline to ensure that all Americans and Afghan allies could leave Afghanistan safely.""The reporting I'm getting on the ground are that our American citizens are trying to get out,"" said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Our Afghan partners and interpreters who served with our special forces, put their life on the line. We have a moral obligation to save them.""Mr. Blinken would not discuss whether any semblance of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul -- once one of the largest American diplomatic missions in the world -- would remain open after the military exits next week. A small group of U.S. diplomats remain in Afghanistan, on a secure base at the airport in Kabul, to oversee the evacuation and continue negotiations with the Taliban.As the evacuation mission played out, world leaders -- and millions of Afghans -- waited with anxiety to discern the true shape of Taliban rule.During the group's last turn in power, Afghan women risked being beaten, tortured or executed if they left their homes. In the two decades since American-led forces ousted the militants from power, many young women have come to expect basic rights.In the first days after the Taliban seized Kabul, and national power, on Aug. 15, Afghan protesters have demanded that the militants accept their demands for greater freedom. Among the protests was a march by women demanding that their right to education and jobs not be harmed.One activist, named Fariha, said she had taken part in the demonstration last week ""to show the Taliban that they have to change, because we will not.""""We cannot breathe if we are deprived of our rights to education and work, and if we are not present in the society,"" she said through sobs.""There are women who haven't gone to Europe or the U.S. -- they have stayed and are ready to fight until death,"" she said. ""We have worked hard for 20 years to gain education and work. We will not let anyone ignore us.""Despite Taliban efforts to reassure Afghans of their safety, ominous signs suggest that they have not abandoned their brutal tactics. On Tuesday, the United Nations' top human rights official cited ""harrowing and credible"" reports that the Taliban had executed civilians and noncombatant soldiers.With the future of international aid to Afghanistan unclear, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Wednesday that her country would maintain its support for the Afghan people after the U.S. troop withdrawal. She also called for talks with the Taliban.""Our goal must be to preserve as much as possible what we have achieved in terms of changes in Afghanistan in the last 20 years,"" Ms. Merkel told a session of Parliament convened to discuss the Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan. ""This is something the international community must talk about with the Taliban.""Germany pulled its last contingent of about 570 troops out of Afghanistan in June, but several hundred Germans were still engaged in development work funded by their government.Adding to the concerns about Afghanistan is its foundering economy, which had been propped up for the past generation by American aid, but is now in free fall. Banks are closed. Cash is growing scarce, and food prices are rising. Fuel is becoming harder to find. Government services have stalled as civil servants avoid work, fearing retribution.People trying to flee, if they make it past Taliban checkpoints, have been met with chaotic scenes at Kabul's airport. At least seven Afghan civilians, including a toddler, have been trampled to death.On Wednesday, the Taliban brought what looked like about 200 people to a fenced-off area, where they were crammed together under a beating afternoon sun.John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday that American officers in Kabul, including Rear Adm. Peter G. Vasely, the top commander, and Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue, the head of the 82nd Airborne Division, were talking to their Taliban counterparts every day to ensure safe passage of Americans and Afghan allies with proper credentials to flights leaving Kabul.Mr. Kirby said that the Pentagon would prioritize the evacuation of American troops and equipment in the mission's final days. About 5,400 American troops are now at the airport after 400 troops not essential to the evacuation left the country in recent days, he said.Still, there have been numerous reports of Afghans with proper paperwork being turned away at Taliban checkpoints and even at the airport gates, where some 30 U.S. consular officials and Marines are checking credentials. Throughout the past week, many gates have closed intermittently to clear backlogs.Lara Jakes reported from Washington, and Michael Levenson from New York.

622,1890955272.xml,"A member of the European monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine was killed and two others were injured Sunday when their vehicle drove over a mine near Luhansk. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which runs the monitoring mission, said it was investigating.The monitor who was killed was an American man, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Austria, which holds the rotating presidency of the 57-nation organization. The man's name was not released.
The mission has had more than 700 unarmed civilian monitors deployed in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Their role now is to keep track of whether government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the region are complying with a 2015 cease-fire agreement, including commitments to withdraw heavy weapons.
The organization confirmed that the episode involved a patrol of six monitors in two armored vehicles.
The Austrian Foreign Ministry said one of the two people injured was a German woman. Alexander Hug, the principal deputy chief of the monitoring mission, told reporters that the other person injured was from the Czech Republic. No other details about the person were immediately available.
Mr. Hug noted that all sides in the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine had made binding commitments to remove all of their mines and other explosive devices. ""Sadly, particularly for our mission today, and for all civilians in the area, the commitments remain true only on paper,"" he said.
Tensions remain high in the region, where most people speak Russian rather than Ukrainian and armed militias seized government buildings and unilaterally declared independence after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia in 2014. The 2015 cease-fire is violated regularly.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Sunday she was appalled at the episode, and said her government expected both sides to investigate and determine who was responsible.
""The conflict parties must also finally implement the long-agreed cease-fire,"" Ms. Merkel said in a statement. ""And there, the Russia-supported separatists who are illegally and violently occupying parts of Ukrainian territory bear a particular responsibility.""
The Russian Foreign Ministry said the circumstances suggested that the episode was probably meant to undermine the peace process. It called for an impartial investigation.
""We're deeply outraged by this cynical action, which led to the loss of human life and was directed against international observers who work for the sake of peace,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website.
The Ukrainian military said the patrol hit the mine at 10:17 a.m. near the small village of Pryshyb, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and the Austrian foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, also called for an investigation.
A spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said further information would be released as it became available. The organization, whose members include Ukraine, Russia and the United States, voted in March to extend the monitoring mission in Ukraine for another year.
Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, said Sunday that the monitors' work was ""indispensable"" and that their patrols had clearly prevented more serious military escalation in the region.

1125,872419099.xml,"      Europe's finance ministers unexpectedly put off approval early Monday of the next installment of aid to debt-laden Greece, delaying the decision until July and demanding that the Greek Parliament first approve spending cuts and financial reforms that include a large-scale privatization program.    After nearly seven hours of talks in Luxembourg, ministers announced a holding action that reflected their struggle over how to avert a potentially disastrous default by Greece. Athens needs the next payout of 12 billion euros from its existing 110 billion euro bailout package by mid-July in order to remain solvent.    The decision adds to pressure on the Greek government and its prime minister, George Papandreou, who on Sunday began urging Parliament to support his reform plans in a confidence vote scheduled for Tuesday night.    The ministers' action fell short of expectations raised Thursday when Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said in a statement that he was confident the leaders would reach agreement in Luxembourg to provide Greece the next installment of aid in early July.   Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who leads the group of 17 euro zone finance ministers, said he expected the disbursal to be approved if deep spending cuts and new reform measures were enacted. ""I cannot imagine for one second that we would commit to finance Greece without knowing that the Greek Parliament has given a vote of confidence to the Greek government,"" he said.   Mr. Papandreou's Socialist Party has been working to shore up its tenuous political position in the face of widespread anger in Greece over strict austerity measures that have produced job losses and cuts to wages and pensions. Late last week Mr. Papandreou shuffled his cabinet and appointed a Socialist stalwart, Evangelos Venizelos, as the new finance minister.    The ministers did fall into line with an agreement made on Friday between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, over the extent to which private investors would be involved in a second bailout package, which Greece needs on top of its existing rescue package in order to meet its debt obligations through next year.    The ministers did agree that a second bailout would involve the private sector ""in the form of informal and voluntary rollovers of existing Greek debt"" -- a solution deemed acceptable by the European Central Bank. Before backing down on Friday, Mrs. Merkel had initially pressed for debt swaps instead.   Asked about the mood of the talks, the Belgian finance minister, Didier Reynders, said ""the atmosphere was good.""   ""The problem was that we have to make progress on the role of the private sector, and we have made progress,"" he said.   The discussion proved more complex than expected because the International Monetary Fund was insisting that the European Union effectively underwrite the Greek government if its financing plan did not add up over the next year, said one European official not authorized to speak publicly. Many governments resisted that effort because of the uncertainty in knowing how much of a financing gap there could be next year. It is also unclear what proportion of it could be covered by the private sector.   Devising a new bailout that would include voluntary private sector involvement, so it would not be classified as a default, will be complex, said one official not authorized to speak publicly, because the amount that the private sector agrees to contribute will largely determine how big a gap reluctant European governments will have to fill. Another big source will be Greece's privatization program, intended to raise as much as 50 billion euros.    After a week of intense turmoil that ended with an overhaul of the ruling Socialist Party's cabinet on Friday, Mr. Papandreou signaled on Sunday that he was prepared to make radical changes to the indebted Greek state system, and proposed an overhaul of the Constitution.    Declaring that the bloated government sector was largely to blame for the state of the Greek economy, Mr. Papandreou called for a referendum in the fall on a proposal to ""change the political system"" and revise the Constitution, which protects some 800,000 government workers.    Mr. Papandreou confirmed that talks were progressing between Greece and its foreign creditors for a second bailout package ""approximately equal"" to last year's emergency loan package of 110 billion euros.    The stakes still remain high, with politicians aware of the risk of contagion.    ""Nobody's lending to the Greeks at the moment and that's why we need to find a solution,"" said Maria Fekter, Austria's finance minister. ""A default would be an ever bigger damage.""    All this comes a little more than a year after the international community offered the government in Athens its first package of 110 billion euros in loans to prevent it from having to borrow at crippling rates on the financial markets.    But Greece has since then failed to meet its economic goals because of a worse-than-expected recession, which has depressed revenues, as well as its own failure to install reforms.    Greece's creditors have demanded that Mr. Papandreou secure a broad political consensus on a number of austerity measures -- chiefly tax increases, cuts in public spending and privatization of state assets -- that are to be voted on in Parliament by the end of this month.

2047,433673606.xml,"              Carter Dougherty reported from Berlin and Edmund L. Andrews from Washington. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Tuesday that a high savings rate among oil-producing nations and Asian countries continued to help depress interest rates by keeping financial markets flush with cash. But Mr. Bernanke warned against banking on the steady flow of cheap money -- which helped stoke overly lax mortgage lending and the recently punctured housing bubble -- over the long term.   Speaking in Berlin at a conference sponsored by Germany's central bank, Mr. Bernanke conspicuously avoided the topics that have fixated investors lately: the turmoil in credit markets, the risk of an American recession or the Fed's readiness to lower interest rates at its policy meeting next week. Instead, he gave an almost academic discourse about global trade imbalances and his theory that a ''global savings glut,'' concentrated in the world's poorer countries, had helped keep interest rates low and contributed to the United States' high rate of foreign indebtedness. It was not clear whether the Fed chairman wanted to project a sense of calm ahead of the rate-setting meeting or whether he wanted to avoid sending any false signals on a decision over which Fed officials have differing views. In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told reporters that the credit squeeze and the housing downturn would impose a ''penalty'' on American economic growth. But Mr. Paulson noted American exports had climbed sharply, thanks to strong global economic growth. ''The positive is that the capital markets turmoil is taking place against the backdrop of a very strong global economy,'' Mr. Paulson said. The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, to $59.2 billion from an upwardly revised estimate of $59.4 billion in June. Wall Street had little obvious reaction to Mr. Bernanke's speech, though stock prices climbed gradually throughout the day, apparently on expectations that the central bank would lower the overnight federal funds rate at least one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent, at its meeting next week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 1.38 percent, at 13,308.39. The real debate among investors is whether the Fed will cut rates more deeply  --  by a half percentage point -- and what clues policy makers will offer about additional cuts before the end of the year. Mr. Bernanke did not touch on those issues on Tuesday. But he did caution that the flood of cheap capital from abroad was likely to taper off in the decades ahead, possibly leading to higher interest rates, as countries like China save less and consume more. ''The logic of the global savings glut suggests that, as the glut dissipates over the next few decades and thereby reduces the net supply of financial capital from emerging market countries, real interest rates should rise,'' he said. Mr. Bernanke coined the phrase ''global savings glut'' in 2005 to explain the historically peculiar phenomenon of an industrialized world awash in cash from developing countries. Some economists now believe that the flood of foreign money, some of it from investors seeking higher yields in the United States, contributed to the speculative bubble in housing prices and the explosive growth in high-risk mortgages that helped finance it. Others contend that the Federal Reserve played a major role as well, by cutting short-term interest rates to rock-bottom lows after the stock market's fall in 2000 and the recession in 2001. Mr. Bernanke cautioned that the United States current-accounts deficit was unsustainable over the long term and that the eventual adjustment could prove disruptive. Before his speech, Mr. Bernanke met with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the American mortgage market crisis and the need for greater market transparency. Several German banks have had to be rescued in recent weeks as a result of their losses on American mortgage-backed securities. European policy makers struck a largely upbeat tone on Tuesday, saying the European economy could weather the storm. ''It is important to remark that credit losses were not significant enough to materially impact the soundness of core financial institutions,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, told the European Parliament. Partly in response to the turbulence in credit markets, the European Central Bank decided last week to leave interest rates unchanged rather than lifting them as previously planned. The European Commission, in a new report on Tuesday, predicted that the European economy would continue to expand at a healthy pace but warned that the turmoil in financial markets had ''tilted the balance of risks clearly to the downside.'' The forecast said the 13-nation euro area would expand 2.5 percent in 2007, down from a prediction of 2.6 percent earlier this year. The full 27-nation European Union will grow by 2.8 percent instead of 2.9 percent, it said. It also revised its forecast for inflation slightly upward.  ",2007-09-12
2556,2480580137.xml,"European foreign ministers disagree about how to respond, but a diplomatic visit to Moscow will go ahead early in February, after the fate of Aleksei A. Navalny is clearer.BRUSSELS -- Despite pressure from some European Union countries on Monday to sanction Russia further after the arrest of the Kremlin critic Aleksei A. Navalny and thousands of his supporters, the bloc's top foreign policy official  will go ahead with a visit to Moscow early next month and meet with Russian officials first.The official, Josep Borrell Fontelles, will press the Russian government to release Mr. Navalny, according to diplomats in Brussels, and if not, new sanctions are possible. The decision came during a rare, in-person meeting of the European Union's 27 foreign ministers in Brussels.Mr. Borrell's trip to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, is expected after Feb. 2, when Mr. Navalny faces a court hearing that could send him to prison for several years. His supporters have called for people to take to the streets again on Sunday, two days before the hearing.In a news conference, Mr. Borrell said the foreign ministers had condemned the Russian crackdown on Mr. Navalny and his supporters and called for their release. He said he would be pleased to meet Mr. Navalny, and his situation would be a topic of discussion during his visit, but the trip was primarily to discuss strategic relations with Russia before a summit of European leaders in March.European leaders are ""ready to react"" and to act ""according to circumstances,"" Mr. Borrell said. While the foreign ministers differed about how to respond to Moscow, there were no concrete proposals made, so there was no need to take decisions now, he said.Tens of thousands of Russians rallied for Mr. Navalny in the streets of more than 100 Russian cities last Saturday in the biggest demonstrations the country had seen since at least 2017. Several thousand were arrested and sometimes beaten, bringing protests from the new Biden administration as well as from European countries.The European diplomats discussed imposing fresh sanctions on Russia on Monday after pressure from several capitals for a tough line, but decided to wait to see what happens to Mr. Navalny and the outcome of Mr. Borrell's visit.In October, the European Union imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over the poisoning of Mr. Navalny in August with Novichok, a deadly nerve agent created in Russia during the Soviet era.In the latest sign of how Mr. Navalny's campaign has shaken the Kremlin, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday took the unusual step of responding personally. Mr. Putin denied an extensive report by Mr. Navalny and his team that was released last week, after he was jailed, about the president's purported ""palace"" on the Black Sea. The video has been viewed more than 86 million times on YouTube, underscoring the Kremlin's vulnerability on the internet, which is mostly uncensored in Russia.""Nothing that is described as my property there ever belonged to me or my close relatives, and never did,"" Mr. Putin said in a televised video conference with university students. The video alleged that the vast, lavish property, said to include vineyards and an underground hockey rink, was controlled by friends and close associates of Mr. Putin who were holding it for him.Mr. Putin said he had no time to watch Mr. Navalny's 113-minute film in full, but had viewed excerpts. He dismissed it by quoting a line from ""The Twelve Chairs,"" an early Soviet novel: ""Girls, this is boring."" Mr. Putin has used the line at least once before -- to dismiss U.S. allegations of a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government in 2017.Threats of new sanctions are sure to be used by Russia's state media to describe Mr. Navalny as a plant or tool of the West. Over the weekend, television news reports prominently featured tweets by Mr. Borrell and other Western officials as evidence that Mr. Navalny was working against Russian interests.On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the United States ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, to criticize the American response to the pro-Navalny protests. Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, said that the support that the State Department had voiced for Mr. Navalny amounted to ""direct interference in the domestic affairs of our country.""The new attention on Russia extends to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, owned by the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom and 94 percent finished, that the United States is trying to stop through sanctions imposed on companies helping to lay the last miles of pipes. The Biden administration has confirmed Washington's opposition to the pipeline on the grounds that it benefits the Russian state, hurts the income of Ukraine and Poland and makes Germany more dependent on Russian natural gas.The Russians are preparing to lay pipes near Denmark with Russian-owned ships, while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany continues to insist that the pipeline is a commercial venture and will go ahead, despite the poisoning and arrest of Mr. Navalny.Berlin is hoping to resolve the problem with Washington through negotiations with the Biden administration, but it is possible that a solution will include at least a temporary suspension of the project.The European foreign ministers are also under pressure to further sanction Turkey for its violation of waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus with warships and a ship designed to explore for natural gas. They have held off as Germany has tried to get talks going between Turkey and Greece on the dispute, which became dangerously heated last summer and remains volatile.As the European ministers met on Monday, diplomats from Greece and Turkey were also meeting in Istanbul for the first talks in five years aimed at resolving their longstanding dispute over sea borders. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had a good relationship with former President Donald J. Trump, is also seeking to establish better relations with the Biden administration.Even as they sit down to talks, officials disagree on what they will be discussing. Greece wants the conversation limited to the delineation of the countries' continental shelves and corresponding energy rights -- the focus of last summer's dispute.But Turkey wants other areas of disagreement on the table, too, including the status of some islands in the Aegean and the rights of Greece's Muslim minority in Thrace.At his news conference, Mr. Borrell also said the ministers expected Britain to grant full diplomatic status to E.U. representatives and that they looked forward to working with the new Biden administration.""Be sure we will coordinate much, much better than in the past,"" he said.Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels and Anton Troianovsky from Moscow.

3675,433252716.xml,"      As Western governments debate how to punish Iran for its nuclear activities, Bush administration and European officials said Thursday that they wanted to avoid causing hardship or more anti-Western resentment in the Iranian public. The officials said that sanctions were not in the offing anytime soon, and they had ruled out any early steps toward an oil embargo or other sorts of sweeping economic punishments that would not only be opposed in Europe but would also cause internal suffering in Iran. Iran's leverage over the West because of its oil exports and trade agreements are a fact of life that American and European officials said made sanctions in that area impractical. But these officials also argue the importance of not alienating Iranians who might support the West, causing them to rally around their leaders. ''A heavy-handed sanctions approach is going to hurt an awful lot of Iranians that we don't want to alienate,'' said a State Department official who is working on the issue. ''We're going to have to be more surgical.'' President Bush and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany discussed the need for ''smart sanctions'' in a meeting last week, according to a German diplomatic official, with Mrs. Merkel in particular pushing for care in not angering the Iranian public. Various Western diplomats said Thursday that one way of punishing Iranian leaders would be to impose travel bans or freeze the assets of government officials in crucial ministries or business leaders close to the theocracy. Another step might involve acting against any businesses connected to Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Iran has denied having any such program. Bush administration officials cited as an example the Treasury Department's move on Wednesday to freeze assets of the director of Syrian military intelligence over that country's involvement in the assassination of Lebanese political figures. The issue of penalties has become more pressing as a Feb. 2 emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency approaches. Western officials are planning to refer Iran for action at that meeting, and proposals will then be considered in the United Nations Security Council and referred back to the atomic agency. Even as the notion of sweeping sanctions was being discounted, however, the administration also came under pressure on Thursday to move quickly toward such penalties. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a leading Democrat, announced that he would shortly introduce a resolution calling for just such a step. ''We have wasted valuable time, diverted resources and ignored this problem at our peril,'' Mr. Bayh said, noting that he supports a ban on gasoline sales to Iran and other economic punishments. ''No one wants to forestall the need to use military force more than I do, but if we are to do so, we must act now.'' As a practical matter, a resolution like the one Mr. Bayh put forward might be popular among senators but would also be unlikely to be voted on quickly, especially if the administration wants to hold off on punishments while it is in the final throes of negotiating with Europeans on what to do about Iran. Andy Fisher, a spokesman for Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, also said the committee generally favored waiting for the last stages of diplomacy to be played out before sanctions on Iran are considered. Even then, Mr. Fisher said, sanctions should be imposed in a way that did not replicate what happened in Iraq in the 1990's, when a ban on oil exports caused huge suffering among Iraqis but also led to profits among Saddam Hussein and his clique as they evaded the sanctions through the black market. In their discussions last week, Mrs. Merkel gave Mr. Bush a personal example of how such sanctions affected her fellow East Germans during the Communist years, the German diplomatic official said Thursday. She recalled that she and other Germans sympathetic to the West had no problem with Western actions that punished Communist leaders but that ''if we ran out of oranges or bananas, then we didn't like it.'' Even attempts to put pressure on the Soviet Union by banning their participation in the 1980 Olympics were unpopular among sympathetic Germans, Mrs. Merkel was said to have told Mr. Bush. The president's reaction was not known, but an administration official said a ban on World Cup participation was not being considered. Indeed, administration officials have maintained that permitting Iranian athletes or musicians to travel to the West should be encouraged, to help open Iran to outside influences, encourage defections and lead eventually to internal demands for change. ''The focus on smart sanctions makes sense because they work the best,'' said Patrick Clawson, deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''Big economic sanctions would not only be difficult to get, but Iran has vast foreign reserves from its oil revenues, so they can ride out what gets thrown at them.'' Mr. Clawson, who has written extensively about Iran, said Iranian leaders were acutely sensitive to being diplomatically isolated so that travel bans and asset freezes ''offer some pretty good prospects.'' A side benefit of such smaller sanctions, he said, is that ''what might be easier to achieve would also be more effective.'' American and European experts on Iran say corruption is a major problem and many Iranian leaders have foreign bank accounts, though they are in Europe and not the United States. Eventually, if negotiations fail to stop Iran from enriching uranium or taking other steps opposed by the West, European countries might act against those accounts, various diplomats said. Syrian Backs Iran Nuclear AimsBy The New York Times CAIRO, Jan. 19 -- President Bashar al-Assad of Syria greeted the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Damascus on Thursday and said he supported Iran's drive for a peaceful nuclear program. ''Syria supports the right of Iran and any country in the world to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes,'' Mr. Assad said during a joint news conference with Mr. Ahmadinejad. ''Those countries which object to this issue did not offer convincing reasons as to whether this is legitimate or not.'' During the news conference, Mr. Assad also repeated his long-standing demand that Israel give up nuclear weapons, and he insisted that any counterproliferation effort in the Middle East should begin with pressure on Israel. Thursday was the first day of Mr. Ahmadinejad's two-day visit to Syria, his first there since becoming president in August. The trip comes two weeks before an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's board to discuss Iran's nuclear program.

2654,1647296004.xml,"       BERLIN --  The leader of an anti-immigrant movement that has attracted tens of thousands of supporters and upended political debate in Germany stepped down on Wednesday after he was found to have posted an online image of himself as Adolf Hitler, after weeks of denying any Nazi sympathies. In the photograph, the leader, Lutz Bachmann, has his dark hair combed straight and severely parted above his right temple and wears a toothbrush mustache, closely resembling Hitler. The image was found on Mr. Bachmann's Facebook page and appeared on the front page of the mass-circulation newspaper Bild on Wednesday. It soon went viral on social media sites. The issue is a sensitive one in Germany, and Chancellor Angela Merkel and other high-ranking officials have repeatedly denounced the anti-immigrant movement, widely known by its German acronym Pegida, which stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. The controversy broke out even as the movement called on supporters to turn out on Wednesday in large numbers at an anti-immigration rally in the eastern city of Leipzig. The group, which has largely been confined to Dresden in eastern Germany, has grown a few offshoots, which are increasingly countered by larger marches throughout Germany in support of immigration. Mr. Bachmann, 41, told Bild that he was stepping down from the movement's leadership. Earlier in the day, he declined to comment on the image when reached by telephone. Nor would he address another exchange on social media in which he is quoted as having referred to immigrants as ""scumbags,"" ""stupid cows"" and ""trash."" Dresden prosecutors said they were investigating whether there were sufficient grounds to bring charges against Mr. Bachmann. German law forbids the display of Nazi symbols and punishes incitement and hate speech. ""Hitler photos, racist slogans, now we see what is really behind Pegida's middle-class facade,"" Sigmar Gabriel, Ms. Merkel's deputy chancellor, told Bild, deriding the group for posing as defenders of the people while harboring Nazi sentiments. ""Anyone involved in politics who dresses up as Hitler is either pretty much an idiot, or a Nazi,"" Mr. Gabriel said. On Wednesday, Mr. Bachmann's profile picture on Facebook had been changed to an image of Charlie Chaplin as the Great Dictator, from the 1940 film that parodied Hitler, with the comment, ""He can do satire ... not Lutz!"" Mr. Bachmann told Bild that he had posted the Hitler photo to coincide with the release of an audio version of a satirical book by Timur Vermes, a German writer, called ""Er Ist Wieder Da,"" or ""Look Who's Back,"" in which Hitler returns to Berlin in 2011. ""One has to be able to sometimes make fun of oneself,"" he told the paper. The surprising strength of the Pegida movement has dominated German political debate since late December, when the group attracted more than 10,000 people to its weekly marches through Dresden.  The authorities in Leipzig said some 35,000 people filled the city streets Wednesday night, with those marching for tolerance outnumbering Pegida's supporters. Pegida's primary goals are limiting the influx of immigrants, protecting the country's Judeo-Christian heritage and rejecting so-called hate preachers of any kind. Followers also rail about foreigners' living off German taxpayers. Chancellor Merkel and her government have repeatedly warned Germans against following Pegida, questioning the motives underlying its anti-immigrant message.  Pegida's leaders have largely avoided talking to the news media, and advise their followers to do the same, contributing to an air of mystery about the organization's origins. Mr. Bachmann was one of the more visible members of the leadership. Last fall, as the marches began, the local newspaper Sächsische Zeitung reported that Mr. Bachmann had a criminal record: convictions for 16 burglaries, driving drunk or without a license and dealing in cocaine. The newspaper also reported that he had worked as a publicist for nightclubs at one point. Interviewed last month before one of the Monday evening marches in Dresden, Mr. Bachmann was asked about his criminal past and whether it accorded with his concerns that immigrants were bringing crime to Germany. Addressing the marchers, he said, ""I, too, have a previous life,"" adding, ""If it is better for our cause, I am ready to step out of the unwanted spotlight."" Pegida has sought to play down allegations of links to the far right, insisting that it is a grass-roots movement of concerned citizens.  It has also sought to play down the reports that Mr. Bachmann has a criminal record, with Katrin Oertel, another leader, saying on national public television that everyone deserves a second chance. It was not clear if that belief would withstand the uproar caused by the publication of Mr. Bachmann's Hitler photo. The march in Leipzig on Wednesday night was organized after the German authorities prevented Pegida from holding its regular weekly march in Dresden on Monday because, they said, Mr. Bachmann had been the target of a terrorist threat.

147,2581131440.xml,"BERLIN -- You see it everywhere here in Germany, day in and day out: People taking the subway or bus or train put masks on as they prepare to board. And when they arrive at their stop or station and disembark, nearly all of them take the mask off, almost in unison.For someone who arrived here after spending the first year and a quarter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, it is a remarkable sight: a communal, matter-of-fact approach to mitigation, turning what has become such an intensely charged symbol for Americans into a mere practicality.This approach to masks and public transit is on display not only in cosmopolitan Berlin, but everywhere I've been in my reporting travels these past two months: I witnessed this effect in the eastern industrial city of Chemnitz, in the small western city of Erkelenz, and even in the rural eastern region of Lusatia, where the far-right Alternative for Germany Party, known here by its German initials as the AfD, had one of its strongest showings in the national elections last month. Mask on when you're inside the train or store; mask off when you're out of it.Throughout 2020 and the first part of 2021, I traveled across the United States reporting stories, and wondered why it was so hard for the country to arrive at a sensible middle ground on Covid-19 measures.Even after public health experts had established the vastly lower risk of transmission outdoors, I watched local officials close playgrounds and swimming pools, leaving young people with fewer options for low-risk activity and social contact. That was (mostly) the blue states. In one red town I attended a crowded memorial service in a windowless church where precious few people were wearing masks, and many shared embraces as though the virus simply didn't exist. All or nothing, nothing or all.And I saw how these wildly conflicting responses were fueling a vicious cycle of ever wider divides in behavior, with corrosive political side effects. For someone who had been documenting the country's growing political fissures for more than a decade, it was not hard to discern what was happening: Reports of Trump supporters refusing to wear masks in big-box stores or indoor campaign events seemed to make liberals more inclined to wear masks even when outdoors with few people around; seeing mask wearing turned into a political statement, more partisan talisman than necessary tool, in turn made many conservatives less likely to mask up indoors when the circumstances justified it.This was what Julia Marcus, a public-health researcher at Harvard Medical School, found when she interviewed mask skeptics last year: ""They said they felt ridiculous wearing a mask when there are few people around, like outdoors or in a spacious store,"" she wrote. ""When I agreed that masking isn't as important in certain settings, they became more amenable to wearing one when it matters most."" Overselling danger seemed, in other words, to have the opposite of the intended effect.So it has been striking to be in a country where common-sense protocols generally prevail. It might be tempting to chalk up the uniformity of Germans' behavior to their penchant for rule-following. This certainly helps explain why most Germans are observing requirements for masks on public transit or in stores, but it doesn't really explain why -- in contrast to what I witnessed in blue American cities -- I have seen so few people going over and above the rules here, wearing masks outdoors or in other situations where they are not required.No, it seems to me that the likelier explanation for the less polarized approach to virus mitigation behavior is that Germany is, well, much less polarized. Politics are so consensus-driven here that for the past eight years Germany has had a governing coalition consisting of the two largest parties.And this tendency was reflected in the response to the coronavirus: The difference between the share of Germans on the ideological right and left who thought there should have been fewer restrictions on public activity was 20 percentage points, a Pew survey found early this summer. In the United States, the difference between right and left on that question was a whopping 45 points, by far the largest gap of any country surveyed by Pew.This is not to say that Germany's 83 million people are utterly free of disagreement on Covid. The rate of people with at least one vaccination shot -- about 68 percent -- is lower than that of many other European countries, barely ahead of the United States, and lower than that of many American cities with strict Covid requirements still in place. This is, in part, because Germany particularly lags on vaccinating teenagers, compared to other European Union members, but it is also a sign that the country has its share of dissenters. And there have been large protests against mask mandates, travel restrictions and the proliferating vaccine requirements for restaurants, sports events and other gatherings, a movement called Querdenker (essentially ""against-the-grain thinkers"").Notably, this movement has been more ideologically heterogeneous than equivalent protest groups in the United States, with some left-leaning vaccine skeptics and people upset about nightclub closings in the mix. (This diversity may partly reflect the role of the police in enforcing masking and other Covid rules -- on several occasions, I've seen armed officers reminding transit riders on the platform to mask up -- which can scramble the lines of resistance.)To be sure, some of the anti-restriction rhetoric sounds similar to that in the United States -- in Chemnitz, a supporter of the AfD who had come out to heckle the Green candidate for chancellor told me that ""masks are humbug -- they don't help at all"" and that mask mandates served no purpose other than keeping people scared. The very next day, the police in southwestern Germany arrested a 49-year-old man accused of fatally shooting a 20-year-old gas-station clerk who had told him to wear a mask in the shop. It was reportedly the country's first instance of deadly violence apparently fueled by disputes over pandemic restrictions, a category of killing of which the United States has more than a half dozen examples.At the other end of the spectrum, there are still some head-scratching restrictions here that challenge scientific guidance, such as the museums that have still disabled audio features on exhibits for fear of visitors touching the same headsets.But German public health authorities seem to be making decisions with less concern than their American counterparts are about whether they will somehow abet right-wing narratives. For instance, requirements for proof of vaccination here in Germany can also be satisfied by showing that you've already had Covid, following the studies that have shown prior infection to provide strong protection. In the United States, public health officials seem to worry that anything validating anti-vaxxer claims about natural immunity will reduce vaccination rates. And education officials here speak much more freely about the downsides of masks in classrooms as they now start lifting school masking requirements.The role of the media undoubtedly plays a role, as well -- there are far, far fewer fear-stirring articles or segments in the national press or broadcast news here about, say, the potential risk that the coronavirus poses to children.The overall effect is of an environment set at a lower temperature, far closer to normalcy, where the public space is not forever on the verge of flaring into a divisive battleground of signaling, judgments and resistance.Meanwhile, the reports keep coming from what looks like an ever more inflamed landscape back home: incidents of resistance rage like the two people arrested at the Nashville airport in late August for refusing to wear masks on separate flights; officials in high-transmission areas barring mask mandates in schools while officials in low-transmission areas require schoolchildren (and college students) to wear masks even outdoors; a former Obama administration cabinet member comparing Americans opposed to mask requirements to the suicide bomber who killed about 170 Afghans and 13 American troops in Kabul. The middle ground seems more out of reach than ever.One day during the just-concluded election season here, I went to see a Berlin campaign rally for Olaf Scholz, the chancellor candidate of the center-left Social Democrats and, it now appears, the likely successor to Angela Merkel. Mr. Scholz invoked the unity and sense of purpose that Germany had demonstrated during the pandemic as his model for bringing the country together to confront other challenges, such as climate change. ""We saw in this corona crisis that we can hold together, that solidarity is possible in this country,"" he said.I couldn't help thinking that the line seemed far more plausible here than if used in the United States.A few weeks later, I went to a different campaign rally, for the far-right AfD in Lusatia. Hundreds of people gathered in a square in the small city of Görlitz to see the party's two top national candidates. Nearby were gathered dozens of counterprotesters, with police officers on hand to keep the two groups separate.None of the AfD supporters wore masks. Virtually all of the counterprotesters did, a rare incidence of outdoor mask wearing. Here, at last, in the most acute of political circumstances, was a stark Covid culture-war contrast. It felt almost like home.Alec MacGillis, a reporter for ProPublica and a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin, is the author of ""Fulfillment: Winning and Losing in One-Click America.""The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

3758,1656246467.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  Greece is headed toward a potentially destructive standoff with Europe after Germany rejected a last-minute request on Thursday to extend its loan program. Unless the two sides can bridge their differences, Greece could find itself cut off from its financial lifeline and facing insolvency. The country's current bailout program is set to expire in little more than a week. Neither country seems willing to budge at this point. While Greece on Thursday formally requested a six-month extension of its loan agreement, it stopped short of explicitly agreeing to complete some of the more onerous terms of the bailout. In a two-page letter to eurozone officials, the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said the goal was to ensure that ""any new measures be fully funded while refraining from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability."" Germany, though, is insisting that Greece stick with the original commitments to push through deeper reforms. A German Finance Ministry spokesman, Martin Jäger, said in a statement that the letter from Athens was ""not a substantial proposal to resolve matters."" The impasse sets the stage for another tense round of negotiations on Friday at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers here. The group typically operates by consensus. So if German opposition continues, a Greek deal may remain elusive without further concessions by Athens. Germany also has broad support from other eurozone nations. ""The written document does not meet the criteria agreed in the Eurogroup on Monday,"" Mr. Jäger said. He was referring to a meeting this week that ended in acrimony, with eurozone finance ministers giving Greece a deadline of Friday to come to an agreement or risk a cutoff of further loans. There were hints of the potential for compromise. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had a 50-minute telephone conversation on Thursday, which had a ""positive tone,"" according to Mr. Tsipras's office. The office said that the two leaders showed ""interest in finding a mutually beneficial solution for Greece and the eurozone,"" but it provided no further details. Mr. Tsipras later spoke to the French president, François Hollande. The Greek prime minister noted on his Twitter account that the French leader ""sincerely wants to find a mutually beneficial solution."" The differences between Germany and Greece are technical, but they also come down to questions of mutual trust. So far, the austere German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has shown little sympathy toward the claims of his Greek counterpart that the rigors of the bailout program are largely responsible for the country's struggling economy and high unemployment. At a meeting of eurozone officials on Thursday, a German official described the Athens proposal as ""a Trojan horse, intending to get bridge financing and in substance putting an end to the current program,"" according to a Greek government official.  Responding to the rejection of the loan extension, a Greek government official said that ""a part of the German government is against the Greek people, and this is due to Mr. Schäuble."" Officials of the German Finance Ministry declined to comment. Atmospherics aside, the two sides are split over a very specific technical issue: how closely Greece is prepared to abide by the tough conditions underpinning its bailout loans, which total 240 billion euros, or $273 billion. Mr. Varoufakis's letter, much of it written in legal language, indicated that Greece was willing to adhere to the general terms of the bailout loan agreement. One question left unanswered was whether that included adherence to a memorandum of understanding that contained crucial conditions for the country to receive loan payments. Many of those conditions, which include cuts in government spending, higher taxes and other economic changes agreed to by a previous government in 2012, are wildly unpopular in Greece. The leftist Syriza party of Mr. Tsipras was voted into power last month on an anti-austerity platform. The memorandum requires Greece to carry out reforms that the previous government had not yet put into effect, including changes in labor law that could make it easier for private companies to carry out mass layoffs. As a result, Mr. Tsipras's government is treading a fine line, trying to come to terms with its European creditors while not seeming to give too much ground on his promises to Greek voters. The Greek proposal is for a six-month extension of the country's loan agreement, but ""under different terms,"" said Gavriil Sakellaridis, a government spokesman. Another senior government official, Labor Minister Panos Skourletis, said on Greek television on Thursday that the country's request for an extension to its loan program ""in no way translates into an extension of the existing program, nor will it be accompanied by the known disastrous measures."" Unless Greece can come to an agreement with its European lenders, its current bailout program will expire at the end of the month. Without it, the government might soon not have enough money to meet its debt obligations. The lenders are the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the current negotiations involve only the European creditors, being represented by the Eurogroup of finance ministers. The group's signoff would be required before any Greek proposal could move forward for final European approval. And Germany is not the only eurozone member indicating a reluctance to give Greece much of a break. Finland shares Germany's reluctance to risk more of taxpayers' money by lending it to Greece. Other countries like Ireland and Portugal, which have hewed to their own austerity-pegged bailout programs, want Greece to have to do the same. And inevitably in politically charged negotiations, there are differences of style and approach. Germans, in particular, have been alarmed by the confrontational attitude of the Greek delegation led by Mr. Varoufakis, who is unusually plain-spoken and telegenic. He represents a frontal challenge to the settled order of quiet, back-room negotiation that characterizes most European deal making. The chaotic meeting of the Eurogroup on Monday, which included a flurry of leaks, could have given the impression that ""texts were being passed around under coats,"" Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, told reporters the next day. Since that last acrimonious meeting, senior officials have suggested that Mr. Varoufakis circulated documents with the goal of portraying a split between the Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, who has been helping to broker the talks. ""In a working process you have different documents circulating,"" Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president at the European Commission, said on Wednesday. ""But at the end of the day the issue, which apparently was raised by Minister Varoufakis, was to try to find some divisions between the president of the Eurogroup and Commissioner Moscovici,"" he said. ""There are no divisions,"" he insisted. ""There is a common understanding from the institutions how to move forward.""

3402,871527526.xml,"      BERLIN -- Germany, which declined to participate in the NATO air campaign against Libya, on Monday recognized the opposition National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of Libya, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said during a visit to the rebel capital of Benghazi.    The announcement by Mr. Westerwelle comes after weeks of hesitation by Germany over which rebel leaders or movements, if any, it would recognize as an alternative to the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.   ""The Transitional Council is the legitimate representation of the Libyan people,"" Mr. Westerwelle said after arriving in Benghazi. ""With this council, we want to support the building of a democratic and law-abiding Libya.""    Germany will open a small mission in Benghazi, joining the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, Britain, France, Spain, Malta and Qatar, which have established a presence there in the past several weeks. Washington, however, has not extended diplomatic recognition to the council.    Mr. Westerwelle's announcement comes just days after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited Washington in what was widely seen as a fence-mending mission designed to bury months of acrimony over the Greek debt crisis, the euro and Libya.   Germany, which joined the United Nations Security Council in January, surprised its allies when it abstained from voting on a resolution that authorized a no-fly zone over Libya and airstrikes to protect the civilian population from Colonel Qaddafi's forces, which at the time were advancing toward Benghazi.    The German government said then that it abstained because it opposed any military operation against Libya. It also said it was unsure of the goals of the mission, as well as whom the rebels represented and what their goals were.    Despite Germany's reservations, which were shared by several other countries, including Turkey and Poland, it did not block NATO from taking the lead in the airstrikes against the Qaddafi forces. Germany remained insistent, however, that it would not participate in any military action, and it put under national command its ships in the Mediterranean that had been serving under a NATO flag.    Thomas de Maiziere, the German defense minister, said last week that Germany would consider providing troops to any European Union mission designed to provide protection for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Libya. During her talks with President Obama in Washington, Mrs. Merkel promised that Germany would contribute to the reconstruction of Libya.       ",2011-06-14
341,2385113285.xml,"""We're at a place we've never been before,"" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday, hours after the United Nations secretary general called the coronavirus pandemic ""an unprecedented test"" that could lead to ""enhanced instability, enhanced unrest and enhanced conflict.""The secretary general, António Guterres, said the outbreak was the greatest challenge since World War II. A U.N. report went further, saying the coronavirus ""is attacking societies at their core."" The report urged global solidarity as the world comes to terms with the new realities of disruption and death -- a world in which 25 million jobs and roughly $3.4 trillion in labor income could simply disappear, according to the report.The report focused on the longer term. In the short term, the obvious question has been: When is this going to be over?When a reporter asked Mr. Cuomo that question, he said, ""The answer is, nobody knows for sure.""He cited one estimate that suggested 16,000 New Yorkers could die from the coronavirus. He also reviewed other projections that suggested the peak caseloads would come at the end of April, whether or not the rate of infection is reduced by preventive measures like social distancing.""This is not just New York,"" Mr. Cuomo said during a news conference in Albany. ""If you believe these numbers -- 16,000 deaths in New York -- that means you're going to get tens of thousands of deaths outside of New York.""So, to the extent people watch their nightly news in Kansas and say, 'Well, this is a New York problem,' that's not what these numbers say. It says it's a New York problem today. Tomorrow, it's a Kansas problem and a Texas problem and a New Mexico problem.""Republican and Democratic governors alike have challenged the Trump administration's claim that the United States has enough medical supplies. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, made another plea for federal help, saying the state was still struggling to get ventilators and other supplies.""Really, the only hope for a state at this point is the federal government's capacity to deliver,"" he said.In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had resisted issuing a statewide stay-at-home order, changed his mind after a telephone conversation with the president. Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, said he had started coming around when, on Tuesday, the White House extended its social-distancing guidelines through April 30. ""To me, that was, 'People aren't just going to go back to work,""' he said at a news conference in Tallahassee, the state capital. ""That's a national pause button.""Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada, a Democrat, also announced a stay-at-home order.XXXWimbledon and the Edinburgh International Festival answered the when-will-this-be-over question by saying: Not in time for this year. Both announced cancellations -- Wimbledon, the world's oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament, for the first time since World War II. It was to have begun on June 29. The Edinburgh festival, held in the Scottish capital every August since 1947, had been expected to draw performers from 70 countries.XXXHow aggressively should coronavirus rules be enforced? In Britain, the police are using drones and social-media shaming, and some police departments have warned stores not to sell chocolate Easter eggs. And people who cough maliciously, in the eyes of the police, are facing assault charges. The police in Spain have arrested people for coughing at supermarket workers, and in Pennsylvania, a woman who said she had the coronavirus was accused of coughing and spitting her way through the produce section of a supermarket before trying to shoplift a 12-pack of Coors Light beer.And when health workers or emergency medical workers are targeted, the charges can include terrorism: The police in New Jersey accused George Falcone, 50, of making a terror threat after he coughed on a food store employee and said he had the coronavirus.The Crown Prosecution Service in Britain said that people found guilty of coughing on emergency workers could face 12 months in prison. ""Let me be very clear: This is a crime and needs to stop,"" said Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions in Britain.President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines threatened to have the authorities shoot people protesting his lockdown orders. ""I am not used to being challenged,"" he said in a televised speech. ""Not me. Let this be a warning to all. Follow the government this time. It is critical that we have order.""XXXWhat in happier times were neighborhood hangouts are now off-limits. Mr. Cuomo announced that playgrounds in New York City would be closed, because people were not following social-distancing rules. Parks and other open spaces will remain open.Elsewhere, broader rules were extended and expanded. Japan widened its ban on entering the country. ""With the explosive expansion of infection seen mainly in Europe and America, we decided to take stronger border measures,"" said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan had already blocked arrivals from much of Europe and from parts of China and South Korea. But starting Friday, travelers from 49 other countries, including the United States, China and Australia, will be turned away. Japanese citizens returning home will be asked to quarantine themselves for two weeks, no matter where they have been.Nationwide lockdowns were extended through April 4 in Pakistan and indefinitely in Albania, and Bulgaria extended its state of emergency through May 13. Pakistan also renewed its ban on air travel into, out of and around the country. Albania had already ordered people to stay home for 16 hours a day -- and for 40 hours total on weekends -- and to keep their distance when they are allowed on the streets. The distance rule even applies to couples.Austria ordered people to wear masks in supermarkets. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that rules ordering nonessential businesses closed and banning almost all gatherings in public would remain in effect until at least April 19; the government will re-evaluate the situation after April 12.Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-04-02
263,433194163.xml,"      A prominent German archaeologist and aid worker who has lived and worked in Iraq for years has been kidnapped by armed captors who have threatened to kill her unless Germany withdraws its support for the Iraqi government. The abduction, disclosed Tuesday, was the latest in a new wave of kidnappings of Westerners, suggesting that after a yearlong lull, the tactic has regained currency as a preferred tool of intimidation by the Sunni-led insurgency. Susanne Osthoff, who tried to preserve some of Iraq's archaeological treasures and stop antiquities from being looted, was kidnapped with her driver, though the circumstances of the abduction were not immediately clear. A spokesman traveling with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, said in Washington that Ms. Osthoff, the first German citizen to be kidnapped in Iraq, had been missing since Friday. Images from a videotape delivered to the German state broadcaster ARD and shown Tuesday on international television showed two people in blindfolds flanked by three men whose faces were concealed by kaffiyehs. In the images, one of the men poses with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. The aid group Christian Peacemaker Teams confirmed that four of its workers had been taken hostage on Saturday in a neighborhood in western Baghdad. On Tuesday, the group posted their identities on its Web site: Norman Kember, 74, from London; Tom Fox, 54, from Clearbrook, Va.; James Loney, 41, from Toronto; and Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32, also a Canadian. The Arabic-language television station Al Jazeera showed a video showing the four men and displaying a passport with Mr. Kember's name. On the video, the kidnappers, who said they represented a militant group called Swords of Truth, accused their captives of being ''spies of the occupying forces.'' Al Jazeera did not say whether the group had made any demands or had threatened to execute the foreigners. More than 200 foreigners have been abducted since the American invasion 31 months ago. Dozens of them have been killed and about 20 are still missing. Kidnappings of Westerners -- and their occasional ghoulish corollary, videotaped beheadings -- peaked in late 2004 and virtually paralyzed the foreign community of government officials, executives, aid workers and journalists, who were forced to adopt stricter security measures and severely curtail their movements. During the American military siege on the insurgent stronghold of Falluja last November, troops discovered a number of bunkers where captives had apparently been held and tortured. After the Falluja offensive, kidnappings of Westerners fell off dramatically, though earlier this year a wave of kidnappings of foreign Arabs began, apparently intended to drive Muslim diplomats from Iraq and to undermine the government's efforts to strengthen diplomatic ties. Most recently, a Moroccan diplomat and his Moroccan driver were kidnapped in October, and Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has vowed to kill them. In July, gunmen abducted the top Algerian and Egyptian diplomats in Iraq. Militant Shiite opponents of the American-led foreign presence in Iraq are widely believed to have committed two recent high-profile kidnappings of Westerners, both journalists. Rory Carroll, a reporter for The Guardian, was abducted in October in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad but released unharmed after a day. In August, Steven Vincent, an American freelance journalist researching a book in the Shiite-dominated city of Basra, was abducted and killed. But the latest kidnappings bore the hallmarks of the Sunni-led rebel groups like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which have a penchant for televising their captors and issuing public pronouncements. In other violence on Tuesday, gunmen killed the senior Sunni cleric in Falluja, one of the few powerful figures in Anbar Province who had urged Sunnis to participate in the political process. The cleric, Shiek Hamza Abbas al-Esawwi, who had begun to receive death threats last summer, was killed as he left the mosque where he had led evening prayers. In a neighborhood just north of Baghdad, two American soldiers were killed when their patrol struck a concealed bomb, the American military reported. An Iraqi police officer was also killed and another was wounded by gunmen in a drive-by shooting in the Hay Al Jamea district, according to an Interior Ministry official. The kidnapping of Ms. Osthoff, whom Reuters reported to be 43, has riveted a German public that has long been skeptical about the Iraq war, which Germany has opposed from the beginning. Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing her first crisis since taking office last week, on Tuesday called on Ms. Osthoff's kidnappers to release the archaeologist, who also tried to provide Iraqis with medical aid. ''We condemn this act in the harshest possible terms,'' Mrs. Merkel said in a brief statement. ''We urgently appeal to the perpetrators to hand both of them over into safe custody,'' she said. The name of Ms. Osthoff's driver was not released. Mrs. Merkel said the government had set up a crisis committee to address the kidnapping, and she told the family of Ms. Osthoff in Germany that everything would be done to secure her release. Germany has consistently refused to send troops to Iraq, and Mrs. Merkel has vowed not to change that policy. But she has also said she will continue Germany's training of Iraqi police officers in the United Arab Emirates, an activity that the kidnappers apparently were referring to in their demand that Germany stop cooperating with the Iraqi government. In a decision that echoed the response in France to the kidnapping earlier this year of Florence Aubenas, a French journalist, German television focused all day on Ms. Osthoff as well as her activities in Iraq. Ms. Osthoff, the German news media reported, has lived in Iraq for many years and is fluent in Arabic. She had been married to an Iraqi man, but the couple divorced some years ago. ''She has been bringing medicine and medical equipment to Iraq for years,'' Ms. Osthoff's mother, who has been identified in the German news media only as Ingrid H., said on German television. Ms. Osthoff's uncle, Peter Osthoff, told The Associated Press that she had broken almost all ties with her family, including her 11-year-old daughter, who attends a boarding school in southern Germany. Her mother told German television that she had not heard from her daughter for nearly five years. Ms. Osthoff told a colleague in September that she believed her life was in danger because of her work in preserving and restoring Iraqi sites. She received threats for her work in the ethnically divided northern city of Mosul, where she was paying local laborers to restore a Christian church or monastery, said the colleague, McGuire Gibson, a Mesopotamia archaeologist at the University of Chicago. Ms. Osthoff had said an American officer approached her with intelligence indicating that her work had not been appreciated in some quarters of the city. ''She said that they'd gotten a report that the German archaeological woman was to be 'gotten,' '' meaning kidnapped or killed, Mr. Gibson said. ''That's the last time I saw her.''  But Ms. Osthoff also upset people in the Shiite-dominated south, where she and a longtime colleague, Bartold Hrouda of the University of Munich, conducted extensive digs at the important archaeological site at Isin during the 1980's, Mr. Gibson said. During the 1990's, Mr. Gibson said, Ms. Osthoff shuttled medical supplies into Iraq and continued to draw attention to conditions at Isin, including problems with the smuggling of Mesopotamian artifacts abroad, where they had been sold for large sums in Europe and Asia. ''She was very, very brave,'' he said. ''She would just go plunging into these things.''  Michael Muller-Karpe, an archaeologist at the Romische-Germanische Central Museum in Mainz, Germany, said he also believed that the kidnapping was connected to efforts by Ms. Osthoff to stop illegal excavations of Iraqi antiquities. Mr. Muller-Karpe said he saw Ms. Osthoff in Iraq about a year ago, when they scrapped a plan to travel to southern Iraq to publicize the damage to archaeological sites there. ''At that time we were warned by people and we were told that they didn't want any foreigners there, because they feared that they would have trouble,'' Mr. Muller-Karpe said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. He said some of the proceeds from the illegal sale of Mesopotamian relics went to terrorist groups. It was unclear whether, at the time of her abduction, Ms. Osthoff was accompanied by security guards, a basic precaution taken by most Westerners traveling and working in Iraq. But Mr. Muller-Karpe said that Ms. Osthoff considered herself to be an Iraqi and never traveled with a security guard, despite the threats she had received. It is also not known whether the four aid workers who went missing over the weekend were traveling in the company of security guards. But a human rights worker in Baghdad, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Christian Peacemaker Teams had usually moved without armed guards through communities generally hostile to the foreign presence. The human rights worker said that the group's representatives had entered mosques in predominantly Sunni neighborhoods to offer their services in helping to find missing family members and that they had accompanied families fleeing to the border. Though the organization has declared its opposition to the American invasion and occupation of Iraq, the insurgency has made it clear that all foreigners, even those who are politically aligned with them, could be military targets. Many groups that have claimed responsibility for recent kidnappings have also claimed links to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Most major international aid and reconstruction organizations, like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, have pulled most of their foreign staff from Iraq. Soldiers Told to Intervene in Abuse  (By The New York Times) WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 -- Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that American soldiers who witness Iraqi security forces abusing prisoners are required to try to stop the mistreatment. ''It is absolutely the responsibility of every U.S. service member, if they see inhumane treatment being conducted, to intervene to stop it,'' General Pace told reporters at a Pentagon news briefing. He made his remarks after published reports of kidnappings and executions of Sunnis by men in Iraqi police uniforms. In describing the duty of American soldiers to stop prisoner abuse, General Pace went further than Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who told reporters at the same event that troops were required to ''report'' abuse. ''Any instance of inhumane behavior is obviously worrisome and harmful,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''But I don't think you mean they have an obligation to physically stop it; it's to report it.''  But General Pace responded, ''Sir, they have an obligation to try to stop it.''  In an image yesterday on Al Jazeera, four hostages were pictured. Christian Peacemaker Teams, who sponsored the men's work, identified them, from left, as Tom Fox, of Clearbrook, Va.; James Loney, of Toronto; Norman Kember, of London; and Harmeet Singh Sooden, another Canadian.; Susanne Osthoff (in a photo from February 2004), of Germany, and her driver were seized Friday, it was learned yesterday.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Quirinale Palace in Rome on Friday, Oct. 29, 2021. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times)


ROME — After a six-week diplomatic spat that involved a scuttled nuclear-powered submarine deal and a recalled ambassador, President Joe Biden began a one-on-one effort to mend fences with President Emmanuel Macron of France by saying the U.S.' handling of the matter had been “clumsy.”
“What we did was clumsy,” Biden told reporters, sitting beside Macron just before they began a private meeting. “It was not done with a lot of grace.”
He added, “I had been under the impression long before that France had been informed.”
France had an agreement to build conventionally powered submarines for Australia’s navy, but last month the United States and Britain announced their own deal with Australia for nuclear-powered subs instead. Australia called off the deal with France, whose officials had not been told that a pact with the Americans and British was in the works, infuriating Macron and others in his government.
Washington’s European allies were already irritated by the handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they said Biden ordered without consulting them. The treatment of the French submarine deal, they said, was further evidence of American dismissiveness.
Since that agreement was sabotaged, the two countries have worked hard to overcome the dispute, and the Biden administration has sent officials to Paris, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to try to smooth things over. Unsatisfied with the niceties, France has demanded “concrete” results.
“Now what’s important is to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future,” Macron said in his own remarks to reporters. “This is an extremely important clarification.”
Some of those results the French have demanded may be forthcoming but were not announced when the two spoke to reporters before a lengthier diplomatic meeting.
American and French officials said the United States was prepared to bolster France’s counterterrorism efforts in Africa, including possibly sending additional reconnaissance planes and drones to the $110 million airfield that the United States has built in the desert scrub near Agadez, Niger.
The Biden administration will also try to address one of Macron’s priorities by giving a guarded backing to a European military force that is separate from NATO, the officials said.
It would also be viewed in Paris as a sign of American respect after the perceived insult of the secretly negotiated Australian submarine deal.
Officials said they hoped the U.S.' moves would put to rest the fight between the United States and France.
“The United States is still our major ally,” said Gen. Thierry Burkhard, the French military’s chief of staff. “But what we need is a very clear sign that trust can still be there.”
With his domestic agenda in limbo and tensions with China and Russia smoldering, Biden kicked off a whirlwind international tour Friday in Rome, where he also met with Pope Francis to discuss global challenges like the pandemic and climate change.
The meeting — the president’s first with Francis since his inauguration — had deep emotional resonance for Biden, a Roman Catholic. The president and the pope share common ground on many issues, and Biden seemed visibly excited as he headed into a private meeting, which lasted 90 minutes.
During their meeting, Biden thanked Francis for his advocacy for the world’s poor and people suffering from hunger, conflict and persecution, the White House said, adding that he had also lauded the pope’s leadership in the climate crisis and his advocacy on coronavirus vaccines.
Francis has repeatedly called on pharmaceutical companies to waive intellectual property protections for their coronavirus vaccines on the grounds that doing so would be a “gesture of humanity.” In May, Biden said he supported the suspension of some of those protections, but large manufacturers have argued that increasing production is a more effective way to help end the pandemic.
After the Vatican visit, Biden is set to attend the Group of 20 summit, and then, he and many of the same leaders will travel to Scotland for COP26, a worldwide summit on climate change that is billed by many as a make-or-break moment to save a warming planet from disaster.

For Biden, the international events come against the backdrop of high-stakes negotiations over his domestic agenda. But participants in the summits from across the globe are all facing enormous challenges, many linked to the pandemic and the health and economic devastation it has wrought.
The agenda would be daunting even in normal times, but this is the first G-20 meeting in person since the virus emerged. Many of those who are coming hope to deliver concrete changes on issues like international tax shelters and getting coronavirus vaccines to the developing world, even as they struggle to make progress on existential issues like lowering carbon emissions and addressing energy shortages.
Between the meetings with Francis and Macron, Biden headed to the Chigi Palace, the home of Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi. It was not just a polite drop-by. With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany leaving the scene and Macron politically embattled, Draghi has emerged as a leader of Europe and a potentially key interlocutor for a U.S. president looking to keep alliances strong on the Continent.

89,1689794846.xml,"       The new papal encyclical on the environment is a ringing call to action, a critique of consumerism and a prophetic warning about the dangers of ignoring what Pope Francis calls ""the ecological crisis."" But amid all his soaring rhetoric, did the pope get the science right? The short answer from climate and environmental scientists is that he did, at least to the degree possible in a religious document meant for a broad audience. If anything, they say, he may have bent over backward to offer a cautious interpretation of the scientific facts. For example, a substantial body of published science says human emissions have caused all the global warming that has occurred over the past century. Yet in his letter, Francis does not go quite that far, citing volcanoes, the sun and other factors that can influence the climate before he concludes that ""most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases"" released mainly by human activity. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, pointed out that the bulk of the evidence suggests that solar changes and volcanoes have slightly counteracted the warming effect of greenhouse gases. ""Human activity is most likely responsible not just for 'most global warming' but all of it, and then some, because natural factors have been acting slightly in the other direction,"" Dr. Mann said. When reciting facts, as opposed to making judgments, the pope aligns himself squarely with mainstream scientific thinking. Indeed, those sections of the document could serve as a syllabus for Environmental Science 101 in just about any college classroom. The pope offers elementary descriptions of a litany of ecological problems, global warming chief among them, that include air and water pollution, the wanton destruction of forests, the wasteful use of resources and many more. When the pope transitions in his encyclical from fact to judgment, though, his language is less measured. ""The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,"" Francis declares. ""In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish."" The pope is careful to acknowledge that there has been some progress, with stricter environmental laws in some countries leading to cleaner air and water. But he points out, and environmental experts agree, that impoverished people bear a disproportionate burden from pollution in rich and poor countries alike. They have benefited least from fossil fuels, he adds, but are first in line to suffer as the effects of global warming intensify. The pope's careful calibration of the scientific facts was no accident, of course. The Vatican has been consulting for many months with leading experts. Among them was Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, who is the founder and head of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and a primary environmental adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. In an interview, Dr. Schellnhuber, who was raised a Lutheran, said he was especially impressed with the pope's determination to reach beyond the Catholic faithful, attempting to speak, in Francis' own words, to ""every person living on this planet."" The hard lesson scientists have learned in recent years, Dr. Schellnhuber said, is that presenting the facts and data about global warming and other environmental problems has not been enough to move the public to action. The issues have become so serious that only a broad moral awakening can offer hope of solving them, he said. In aligning himself with mainstream scientific thinking, Francis invites criticism from people who dispute the science of climate change -- indeed, these contrarians were attacking his paper even before it was issued. But the more meaningful critiques in coming weeks may come from those experts schooled in environmental policy. The scattered policy prescriptions in the document do not display the meticulous framing of the scientific statements. For instance, Francis devoted a long paragraph to criticizing an approach called carbon trading that can be used to put a price on greenhouse emissions, even though many environmental economists favor that approach.

852,1749106823.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  European Union authorities on Tuesday proposed taking control of border and coastal security at entry points for migrants in countries like Greece and Italy, to get a grip on a crisis that has divided the bloc and fed the rise of populist political movements. Officials at the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said the centralized approach to border security would bolster confidence that the union can manage the migration crisis and would save one of its flagship policies -- the Schengen rules that allow the free movement of citizens across most of Europe's internal borders. The proposal was expected to be discussed at a summit meeting of the national leaders of the European Union's 28 member states in Brussels on Thursday. Like the long effort to save the euro that began six years ago, the migration crisis is mainly focused on pushing one country, in this case Greece, to abide by European Union rules in exchange for greater support from other countries, namely Germany, that fear the repercussions of problems on the union's periphery. Rescuing Greece from a messy departure from the single currency took years of grinding negotiations, and approval for the new border system could get bogged down in similar procedures involving national governments and the European Parliament. That could turn the proposal into another example of Europe's seeming inability to respond to crises in a coordinated fashion. The proposals already face opposition in countries like Poland where some politicians suspect a blunt power grab by Brussels intended to diminish national sovereignty. An initiative pushed this year by the commission to relocate tens of thousands of people from Greece and Italy to other European Union countries has failed to gain much traction; only around 200 people have been moved so far. Even so, momentum has been building in France and Germany for the kind of initiative that was announced on Tuesday. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has come under severe pressure to reduce the number of migrants clamoring for asylum in wealthy northern European countries. Reinforcing the bloc's external borders is also a priority for France, where two of the participants in terrorist attacks in Paris last month posed as refugees to enter the European Union through Greece. The borders that migrants ""cross are not just Greek borders or Bulgarian borders -- they are European borders,"" Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission, said at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. That made such borders a ""collective responsibility,"" and ""if we don't protect them in the right way, the consequences will be for all Europeans,"" he said. ""I call particularly on Eastern European countries to show solidarity with others,"" Mr. Timmermans added. Before the two-day meeting that begins on Thursday, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body that represents European leaders, called on national leaders to ""regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve"" free movement of citizens. The plan would double the staff of the current border agency, Frontex, and would create a separate reserve force, drawn from national authorities responsible for border management, to create a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The new agency would have a permanent staff of 1,000 people. The most sensitive element of the proposals is a so-called rapid reserve pool of 1,500 border guards, drawn from countries in the bloc that are part of its free movement zone and who could be deployed to vulnerable areas within three days, even when a member state rejects such help. The agency ""will be able to step in to ensure that action is taken on the ground even where there is no request for assistance from the member state concerned or where that member state considers that there is no need for additional intervention,"" the commission said in an explanatory document. Whether the new agency or the national authorities would have the final say on whether the border force should be deployed is likely to be among the most delicate issues standing in the way of quick approval. There are also concerns from advocacy groups and others over whether the new agency would be sufficiently accountable to protect the rights of migrants. The proposal announced on Tuesday contained several other initiatives, including the creation of a European Return Office made up of ""escorts, monitors and return specialists"" to help remove ""illegally staying third country nationals"" from the European Union. To bolster security, there should be ""mandatory systematic checks of E.U. citizens at external land, sea and air borders,"" the commission said.

2427,2138443139.xml,"BERLIN -- A new political force is shaking up Germany: Its leaders campaign in Bavarian beer tents wearing traditional dirndls and tour the country quoting the national anthem. One member recently wrote a book about patriotism, another about ""new conservatism."" One of its biggest issues is immigration.Last month, it dealt Chancellor Angela Merkel such a blow at the ballot box -- twice -- that she announced her retreat.No, it is not the far right. It is a re-energized left.In recent years, the political energy has seemed to come almost exclusively from the right. But while the rise of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has gotten the most attention, the liberal, pro-refugee Greens party has quietly expanded its following.Once an environmental protest movement, the Greens party is now the second-most popular party in the country, lagging behind the conservatives by only a few percentage points, polls show. Among women, it is already No. 1.It was also the Greens' success that forced the chancellor's decision not to run for re-election -- shattering a host of entrenched narratives about voters and politics in Germany.The secret?""We are the anti-populists,"" said Robert Habeck, the party's co-leader, who published a book in 2008 about what he calls positive patriotism. ""We see ourselves at the center of the nation, and that also means reclaiming the symbols of our country from the nationalists.""Indeed, if Alternative for Germany -- which has campaigned on fears of a Muslim takeover and immigrant crime -- embodies the backlash against the zeitgeist, then the Greens represent the backlash against the backlash and for the prevailing ethos of the country.The eroding appeal of the old catchall parties, left and right, has left a lot of votes up for grabs. Alternative for Germany has picked up many of them. But the Greens have emerged as ""the alternative to the Alternative,"" said Katharina Schulze, the 33-year-old Greens party star of the recent Bavarian election.Over the past year, the Greens have steadily taken four times as many votes from Ms. Merkel's conservative alliance than from the AfD. They have shaved off even more votes from her left-leaning coalition partners, the Social Democrats.In fact, it is the long participation of the Social Democrats as a junior partner in successive Merkel governments that has left many voters yearning for a more defined and vocal opposition.The rise of the Greens has reinforced the new fragmentation of Germany's political landscape into a field of midsize parties. Some now see the Greens taking over as the main center-left party, even as they have drawn support from around the political spectrum.Their new strength has helped highlight new fault lines -- between open and closed, pro-Europe and nationalist, but also between urban and rural, female and male, and western Germany and eastern Germany.The party has come a long way since its founding as a pacifist ""anti-party party"" in 1979. Opposition, not governing, was the aim in those early days.The first Greens lawmakers wore flowing beards and blue jeans in the chamber. Some knitted during parliamentary debates; others nursed their babies or brought along a pet.Today, many voters see the Greens as a party that has matured while remaining true to its principles. They are pro-environment, pro-Europe and unapologetically pro-immigration.Joschka Fischer, a leftist rebel who served as foreign minister under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, embodies his party's evolution from radical protest to moderate middle.When Mr. Fischer was sworn in as Germany's first Greens minister in the state of Hesse in 1985, he wore a pair of sneakers -- a provocation at the time.Three decades later, Mr. Fischer's white sneakers are in a museum, and almost one in two German voters say they can imagine casting a ballot for the Greens.""The Greens have learned to do politics in the center,"" said Mr. Fischer, whose cellphone ringtone is Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" Europe's hymn.Voters, especially urban and educated Germans, relate to the Greens because the party represents a gentrified lifestyle, from healthy eating to a certain self-image of liberal nonconformism, that was once considered niche but has become mainstream well beyond the Greens' core electorate.Mr. Fischer calls this ""the subversive power of Green lifestyles."" One example he cites is Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the AfD, a lesbian with a doctorate and nonwhite partner with whom she has two sons.If the Greens have become more mainstream, then the mainstream has also become more green. And the Greens have avoided becoming boring in the process.Mr. Habeck, 49, the party co-leader from Germany's northern seaside, celebrated the recent election successes by diving into a crowd of supporters.In Hesse, where the party's strong showing prompted Ms. Merkel's surprise retreat, Greens posters celebrated ""Heimat"" -- a fuzzy but evocative term denoting homeland and identity but traditionally associated with the right -- underneath two intertwined hands, one white, one black.""You are Hessian, if you want to be Hessian,"" the poster read.The party's lead candidate in Hesse, Tarek al-Wazir, is the son of a Yemini immigrant. Internet trolls warned that a vote for him was a vote for Shariah, or Islamic law.Yet Mr. Wazir more than doubled the Greens' share of the vote. He is the most popular politician in the state.For voters like Peter Weilbächer, a tax adviser in Wiesbaden, the capital of Hesse, ""the Greens are credible where the others aren't.""Mr. Weilbächer said he had always voted conservative, but this time, he switched to the Greens, calling them the ""real conservatives.""""They want to conserve what we have: the environment, our prosperity and our values,"" he added.That platform has already brought the Greens into government in nine of Germany's 16 states, including Hesse, where Mr. Wazir is the deputy to a conservative premier.In neighboring Baden-Württemberg, the Greens have become the strongest party, relegating Ms. Merkel's conservatives to junior partners in government.A prolonged period of healthy economic growth and low unemployment has allowed voters, especially those in western states, to turn their attention to the environment. ""We can afford to pay off our ecological conscience,"" said Frauke Volpert, a 44-year-old photographer.But the party also benefits from a long tradition of environmentalism in Germany that cuts across the political spectrum, from the progressive left to 19th-century Romantic nationalists describing the forest as the home of the German soul.In their founding days, the Greens also had a lot of interest from the right. ""We had everything from leftists who wanted to sabotage electricity pylons to quasi neo-Nazis,"" said Hubert Kleinert, a political scientist and former lawmaker.The extremists were soon purged from the party. Today, the internal battles between idealists and pragmatists have mostly been resolved by a fresh-faced new leadership.Winfried Kretschmann, a Roman Catholic who became the Greens' first state premier in Baden-Württemberg in 2011, recently wrote a book about what it means to be conservative today. At a time when the extremes are flourishing, one of his calls to action is, ""Dare to be in the center.""The biggest challenge is in eastern Germany, home to several coal mines, where the Greens are still mostly seen as a ""West German party that protects refugees instead of jobs,"" Mr. Fischer said.But not so long ago, Bavaria, the Catholic conservative bastion of western Germany, also seemed impenetrable to the Greens. In October, the party became No. 2 in the state and won Munich, the capital.Before the election, Ms. Schulze had campaigned in her dirndl, winning over voters with her political motto: ""Saving the world pragmatically -- one step at a time.""The Greens' success in places like Bavaria, Mr. Fischer said, is beyond anything he had ever imaged. ""It's like the Greens becoming the second-biggest party in Texas,"" he said.Still, Mr. Fischer, cautioned against hyping the current success of his party too much. He recalled the first time he was elected to Parliament in 1983. As he passed the chancellery, he told a colleague: ""That's the next stop.""That may still be a long way away.Credit: KATRIN BENNHOLD; Christopher F.

What he lacks in verbal zingers he makes up for with physical ones.Body language -- both his and that of the pitiable people around him -- is telling the story of Donald Trump's foreign adventure better than anything else.When I say ""pitiable,"" I'm thinking about the pope, of course, and the first lady, naturally, but especially Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro, who was the visibly stunned victim of the shove heard round the world.Please tell me you saw it. Markovic, Trump and other heads of state were arranging themselves for a photograph. And Markovic had the misfortune to be standing between Trump and the front of the pack, a lesser beauty in the bossy prom queen's path.But not for long! Trump batted him out of the way, perhaps mistaking him for a political reporter or picturing James Comey. Then, triumphal, Trump straightened his suit jacket, stiffened his posture and raised his fleshy chin. He was ready for his close-up.You tiny, tiny, tiny little man. pic.twitter.com/mP3mad6cMt -- J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) May 25, 2017With Trump, struts, scowls and pouts reveal every bit as much as what tumbles from his lips, which is a lot less trustworthy. His words can be counterfeit. His gestures are genuine. So it only makes sense that we lean on them for the narrative of his post-truth presidency, whose latest, foreign chapter brimmed with more awkward physicality than a toddlers' gymnastics class.The shove heard round the world was preceded by the curtsy heard round the world, when Trump did precisely what he maligned President Obama for -- well, one of the countless things he maligned President Obama for -- and approached Saudi Arabia's monarch, King Salman, in a pose of deference. Hypocrisy, thy name is Trump, and thy knees are bent and thy head is bowed.Thy sense of rhythm doesn't exist. Did you see him during that Saudi dance, not so much rattling his saber as dangling it while he wobbled, like a Weeble, from side to side? I imagined the following dialogue balloon above his head: ""When I told the king I was a swordsman, this wasn't what I meant.""And here is President Trump dancing in Saudi Arabia. pic.twitter.com/6KkCmwoVvN -- David Mack (@davidmackau) May 20, 2017And the dialogue balloon above Pope Francis's head when he posed with Trump in Vatican City later in the week would have said: ""Forgive me, Father, for I cannot fake delight."" I've been told by Vatican insiders that the pope never forgets that he's on camera and that the precise angle of his eyes and curl of his lips are being captured. He stared straight ahead, his mien as joyless as a gulag.George Bernard Shaw wrote a play titled ""Arms and the Man."" Someday somebody will write a Trump biography titled ""Hands and the Man.""From Spy magazine's long-ago caricature of Trump as a ""short-fingered vulgarian"" to that unforgettable moment during a Republican presidential debate when he displayed his digits to try to prove the opposite -- Look, Ma, big hands! -- his paws have been at center stage.That remained true on the trip. In Israel, there was the swat heard round the world, when, walking alongside Bibi Netanyahu across a red carpet, he noticed that Netanyahu was holding his wife's hand and so reached back for Melania's.Well this is embarassing https://t.co/XaPL1AbCm5 pic.twitter.com/mumhuQHDFz -- Haaretz.com (@haaretzcom) May 22, 2017To say that she withheld it would be an understatement.

Director John Brennan testified today that there was contact between President Trump's campaign and Russian officials. However, still no contact between Donald and Melania.""[Video: The Beatles - I Want To Hold Your Hand - Performed Live On The Ed Sullivan Show 2/9/64 Watch on YouTube.]There's so much she could still be smarting over, including the inauguration back in January, when her husband bounded out of the car and up the steps before her, rushing to greet the Obamas and leaving her in his wake.[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]Courtesy: absent. Chivalry: dead. Her revenge came soon after, on the inaugural stage. She let a smile at her husband drop from her face so quickly and emphatically that it was like an announcement to the world that she'd been wearing a mask.But back to our president's paws, which aren't just at center stage but also at the center of so much controversy. When Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited him in Washington in mid-March, there was debate over whether he denied her a handshake that she'd suggested or simply didn't hear her request.The tension in their postures prompted observations about how much more relaxed she and Obama always seemed, but there was another point of comparison -- a weirder one -- if President George W. Bush came into the picture. At a G8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg in 2006, he walked up behind Merkel, who was seated, and massaged her shoulders. This visibly surprised her. It didn't seem to amuse her much, either.Amusement wasn't a word that popped to mind when you saw pictures and read accounts of Trump's encounters with Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected president of France, in Brussels on Thursday. Maybe that's because Trump was once again sowing doubt about his commitment to NATO. Or maybe that's because he reportedly told Macron that he'd supported him, even though his affections had clearly been for Marine Le Pen of the National Front.À Bruxelles, unis avec nos alliés de @NATO. pic.twitter.com/7nyaoI8hki -- Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 25, 2017Whichever the case, Macron at one point seemed to swerve away from Trump, despite Trump's outstretched arms, so he could embrace Merkel instead.At another point, during a formal greeting, Macron and Trump "" grabbed each other's hands, jaws clenched, in an extended grip that turned Mr. Trump's knuckles white,"" according to The Times.""Their faces tightened,"" reported The Washington Post. ""Trump reached in first, but then he tried to release, twice, but Macron kept his grip.""Sacred texts have received less scrupulous analysis than Trump's foreign-leader handshakes, his presidential-debate snorts (remember those?) and the reactions -- aghast, awe-struck, puzzled, peeved -- of those who bump up against (or happen to be married to) him.I think that's fitting, not just because his actual speech is so honesty-challenged but also because the analyzers are paying respect to the way he takes in information. He prefers television to reading, images to pesky words. Shouldn't we return the favor when appraising him?And aren't we in the right to take note of an Israeli diplomat's physical reaction when Trump said, in Israel, ""We just got back from the Middle East,"" as if Israel were in South America or something?

623,1018126742.xml,"      BERLIN -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Friday that he rejected outside military intervention as an answer to the increasingly horrific bloodshed in Syria, and the Kremlin publicly sided with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in blaming Mr. Assad's armed rebel opponents for a massacre there last week that incited world outrage.    But Mr. Putin said he agreed with fears expressed by Western leaders and United Nations officials that the 15-month-old Syria conflict is hurtling toward civil war, and he asserted that Russia backed neither side despite his country's longstanding support for the Syrian government, its last significant relationship in the Middle East.   Syrian rights activists, Western and Arab countries, as well as United Nations officials, have said the evidence points to complicity by the Syrian military and pro-Assad militiamen for the May 25 massacre in Houla, a cluster of villages in western Syria. The main United Nations human rights body voted overwhelmingly on Friday to authorize an inquiry that Navi Pillay, the top United Nations rights official, said could lead to war-crimes charges. Even as that vote was under way, another mass killing was reported in Syria, the third in a week.   Mr. Putin's remarks on Syria, coming during stops in Germany and France as he began his first foreign trip since reclaiming the Russian presidency, were scrutinized for any hint of a shift in the Russian position on Syria that could help change the course of the conflict, which has become the most protracted and violent of the Arab Spring revolts.    Russia's objection to any effort by the United States and its allies that could lead to a forceful United Nations Security Council intervention in Syria and the ouster of Mr. Assad has been a major source of contention. But Mr. Putin showed no sign of yielding to pressure from either Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, or later with Francois Hollande, the new president of France.   ""We are seeing nascent elements of a civil war today. This is extremely dangerous,"" Mr. Putin said at a news conference with Ms. Merkel after their discussions. At the same time, he dismissed the idea that outside military power was a solution, telling reporters, ""You cannot do anything by force.""   He also said: ""Those who say that Russia unilaterally supports the Assad regime are mistaken. We and Syria have maintained good relations for years, but we do not support either party from which a threat of civil war emanates."" As for reports that Russia is arming the Syrian military, Mr. Putin said, ""Russia is not shipping weapons that could be used in a civil conflict.""   In her remarks, Ms. Merkel told reporters that they had both made clear that they supported the Syria peace plan by Kofi Annan, the special representative from the United Nations and the Arab League, and both she and Mr. Putin ""have the same interests regarding stability in the whole region, even if there is the one or the other odd difference in the path to get there.""   Later in Paris, the contrast between the Russian and Western positions was more pronounced. Mr. Hollande told reporters that United Nations sanctions were probably necessary and that ""no solution is possible without the departure of Bashar al-Assad."" Mr. Putin said sanctions did not work and that removing Mr. Assad was no panacea. ""Do you think that just by removing the president there will be happiness across the country?"" he said. ""Just look at what has happened in Libya.""   In Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement with a hard tone, blaming unspecified foreign countries for the Houla massacre, the worst known atrocity so far in the conflict. Apparently exonerating Mr. Assad of any responsibility for the 108 victims, half of them children, the statement said the killings ""showed what can result from supplying rebels with financial aid and smuggling modern weaponry to them, hiring foreign mercenaries and flirting with different kinds of extremists.""   Russia's resistance to pressure on Syria reflects an anger that has grown since the beginning of the Arab uprisings, which hard-liners in Moscow view as largely orchestrated by the West. They are particularly resentful over the case of Libya, in which Dmitri A. Medvedev, then the president, agreed not to block a Security Council resolution that provided the basis for NATO airstrikes and the violent death of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Mr. Putin fumed over the military campaign at the time, but was powerless to stop it.   ""If it hadn't been for Libya, maybe things would be different with Syria,"" said Georgy Mirsky, a leading Middle East scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. ""That was bad for the reputation of Medvedev, and Putin doesn't want to repeat that."" Mr. Mirsky said that Mr. Assad ""believes that time is working for him,"" and until that changed, ""It would be absolutely impossible for Russia to distance itself from him.""   Russia's support for Mr. Assad was evident in the debate on the Houla massacre at the United Nations Human Rights Council emergency meeting in Geneva, where members voted 41 to 3 in favor of authorizing an inquiry. Russia, China and Cuba, the dissident votes, called the move a pretext for laying the groundwork for foreign intervention.   While the inquiry adds to Mr. Assad's global isolation, it was still seen as a largely symbolic action because he has rejected the council's previous demands that its investigators be allowed to enter Syria.   The United States, Turkey and Qatar had been among the council members calling for a special session on Syria as part of their effort to pressure Mr. Assad. Although there was some thought of diluting the language to achieve a unanimous vote, diplomats said the main sponsors opted for a tougher line.   ""This was not just another incident in the conflict,"" Eileeen Donahoe, the American representative to the council, told reporters. ""It was an absolute abomination.""    Even as the debate on Houla was under way in Geneva, details emerged of a new massacre in Syria. Eleven bodies were found dumped in an orchard outside Qusair, a city controlled by the Free Syrian Army, the main anti-Assad armed group, and bore gunshot wounds that appeared to show that the dead had been summarily executed, said Salim Kabani, an activist in the city reached via Skype. Pictures of the men posted online showed that their hands had been bound.   The men were on a bus en route home from work at a fertilizer factory owned by the government just outside Qusair to the village of Buwayda, said Mr. Kabani, but they were stopped at a government-controlled checkpoint outside their village.   If the details are confirmed, it would be the third mass killing in a week, following the Houla massacre and the extrajudicial executions in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour of 13 electrical workers who activists said had refused to quit a sympathy strike over the Houla killings.   Intense discussions on Syria also continued between members of the Security Council in New York on how to salvage the cease-fire plan negotiated by Mr. Annan, which has basically been ignored since it took effect in mid-April. Mr. Annan, who was visiting with officials of neighboring Lebanon on Friday, expressed frustration.   ""I think perhaps I am more frustrated than most of you because I am in the thick of things,"" he said at a news conference in Beirut. ""We really want to see things move much faster.""

2640,2033175054.xml,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has long employed visual aids to drive home the dangers of Iran and the nuclear deal, even if those dangers are sometimes imagined.In February, Mr. Netanyahu brandished part of a  downed Iranian drone at a European security conference as a prop for his argument that Tehran and its proxies should not test his country's resolve. In a 2012 speech to the United Nations, he used a much-ridiculed cartoon of a bomb to measure Iran's nuclear capability, which, while advancing at the time, never reached the stage of producing a weapon.So far, these theatrical displays have failed to stop the nuclear deal that the Israeli leader despises. But Mr. Netanyahu's latest show and tell may have greater effect.In a  televised appearance on Monday, he presented images of thousands of nuclear-related documents stolen from Iran by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, along with a giant poster proclaiming ""Iran lied."" He argued that the documents proved Iranian leaders were deceptive when they insisted their nuclear program was for peaceful purposes.It didn't matter that the data simply reinforced what the world has long known: Iran lied about its program and hid it for years. In fact, Mr. Netanyahu confirmed what American intelligence agencies revealed in 2007: Iran had suspended the active portion of a nuclear weapons program in 2003.That program, along with related activities that continued after 2003, is a major reason the nuclear deal was struck in the first place and why its verification provisions are the most intrusive of any arms control agreement. It also explains why those provisions need to be retained, not jettisoned.Mr. Netanyahu did not provide any evidence that Iran had violated the deal since it took effect in early 2016. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the deal, has repeatedly judged Iran to be in compliance with its commitments, as have top American security officials. Many of Israel's past and present military and intelligence leaders also say the deal is effective and should be kept in force.But Mr. Netanyahu remains intent on killing it. President Trump is widely expected to try to do just that on May 12 by not waiving sanctions as the deal requires. Mr. Netanyahu was not leaving such an outcome to chance, however.Mr. Netanyahu made his televised plea -- in a style and format that Mr. Trump seems to prefer -- days after Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, made separate visits to Washington to implore Mr. Trump to adhere to the deal negotiated with Iran by Russia, China, Britain, the United States, France and Germany.The goal seemed to be threefold: emphasize Iranian perfidies in an effort to get Mr. Trump, with Congress's support, to scuttle the nuclear deal; signal to Tehran's government Israel's ability to penetrate its deepest secrets; and flaunt a major intelligence feat by Mossad.No matter how disingenuous it was, Mr. Netanyahu's data dump created the illusion of fresh incrimination, which the Trump White House indulged by issuing a statement that said Iran ""has a robust clandestine nuclear weapons program."" Only later did the White House correct that to read ""had"" a weapons program.Israel, the United States and gulf Arab states are right to be concerned about Iran's growing role in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and other regional hot spots. Some Iranian leaders have called for Israel's destruction, and the two adversaries have traded blows via proxies, cyberattacks and assassination squads since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The dangers of rising tensions in the Middle East were reaffirmed on Sunday when Israeli jets reportedly again struck Iranian targets in Syria, killing at least 16 people.Those alarm bells make maintaining the nuclear deal even more important. Mr. Trump could work with the Europeans on a plan to address such concerns as constraining Tehran's ballistic missile program, expanding inspections of nuclear facilities and curbing Iran's regional adventurism. Iran isn't the region's only destabilizing force. Withdrawing from the nuclear deal, thus freeing Iran to resume its nuclear activities and possibly provoking other countries to follow suit, would only make things worse.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

2195,434141789.xml,"      Dress rehearsals are well under way for the Group of 8 summit meeting that opens here on Wednesday, but whether the production is comedy, tragedy or the serious undertaking Italy hopes for may depend on the host: The gathering is set in an earthquake zone still beset by tremors and is being organized by a prime minister fending off a soap operatic sex scandal.   Since Friday, four new earthquakes have shaken L'Aquila, the central Italian city where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi moved the meeting in solidarity after a devastating quake here on April 6 killed nearly 300 people and left 65,000 others homeless.    After a quake measuring a magnitude of 4.1 on Friday sent frightened residents into the streets, the government announced a ""Plan B,"" in which world leaders would be evacuated by helicopter to Rome to continue meeting if a serious quake struck.    Participants hope the seismic activity will cooperate for Mr. Berlusconi. ""That really depends on God almighty,"" said Sergio Romano, a former Italian ambassador to NATO. ""We'll see whether he's on his side.""    But Mr. Berlusconi is under pressure in other ways. Ever since his wife said in May that she was divorcing him, calling him ""unwell"" and accusing him of gallivanting with young women, including a teenager, new questions have continued to emerge about Mr. Berlusconi's personal life, including whether high-end escorts were paid to attend parties at his official Rome residence.    Juicy photos have also appeared, including images of attractive young women frolicking in the nude -- or scantily clad on a merry-go-round -- during parties at Mr. Berlusconi's Sardinian villa.    Through it all, Mr. Berlusconi has remained defiant. ""This is how I am,"" he said last month. ""I'm not going to change a thing. If they like me this way, they like me this way.""    Indeed, a well-regarded poll last week found that the prime minister's approval ratings had fallen only two points since the scandal began in May, to 49 percent, with his popularity dropping most among women and practicing Roman Catholics.    Mr. Berlusconi is famous for his ebullient personality and off-color jokes -- he has repeatedly called President Obama ""young, handsome and suntanned"" -- but news reports say his advisers are urging him to tone things down.    ""Those student-like jokes that he likes to play, like stepping in front of Angela Merkel from behind the monument, he better not do that,"" Mr. Romano said, referring to the German chancellor, whom Mr. Berlusconi is fond of teasing.    Analysts wonder whether new allegations against the prime minister will emerge during the meeting of the  Group of 8, representing major  economies, just as they did in 1994, the year he first took office, when he  was told that he was under investigation for questionable finances while he was holding a United Nations conference on crime.    Mr. Berlusconi had originally planned to host the Group of 8 on La Maddalena, an island off the coast of Sardinia, where the delegations were to be housed on a luxury cruise ship. But when the earthquake struck here on April 6, he had a new idea -- to move the meeting to L'Aquila in solidarity with residents and in keeping with the less luxe spirit of the financial crisis.    Workmen have been laboring around the clock to transform a vast Finance Police school into the summit meeting headquarters from Wednesday through Friday. World leaders, including Mr. Obama, and their delegations are expected to be housed in apartments on the grounds. The local airport has been expanded and a press center built to accommodate more than 3,000 accredited journalists. The surrounding area has been turned into a ""red zone,"" patrolled by thousands of security officers.    Since the recent quakes, authorities have assured expected  guests that the venue is sound. But they have also devised an evacuation plan in case of quakes of more than a magnitude of 4, in which people would be sent to tents until the buildings were deemed safe to re-enter. If delegations choose to leave, they will get a police escort back to Rome.   The choice of venue is ""an important way to bring the most powerful in the world to the most weak,"" said Guido Bertolaso, the head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, who is overseeing the rebuilding efforts and the Group of 8 meeting arrangements.    Indeed, just a few miles from the meeting headquarters, thousands of homeless earthquake victims are still living in tents, awaiting housing that the government has pledged to build by fall. The area's economy has been devastated, with businesses, city offices, schools and the university in ruins.    Some residents are not thrilled that the Group of 8 is coming to town. ""I don't know how good a choice it was,"" said Chiara di Crosta, 33, as she looked after her young daughter in a tent camp in downtown L'Aquila on a recent afternoon. ""There are more fundamental questions, like houses.""   Yet Italy hopes the venue will help bring in international financing. The Culture Ministry has singled out 45 monuments, including L'Aquila's most notable churches, that it hopes different countries will ""adopt"" for restoration.    Memories are still raw from the last time Italy hosted the Group of 8, in Genoa in 2001, when one 23-year-old was killed and dozens of people were injured when the police cracked down on protesters. This time, Group of 8 protesters are holding a series of rallies in other cities ahead of the meeting.    Stefano Frezza, a spokesman for Epicentro Solidale, the L'Aquila-based group coordinating the protests, said the protests in L'Aquila should be peaceful.

2861,1561407015.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  The United States and Europe agreed on Thursday to place additional economic sanctions on Russia over its role in promoting separatist warfare in eastern Ukraine despite a fragile new cease-fire that went into effect last week. European leaders overcame resistance among some of their colleagues who wanted to continue delaying additional measures to see if the shaky truce, negotiated in Minsk, Belarus, holds. President Obama then followed suit shortly afterward by announcing that he would match the new European moves when they take effect on Friday. ""We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the cease-fire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine,"" Mr. Obama said. He added: ""If Russia fully implements its commitments, these sanctions can be rolled back. If instead Russia continues its aggressive actions and violations of international law, the costs will continue to rise."" Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, the body representing the European Union's leaders, said the sanctions to be put into effect on Friday would be reviewed by diplomats before the end of the month and could be revised swiftly if events warranted. ""We have always stressed the reversibility and scalability of our restrictive measures,"" he said. Neither side publicly announced the specific actions to be taken, leaving that until Friday, but officials said they would be aimed at Russia's financial, energy and defense sectors.  Both the United States and Europe will further restrict Russian access to credit markets for loans maturing in more than 30 days, according to officials briefed on the plans. The United States will add Sberbank, Russia's largest, to its list of institutions subject to the limits, according to the officials. The United States and Europe will both further tighten restrictions first imposed in July on the export of energy technology that would help Russia develop its Arctic, deep sea and shale oil reserves, officials said. Europe will ban 24 more Russian officials from traveling to its member states and freeze any assets held there, according to a diplomat familiar with the plan. The Kremlin lost no time in vowing to retaliate.  Although Russian officials did not announce any specifics, they have previously threatened to ban flights by Western airlines over Russian airspace, potentially closing off an enormous stretch of territory and forcing costly detours for long-haul flights between Europe and eastern Asia. Andrey Belousov, a senior economic aide to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, said Thursday that another response might be to ban imports of automobiles to Russia, which is a huge market for used cars from Europe and Japan. ""We have a full series of nonagricultural products, where our, above all European, partners depend more on Russia, than Russia on them,"" Mr. Belousov said at an economic forum in the Russian city of Samara, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""This concerns, for instance, the import of automobiles, above all, used cars."" Russia has already banned a variety of food and agricultural imports, including meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Australia, Canada and Norway, as retaliation for earlier rounds of sanctions. A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Aleksandr Lukashevich, denounced the new Western sanctions at a briefing in Moscow. He accused Russia's critics of using the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine as a pretext for inflicting unjustified economic harm on Russia. The United States has generally been more aggressive than Europe in seeking to penalize Russia for its role in Ukraine. European nations have tended to move more guardedly, in part because they have closer economic ties to Russia and European businesses have more to lose in the event of retaliation by Moscow. During deliberations among the Europeans on the latest round of sanctions, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany argued vociferously in favor of moving ahead without waiting to see if the cease-fire would hold. American officials said Russia still had 1,000 troops inside Ukraine and that Moscow had made it clear it had no intention of reversing its annexation of Crimea. While Ms. Merkel prevailed, the provisional nature of the European Union's action was underscored at a news briefing, when a European official detailed how the sanctions would be reviewed for possible revision or repeal almost from the moment they are imposed. ""The work will start pretty soon,"" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity before the formal publication of the sanctions. The official would not give an estimate of how long the review would take, but said, ""I think that the bulk of the work is expected to be done through the month of September."" All 28 member nations would have to agree on any changes. The official said good news from Ukraine might make the decision easier: ""We have seen the first positive steps that could pave the way in what we are hoping could become a sustainable political solution, but at the moment this is still very much a developing situation.""

77,1448511544.xml,"       BERLIN --  A German government that has for years preached austerity as the sole path to prosperity, both at home and abroad, is poised to break open its pocketbook. As Chancellor Angela Merkel, known for her insistence on fiscal rectitude, negotiates for her third term with her only viable coalition partner, the Social Democrats, she is being pushed to accept a range of leftist policies that would sharply increase government spending. Among the measures being demanded are a minimum wage -- the country's first -- of $11.50 an hour, equal pensions in the east and the west, equal pay for men and women, higher child care payments, a tax increase for the wealthy, and sharply increased funding for infrastructure, education and energy. There is little change for the moment in Germany's attitude toward its neighbors. While Greece, Italy, Spain and even France are hacking away at long-cherished parts of their social safety net to meet the demands of Berlin and their international creditors, Ms. Merkel, a conservative, and her unyielding finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, are resisting any sort of redistribution of funds within the euro zone. Berlin's attention to its own domestic priorities seems likely to stir resentment that the medicine of austerity prescribed by Berlin abroad is administered with less zeal at home. Analysts say the contrast is angering voters throughout Europe, where populist and anti-European Union parties are steadily gaining strength outside Germany. From the German perspective, years of frugality and sacrifice have led to a strong economy, a full treasury and predicted budget surpluses to the end of Ms. Merkel's next four-year term in 2017. What Berlin is demanding of its European partners, German officials are quick to say, is that they do much the same for themselves. ""The Germans say to themselves, 'We are a family, and the other Europeans are distant relatives,' "" said Jürgen W. Falter, a professor of political science at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. ""In a family, you stand together; distant relatives, you help when you can."" It is a sentiment widely shared across the German political spectrum. Since Ms. Merkel rose in the ranks of the conservative Christian Democrats in the 1990s, she has already moved her party well to the left. That shift helped cement her election victory in September, when the results showed that Germans voters wanted center-left policies, but run by the nominally conservative chancellor. Reviving her partnership with the Social Democrats, with whom Ms. Merkel governed in her first term, from 2005 to 2009, implies a further shift to the left in a country where most people expect the state to assist in times of need, and the gap between rich and poor -- while widening -- is narrower than in the United States or even Britain. In this move, Ms. Merkel is being pushed by domestic pressures to adopt policies that would actually be welcomed by most economists, the United States Treasury and many leading European officials. They have long argued that Germany needs to balance growth in the euro zone by stimulating domestic demand and reducing its dependence on exports. For years, Ms. Merkel has rebutted that reasoning, saying each country has to keep its own fiscal house in order. But under pressure from domestic politics, she appears to be easing up.  Ms. Merkel has also pledged to help others in Europe, especially in alleviating youth unemployment and building a European future by investing in research and training. But the Social Democrats want her to go even further, arguing for more aid to the poorer European countries as well as more spending at home.  Much speculation in the current coalition talks, then, has revolved around whether Ms. Merkel's partners will demand to take over the Finance Ministry, now run by Mr. Schäuble, a passionate European who has come to personify Germany's austerity policies on the Continent. It is one place where Ms. Merkel could draw a line, as she and her inner circle seem to feel vindicated by glimmers of growth in weaker European countries, crediting the austerity policies they have advocated. Even if the Social Democrats gained control of the Finance Ministry, it would not necessarily signal a major change in Berlin's policies toward the rest of Europe, given the broad support in Germany for Ms. Merkel's handling of the euro crisis, analysts have said. Whether the Social Democrats can persuade Ms. Merkel in particular and Germans more broadly to free up funds for the rest of Europe -- or at least lighten Berlin's demands for greater budget rigor among its European Union partners -- is hardly clear, even as the widening gap between Germany's strength and that of its partners becomes an increasingly pressing issue for the union's long-term health. If there is no attempt to redistribute income at the European level, then ""the imbalance in Europe will only increase,"" said Nils Diederich, a politics and social sciences professor at the Free University in Berlin. And that could work against Germany's interests in the long term, analysts say. Germany has prospered in recent years, as Ms. Merkel and many analysts acknowledge, in part because the euro is undervalued relative to the German economy and its export success, and overvalued relative to the economies of nations to the south, such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Germany, in contrast to its partners in the bloc, boasts that it has never had so many people working and contributing to tax and welfare systems -- just over 42 million. In September alone, the government said, it collected 55 billion euros in taxes, about $75 billion. While sovereign debt has soared since the early 2000s, it is, at around 80 percent of gross domestic product, less of a share of national wealth than in the United States, France or Britain. Yet politicians of all stripes and, not least, voters have come around to the notion that Germany has put off too many of its own needs for too long while the euro crisis has absorbed the chancellor's attention. To judge by the political theater since the Sept. 22 elections, domestic spending will take precedence, and many economists say that after years of austerity, a loosening of the purse strings here is long overdue. A recent study said that Germany would have to spend more than [euro]100 billion, or about $135 billion, over the next 15 years just to repair its existing stock of roads, bridges and railways, which in populous areas of western Germany have been neglected for years. With an average of 1.4 children per woman -- 2.1 is the replacement rate -- Germany needs to find ways to make life easier for working women. Ms. Merkel, listing her priorities for a third term -- when she is expected to be increasingly conscious of her legacy -- included a strong and durable European Union. But her other priorities underscored her desire to leave behind a stronger Germany, too. That richer, stronger Germany may act as a locomotive for the rest of Europe, increasing imports and perhaps even migrant flows from France, Italy, Spain or elsewhere. But demands on Germany for greater sharing, despite Berlin's attachment to austerity policies for the union broadly, are only likely to increase. From Rome, Roberto d'Alimonte, a political science professor at Luiss Guido Carli University, expressed little doubt that Germany would eventually have to redistribute wealth in Europe, not just at home, if for no other reason than to secure its own standing. ""What place in history can Germany have without Europe?"" he asked in a telephone interview. ""A community of values has to include also some kind of solidarity. Because without that, it will not survive.""

752,1639820850.xml,"       PARIS --  From the kitchen of the luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the Michelin two-star chef Thierry Marx is waging a mini-campaign against culinary racism. He is making kebabs. In recent months, officials of the far right National Front have attacked the kebab, France's most popular fast-food import from the East. For them, the proliferation of shops selling hunks of meat roasting on a spit is nothing less than a threat to the country's identity.  ""I grew up in a rough neighborhood of Paris with 100 nationalities of immigrants,"" said Mr. Marx, who also runs a school for street chefs in eastern Paris. ""Sometimes people give me a hard time when I cook like this. But for me, symbols are important. Street food is the driving force of integration.""  Mr. Marx's kebabs, which he sometimes serves at Sunday brunch, are more designer than street in style. They involve shaping pieces of saddle of lamb rolled in bread crumbs and cumin into slim cones, filled with chopped dried fruit and herbs and sautéed in butter and oil. He serves them with hummus the consistency of peanut butter, yogurt sauce topped with chopped cucumber, a semolina grain and puffy pita bread.  Kebabaphobia surfaced in France in far-right-wing blogs in 2013 and as a campaign issue in local elections and elections for the European Parliament last spring.  ""This attack has nothing to do with gastronomy,"" said Philippe Faure, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of promoting French tourism and cuisine. ""It is the manipulation of food for political ends. It is racism, pure and simple."" As a candidate for mayor of the southern city Béziers, Robert Ménard, a co-founder of the Boulevard Voltaire website, evoked nostalgia for a bygone ""traditional"" era in France. In 2013, the website published an article imagining what France will look like in the year 2047. All the women were wearing headscarves, and kebabs had replaced traditional baguettes. The opening of kebab shops ""is too often accompanied by beards and veils,"" the article said. After he won the election, Mr. Ménard gave City Hall first rights over the purchase of any business that closes down in the historic center as a way to limit the proliferation of kebab shops. ""I want to be able to choose what shops will open in the center of the city,"" he said in a phone interview. ""French people are attached to their history, their culture. When the presence of foreigners is too visible, people feel threatened. Too many kebab shops are a threat to the historical image and the identity of the city."" The anti-kebab movement has not been endorsed by the National Front leader, Marine Le Pen; she prefers to stay above the fray when it comes to France's culture wars. But the victory of 12 National Front-supported candidates in mayoral elections last spring has emboldened some of them to use food as a political weapon.  During the local election in the southern town Beaucaire, the National Front candidate Julien Sanchez complained that there were four kebab shops in the historic city center. He pledged that if he were elected, his City Hall would use its authority to block new ""communitarian"" businesses from opening.  After he won the mayoral election, The Associated Press quoted him as saying that the police would patrol kebab shops to ensure they weren't fronts for illegal activities.  In the Loire Valley city Blois, several kebab shops have opened in recent months in the historic city center, the site of the centuries-old chateau that was home to seven kings and 10 queens. Blois's National Front party regional secretary, Michel Chassier, is hoping to make some of the shops go away. ""These places are incompatible with the image of Blois as a jewel of French history that attracts tourists from around the world,"" Mr. Chassier said in a telephone interview. ""Little by little, Blois is becoming a mundane, globalized place.""  Mr. Chassier paints an even darker picture of the kebab shop. ""Are certain of them a cover for money laundering?"" he asked. ""I don't frequent them, of course, but there is the issue of hygiene."" Despite efforts like these, there is no evidence that the kebab industry is in decline. According to the market research company Gira Conseil, about 300 million kebabs are eaten a year in more than 10,000 outlets in France. Kebabs are third to only hamburgers and pizza in the fast-food diet of the French.  The kebab that the far right is targeting is different from the one Mr. Marx makes in his kitchen at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It is the basic Turkish doner kebab -- a gyro in the United States. It is tightly flattened layers of meat (veal, chicken, turkey or lamb, or a combination) carved off a vertical rotating spit. It is served with chopped salad and a sauce in a flatbread (customers choose their own sauce), with or without a side of fries.  The doner kebab was introduced into France in the late 1980s by Turkish immigrants. It was popularized and transformed by France's much larger North African population, which was accustomed to grilled meats served with flatbread.  But it has retained its reputation as takeout food -- cheap and fast -- prepared and served from small shops that require little investment, equipment or training of personnel. It is rarely considered French.  In Germany, by contrast, with its large ethnic Turkish population, the doner kebab has been so integrated into the country's cuisine that there are more kebab stands in Berlin than in Istanbul. Chancellor Angela Merkel has been photographed several times slicing giant kebabs.  And in Britain, the country's kebab industry is recognized by the annual British Kebab Awards, whose judges include members of Parliament. Among the awards are ""best takeaway kebab shop in London"" and ""best newcomer kebab restaurant."" At Anatolie, a sit-down Turkish restaurant in the Paris suburb Montreuil, Philippe Celik, the owner, and his staff of five serve a dozen different kebabs, including doner, shish and kefte. Mr. Celik has been in the restaurant business since he came to Paris from the Kurdish region of Turkey in 1989.  ""There will always be stereotypes attached to foreigners -- 'Oh, the Kurds are from the mountains and the Sicilians are from the Mafia,' "" Mr. Celik said. ""But who built this country? Who were the construction workers? It was the foreigners.""  The upscale butcher Hugo Desnoyer joined with a French chef and another French partner to open Le Grillé on the Right Bank of Paris in 2013. It serves ""luxury kebabs,"" including one made with milk-fed veal.  Since 2012, the Kebab Academy in the Normandy city St.-Lo has trained students in the craft of kebab making. One of its students last year was a 33-year-old butcher from Chengdu, China.  ""For the French, the kebab attracts with its exoticism, low cost and ease of eating, even when you're walking on the street, "" said Pierre Raffard, a French scholar of Turkish cuisine. ""It's a nomad product that won't go away. ""For the right, the kebab has become a symbol of the invasion of Muslims in France. It is a powerful way to attack. What you eat is who you are. You are touching the most sensitive point of identity.""  Credit: ELAINE SCIOLINO; Assia Labbas contributed reporting.

1427,1438516501.xml,"       ROME --  For two decades, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has not just led Italy's powerful center-right political movement; he has practically owned it. A billionaire media mogul, he has bankrolled campaigns and vetted his party's candidates. His power has been so absolute that even at age 77, he still has not truly groomed a successor. But now with Italy facing a new political crisis that could threaten the relative stability of the battered 17-nation euro zone, Mr. Berlusconi, who must begin serving a sentence for tax fraud this month, could be facing a full-blown rebellion. Crucial lieutenants are balking at his effort to bring down Italy's fragile coalition government, and Mr. Berlusconi's actions are increasingly viewed as those of a desperate man willing to do almost anything to save himself. The showdown will come on Wednesday in Italy's Parliament, where Prime Minister Enrico Letta is expected to call for a government confidence vote after Mr. Berlusconi tried to bring down the government last weekend by ordering the five ministers from his party to quit the coalition. The ministers did so, but not happily, and Mr. Letta has since rejected the resignations. Now, several center-right lawmakers, including the five ministers, have signaled they will support the government in the confidence vote, but, in doing so, buck their leader, Mr. Berlusconi, who wants fresh elections. ""This is a major, major political development,"" said Franco Pavoncello, president of John Cabot University in Rome and an expert on Italian politics. ""This is a split."" Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake, but analysts agree that much is at stake now. European leaders are desperate to maintain stability and regard Italy with concern, since it has the third-largest economy on the Continent and is mired in a prolonged recession. Germany's prime minister, Angela Merkel, called Mr. Letta on Monday to offer her support, while Olli Rehn, vice president of the European Commission, also expressed concern. ""What happens in the country doesn't stop at its borders but is felt throughout the European Union,"" Mr. Rehn said, according to Ansa, an Italian news agency. ""So my hope is for the return of political stability as soon as possible in order to take the decisions necessary for the return of growth and employment."" But also hanging in the balance is the long reign of Mr. Berlusconi in Italian politics. His charisma, money and political savvy have held the center right together for years, analysts say. He has said that he is now leaving the government because Mr. Letta has done too little to roll back a new value-added tax. But most analysts believe he is maneuvering to escape his latest and most serious legal troubles, which are threatening to end his career and endanger his business empire after two decades of largely dodging sex and corruption scandals. His recent conviction on tax fraud means that he must begin a one-year sentence on Oct. 15 (he is expected to serve it under house arrest). On Friday, a special Senate commission will resume deliberations to expel him from his current Senate seat. And a court in Milan is expected to soon decide how many years Mr. Berlusconi will be banned from seeking public office, based on his tax fraud conviction. A fine of about 500 million euros was upheld against his financial empire. His loyalists have blamed a politically biased judiciary for his troubles, but they have been divided on how to respond. Some party insiders say that Mr. Berlusconi is deeply concerned that should he be expelled from the Senate -- and thus stripped of certain parliamentary privileges against prosecution -- he would be more vulnerable to other investigations against him. In ordering his ministers to step down last weekend, Mr. Berlusconi sided with hawks in his camp who have pushed him to remove his party's support from the coalition government and force new elections to win a public mandate. But another camp has been increasingly vocal that bringing down the government would be irresponsible and could lead to a trouncing at the polls. By late Tuesday, it seemed likely that Mr. Berlusconi's followers would splinter, after a long meeting concluded with Mr. Berlusconi still pushing for a no-confidence vote, according to Ansa. Many of his supporters were signaling that they would back the government.  After meeting with Mr. Berlusconi earlier in the day, Angelino Alfano, a longtime ally and the deputy prime minister in the coalition government, announced on his Facebook page that he hoped the entire party would support the government. Others voiced similar sentiments, with predictions that Mr. Berlusconi might lose dozens of members of his party, or more. Mr. Berlusconi had already met with leaders of his party on Monday night, seeking unity. Instead, fissures became obvious; when one party leader, Fabrizio Cicchitto, tried to voice dissent, Mr. Berlusconi ignored him, Italian news outlets reported. ""I hope that we will correct the political error we made withdrawing the ministers and that we go forward so that there is a government,"" Mr. Cicchitto said on Tuesday, according to Ansa. The pressure on Mr. Berlusconi to reverse course -- or for his followers to desert him -- is coming from many directions. Business leaders have warned that the Italian economy could suffer another blow, even as new statistics show that industrial production is slumping and youth unemployment has topped 40 percent. Moreover, Italy must complete a budget plan by the middle of month so that it can be submitted to Brussels for approval. Missing this deadline could bring serious penalties from European officials and damage Italian credibility. Meanwhile, many of Mr. Berlusconi's supporters are conservative Roman Catholics, and the Vatican's newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, published a blistering front-page editorial that said provoking the crisis was ""irresponsible"" and could damage ""the credibility of the entire Italian political class."" Mr. Berlusconi has almost never been challenged within his own movement. Gianfranco Fini, a former ally, left him three years ago to form a moderate party, but has largely disappeared, at least politically. ""On the center-right, you don't have a party,"" said Sergio Fabbrini, a leading political analyst in Rome. ""You have a personal company.""

1802,2399048293.xml,"Europe's largest democracy is now confident enough to lift most restrictions on businesses and schools.BERLIN -- Germany was a leader in the West in taking on the coronavirus pandemic, and then a leader in the calibrated restarting of public life. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel had a hopeful message for the nation: The experiment was working.The infection numbers, Ms. Merkel announced, were not just stable but lower than those reported two weeks ago. ""We have reached the goal of slowing the spread of the virus, of protecting our health care system from being overwhelmed,"" the chancellor said at a news conference.Germany, she said, was now in a position to reopen most aspects of its economy and society. ""We can afford a little audacity,"" Ms. Merkel said.It was good news not only for Germany, but countries eager for a sign that life can continue with the virus. Coming on a day when the European Union announced that the economies sharing the euro would face a deep recession this year, it also raised hopes that success in Germany might help blunt the downturn.Germany's progress demonstrated that a combination of cautious, science-led political leadership and a regime of widespread testing, tracing and social distancing could allow countries to manage a controlled reopening.But it was also a stark reminder of the differences  in other Western countries.In the United States, some states have tried restarting but faced chaos and disputes with Washington, while cases and deaths are still rising.Spain, which currently has the highest number of cases in Europe, has abandoned the idea of sending children back to school until September. In neighboring France, President Emmanuel Macron may lift stay-at-home orders on Monday, but cafes and bars will remain closed.Germany shut down early and has been systematically testing its way back to some semblance of normality. That is not to say that life with the virus will look anything like before.Face masks, already mandatory in shops and public transport across Germany, are fast becoming the new normal, seen everywhere from street protests to shop-window mannequins.Socializing, even at restaurants and bars now allowed to reopen, will be limited to two households, six feet apart.But with those limitations in place,  Ms. Merkel on Wednesday restored many freedoms shelved for the best part of two months.All shops will be allowed to reopen. Restaurants and hotels can resume in time for two long holiday weekends at the end of May.All school children will see a classroom again before the summer holidays. Day care centers will start taking children next week, focusing on families most in need. Residents in nursing and care homes can receive visits from one person.And crucially in this nation of soccer fans: The Bundesliga, Germany's professional league, will play again -- albeit in empty stadiums.Ms. Merkel struck a characteristically sober tone on Wednesday, warning that the freedoms could be quickly squandered by irresponsible behavior.""We can say today that the first phase of the pandemic is behind us,"" the chancellor said. ""But we have to be aware that we are still in the beginning of the pandemic and that we will have to deal with this virus for a long time.""Details of how and when to lift individual restrictions on everything from cinemas and tattoo parlors to brothels is now up to the governors of Germany's 16 states.Whether the chancellor can maintain the political climate of unity that did much to underpin the trust citizens have in the government's handling of the pandemic remains uncertain.""The whole federal republic,"" Ms. Merkel stressed on Wednesday, after meeting with state governors over video conference, ""is built on trust.""There were some signs this week that the unity was fraying, with several governors rushing to stake out measures particularly important to their regions before that meeting.The coastal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, heavily dependent on tourism and with one of the lowest infection levels, announced Tuesday that restaurants would be allowed to open from Wednesday, followed by hotels on May 25.Bavaria, with a higher case density, said on Tuesday that beer gardens and restaurants with terraces would resume by May 18 but hotels would remain closed until month's end.Days earlier, the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt formally increased the number of people from different households allowed to gather in public from two to five.Some welcomed the return of a more vibrant political debate, arguing that not just the economy but democracy, too, needed reviving after fundamental freedoms had been curtailed. As the  crisis mode morphed into longer-term pandemic management, a one-size-fits all response was no longer suitable.Ms. Merkel acknowledged that different regions in Germany had varying infection levels and should tailor their responses.But she also announced an ""emergency mechanism"" that requires any region where  new daily infections exceed 50 per 100,000 inhabitants for seven days to reinstate restrictions until that number falls below 50 for seven days.""If locally something happens, we won't wait until it has spread through the whole republic but we act locally,"" she said.Germany conducts about 142,000 coronavirus tests a day, and has begun several random antibody tests nationwide. New daily infections have been steadily falling, dropping below 1,000 last week for the first time in more than six weeks.Pending the introduction of a Europe-wide tracing app, a project troubled by delays and disagreements, hundreds of newly trained health officers are working the phones to trace and inform anyone who may have come into contact with a newly infected person in order to halt the chain of infection.The reproduction factor, a variable that measures how many people are infected by each new case, has hovered around 0.7, meaning that three newly infected people infect fewer than two.Ms. Merkel -- whose video explanation two weeks ago of why this variable was crucial in monitoring the pandemic went viral -- has long said that a value below 1 meant the health care system can cope.Four in five of Germany's 164,807 known cases of infection have recovered and less than 7,000 people have died, a far lower death toll than in many neighbors, according to the country's version of the Centers for Disease Control, the Robert Koch Institute.""Together we have won a great success,"" Lothar Wieler, the institute's president, said this week. ""If we defend it well, then the numbers will stay low.""""Keeping your distance is certainly the new everyday reality,"" he added.Germans have grown accustomed to keeping six feet apart in public. As the country opens up, strict social distancing rules will remain in force.Schools are scrambling to halve class sizes, stagger the start and end of classes, and enforce rigorous hygiene rules. Many shops have put disinfectant at the door, plexiglass at the cashier and floor markings to control customer queues.One area with no reopening in sight for now is large public event space. Concerts, spectator sporting events and festivals are banned until at least Aug. 31.Even Germany risks  a second wave of infections, experts warn. The virus has a two-week incubation period and can be transmitted by asymptomatic people, making monitoring difficult.""When you loosen measures, the problem is that you only see the effect in two weeks,"" said Thomas Hotz, a mathematician who has been modeling the reproduction number of the virus. ""And when you do it too quickly then you could see the virus reproducing too quickly.""""Our advantage in Germany is that we managed to depress our infection numbers so much that we have a lot of spare capacity in hospitals,"" he continued.Unlike the United States, he said, ""We can afford to experiment.""Christopher F.

3842,2281006520.xml,"PARIS -- President Emmanuel Macron of France seemed to be everywhere at once during the Group of 7 summit. For the space of a weekend, at least, the West appeared to have one person running the show, and it was not the American president.One day, Mr. Macron was wooing President Trump over a long, private lunch. The next he was flying in the Iranian foreign minister for unannounced talks. He seized the role as chief defender of the global climate, telling Brazilians to get themselves a new president. He prompted a surprise diplomatic opening on Iran from Mr. Trump, even if both initiatives hit early headwinds on Tuesday.Mr. Macron missed no opportunity to wring every advantage from his role as host of the summit in the southern resort city of Biarritz. It gave him the perfect stage to pursue his ambition, both grandiose and self-serving, to position France, and himself, as candidates to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Trump's retreat from traditional Western values.With Mr. Trump deepening American isolation on major global issues, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on a glide path out of power, Mr. Macron has become the leading champion of European unity and multilateralism.Mr. Macron clearly wanted to use the Group of 7 forum to show the world that neither are dead letters. He also wanted to show off himself.[President Trump's changing approach to the trade war has left much of the world off balance. Read more here.]The Élysée Palace offered several news outlets behind-the-scenes access to the French president during the summit. Mr. Macron organized the events to avoid the missteps that have produced undiplomatic outbursts from Mr. Trump in the past.His lunch with Mr. Trump on Day 1 established that this forum was for two leaders as much as it was for seven, as did the leaders' joint news conference at the summit's end. Those touches went far in sating the American president's ego, even as they effectively elevated the two men to the status of first among equals.But Mr. Macron's objective appeared to be not so much showing up his American counterpart as reasserting the efficacy of the European approach to global problems.He said as much last week, telling journalists that the summit was a way to demonstrate that the ""European civilization project"" was an ""answer"" in a world searching for ""global stability.""""If we can't redefine the terms of our sovereignty, we can't defend our project,"" Mr. Macron said to reporters before leaving for Biarritz. ""Man is at the heart of the project,"" he said, adding that the ""relationship to the dignity of man, to humanism"" was ""the foundation of European civilization.""In the context of global diplomacy, that means eschewing the threats, bullying and humiliation favored by Mr. Trump and what Mr. Macron called the ""nationalist-sovereignists"" in favor of multilateral diplomacy and a refusal to demonize adversaries.Mr. Macron's domestic stock, only lately creeping up after being battered by  months of Yellow Vest protests, has improved further after what the French media characterized as a successful summit.He ""managed to be at the forefront and sometimes at the center of some of the hottest diplomatic issues of the day,"" said Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.Mr. Macron came out of the Group of 7 meeting ""as well as any head of state can,"" Mr. Tertrais said, adding that he had ""appeared as someone who can achieve results on the key multilateral issues.""""It does establish its credentials as a global leader for multilateralism and liberal values,"" Mr. Tertrais said of the summit. ""I'm actually quite favorably impressed.""Not everyone was as enamored of the presumptive French role, however. Early in the weekend Mr. Trump's aides complained that the agenda that Mr. Macron set focused more on what they called ""niche issues"" like climate change than on global economic challenges.In a dispute that has grown personal, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil demanded an apology from Mr. Macron on Tuesday before he said Brazil could consider an aid package of more than $22 million to fight fires in the Amazon offered by leaders at the summit.Last week, Mr. Bolsonaro mocked Mr. Macron's wife and said the French president was treating Brazil ""as if we were a colony."" Mr. Macron had responded by saying that he hoped Brazilians would soon get a ""president who behaves properly.""There was also little doubt that, try as he might to play the role of global standard-bearer, Mr. Macron would not get far without allies -- particularly on issues like trade and climate change -- and that their ranks were thinning.Mr. Macron ""seemed dynamic,"" but relatively alone, said Nicolas Tenzer, who teaches at Sciences Po, a leading university for political science in Paris.Mr. Tenzer said that Mr. Macron had ""a better grasp of the issues"" than Mr. Trump or Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, but added that, with the German chancellor nearing the end of her tenure, ""he's the only one.""""It's a great advantage, and also a source of solitude.""On the Iranian question in particular, Mr. Macron appeared to be nudging Mr. Trump in a new direction.He got Mr. Trump to accept the surprise visit of an Iranian official, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in the midst of a conflict that has escalated in recent months with a string of episodes involving oil tankers and drones near Iran.He even got Mr. Trump to agree, in principle, to a possible meeting with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. Such a meeting would be the first between American and Iranian leaders since the Tehran hostage crisis of 1979-81, though Mr. Rouhani said that he would not sit down with Mr. Trump until Washington ended its economic sanctions.""It's the beginning of something,"" Mr. Macron said.Mr. Macron was careful to offer guarded praise for the American position, which he said ""creates pressure, and conditions for a better agreement."" And he got Mr. Trump to say he was against ""regime change"" in Iran, reassuring European officials who have been worried about the worst for months.On the economic front, Mr. Macron said a major issue for him was ""Can we pacify international commerce?""It was ""an error in reasoning"" to engage in ""commercial war and isolationism,"" Mr. Macron said. And again, he got Mr. Trump to sound notes on the trade war that were far more conciliatory toward China than over preceding days.It was in his handling of Mr. Trump, the declared enemy of multilateralism and unabashed wrecker of summits, that Mr. Macron showed his greatest agility.[World leaders have taken to soft-pedaling disagreements with Mr. Trump. Read more here.]The relationship has had its ups and downs over the last two years, with the French president's early efforts  to woo his  American counterpart proving spectacularly unsuccessful and eroding his popularity back home.The leaders clashed as recently as November, when Mr. Macron denounced nationalism in a speech at events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and Mr. Trump responded with a scathing series of Twitter posts that highlighted the French leader's low approval rating.This time was different. Mr. Macron's technique was evident as the two men stood side by side at the final news conference: Mr. Macron appeared always respectful, sharply curbing his own tendency for long-winded, abstract explanations that might have irritated Mr. Trump.Nor did Mr. Macron launch into the numbing detail on secondary issues with which he battered French journalists at a later news conference. And he went out of his way to praise a leader who has been openly mocked by a number of his counterparts.""We've worked very closely, with lots of energy, with President Trump these last days,"" Mr. Macron said at the news conference. ""And we're going to continue to work together in the coming months. We'll be side by side in all of these fights.""That one-on-one lunch he organized for Mr. Trump -- aides only joined at the end -- that evidently went far to mollify the American president. Mr. Trump spoke effusively about the meeting afterward.""We had a lunch that lasted for quite a while, just the two of us,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It was the best period of time we've ever had. We weren't trying to impress anybody, just each other.""President Emmanuel Macron showed agility in dealing with President Trump.

3469,1801313294.xml,"       WHEN my aunt Eunice Kennedy Shriver died in 2009, more than a few people wondered aloud why she hadn't run for president, as three of her brothers did. By then, we had women on the Supreme Court, women as senators, representatives and governors. One woman had even come close to winning her party's presidential nomination. But when my aunt was young, she saw no women in elective roles, and what she could not see, she wasn't encouraged to be. Even now, among dozens of Kennedy cousins in the next generation, I am the only woman who has sought or held elective office. What is a female candidate supposed to look like? Act like? Be? These are tough questions for Americans to answer, especially when we're so quick to recycle outmoded gender perceptions when women try to talk to us about why and how they want to lead. As Hillary Clinton prepares to accept the Democratic nomination for president, Americans are long overdue for what George H. W. Bush once contemptuously called ""the vision thing."" Only this time it's about envisioning women as leaders. Why should one more woman have to contend with the conventional daily diet of criticism fed to me as a woman campaigning for political office? When I first ran for Congress in the mid-1980s, I received unending commentary about my hair, just as Mrs. Clinton has for decades. ""Cut it"" won out, even though I preferred to wear it longer. My campaign staff insisted I wear stockings even when it was 95 degrees. (I took them off once. Never heard the end of it.) The first feature article on me after I was elected lieutenant governor of Maryland criticized me for not wearing rouge (in reality it was there, just faded); the second one castigated me for wearing flats. From then on I wore heels despite the backache they gave me. A former governor criticized my jewelry: ""Too many bracelets,"" he opined. In another rebuke of my style, a writer called me the ""unglamorous Kennedy,"" clearly pushing substance to the side. Being deemed sexy can be tough on female candidates, too, in ways it isn't for men. Once, before an appearance on Fox News during the 2008 campaign, I heard an animated conversation among the men in the green room about Sarah Palin's positions -- and I don't mean policy. In this respect, she was a breakthrough. Until then, male candidates could be considered sexy, but not women. More recently, when I was in a taxi in Knoxville, Tenn., the driver told me how he dreamed of Mrs. Clinton in the White House because she was ""so hot."" That was different. It's not what she usually gets credit for, but I liked it. These days I'm no longer running for office, but often I'm asked to speak about women who do. I open my talk, ""Women: Taking Power Seriously,"" by having people close their eyes. ""Imagine someone in power,"" I say. Invariably, most say they envision a man despite being at a talk about women. It's not hard to understand why. Sadly, America stands out among nations for its absence of a woman as president. Women have been (or are) presidents or prime ministers in Europe, Latin America, Asia and North America. Why not the United States? For starters, an archetype for a powerful woman doesn't exist in our culture. Without a monarchy, we don't have queens, as Europe does. Our nation was founded on Christian ideals, and we see our God as male. By contrast, India abounds with powerful goddesses. Our holidays that honor leaders are about men -- the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Presidents' Day and the Fourth of July for our founding fathers. Our most prominent national celebration of women is Mother's Day -- hardly a hats-off to women's roles as statesmen. (Consider that last word.) > IN 1776, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband, John, asking him to ""remember the ladies"" as men wrote the laws of our new nation. He laughed at her ""saucy"" letter and responded with words that some people believe still hold true: ""We know better than to repeal our masculine systems."" Western culture itself has deep strands that are misogynistic. We blame Eve for tempting Adam and causing our fall from grace. The third-century theologian Tertullian said women were ""the devil's gateway"" and Thomas Aquinas called them ""misbegotten."" Thousands of women were burned at the stake in Europe, and in our colonial history they were prosecuted for mystical powers at the Salem witch trials. Still, in searching for an American archetype for a female leader, we aren't starting at ground zero. Angela Merkel, while German, shows us what a woman who has earned the respect of her fellow world leaders looks like on a global stage. ""Madam Secretary"" and ""The Good Wife"" portray thoughtful, smart and powerful women on TV. And we can point to an array of women who have influenced our history, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Susan B. Anthony to the four women who have served on the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton carries the burden of all that history and all those stereotypes as the first woman to be nominated by a major party. Often before her experience and qualifications are considered, she is called a witch (or worse) and an enabler for sticking with her husband. In decades in the public spotlight, she has adjusted her style and look, even her name, to adhere to society's evolving perceptions of women as leaders. Now, as she moves center stage in the race for the White House, she will be doing more: shaping a wholly new narrative, and perhaps creating a new archetype. She will be showing young people how a powerful American woman, on the cusp of winning the biggest job in the world, looks and acts.

2318,1021242448.xml,"      MADRID -- Spain plans to release on Thursday two independent reports on the condition of the country's banks, which the government has said it is awaiting to help determine how much of its bailout offer of 100 billion euros it actually needs.   A ballpark figure of about 60 billion euros, or $76 billion, is already widely assumed. And any subsequent, deeper audit of the murky loan portfolios of the most troubled Spanish banks is likely to take time that the Spanish government simply does not have.   Spain is being accused of dithering over the details of the bailout process at a time when the financial markets are eager to know what steps the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy wants to take to fix the underlying problems of its banking system.   ""I don't think Mariano Rajoy's government will be capable of restoring investor confidence because too much has been lost already, and constant standoffs with Angela Merkel over timing and conditions are only making things worse,"" said Edward Hugh, an economist based in Barcelona, referring to the German chancellor. Eventually, he predicted, ""Spain will need a full bailout and very strict conditions and monitoring.""   The latest test of market sentiment will come Thursday, when the Spanish Treasury plans to sell as much as 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in bonds, even as its borrowing costs reach record levels.   However fragile the euro zone looks, European interdependency is one reason Spain's borrowing costs fell some on Wednesday. The decline came amid reports that Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and other European leaders were scrambling to come up with a new and larger financial solution to the European debt crisis before the situation worsened for Italy and other fragile economies.   In such a context, ""a strong statement from the Spanish government detailing how it intends to reform its banks is what is needed now,"" said Tony Anderson, a partner in London at the law firm Pinsent Masons. ""Otherwise we have another leaking bucket to refill and no one able to agree on the size of the bucket or the size of the holes.""   Whatever the findings are Thursday, the Spanish government has insisted that it will not shut crippled institutions. That stance has already prompted a dispute with Joaquin Almunia, Spain's representative in the European Commission, who suggested this month that Spain close at least one of its failed banks.   The stress test results, expected on Thursday, will do little to shed light on how the Spanish government plans to overhaul its most troubled banks, but they are not a pointless exercise, Mr. Hugh said. ""They will give markets a number to work around, and that in itself has a value.""   That 60-billion-euro figure was reflected in a separate analysis published Wednesday by Fitch Ratings, the credit agency. Fitch estimated a capital shortfall for the domestic loan portfolio of Spanish banks of 50 billion to 60 billion euros ($63.5 billion to $76 billion) under a favorable simulation, but that figure could rise to 90 billion to 100 billion euros ($114 billion to $127 billion) under worse conditions -- along the lines, say, of the banking collapse in Ireland.   The reports are being put together by Oliver Wyman and Roland Berger, two consulting firms retained by the Spanish economy ministry in May, giving them just a month to work out how much extra capital the banking sector would need to stay afloat.   They were hired after troubles arose at Bankia, a giant mortgage lender nationalized in early May that is in line to receive 19 billion euros ($24 billion) of the rescue capital offered by Europe. The hiring process was also clouded by a last-minute decision to appoint Roland Berger, a leading German firm but one with little previous experience in Spanish banking, instead of the investment firm BlackRock, because of concern about a possible conflict of interest with BlackRock's fund management activities.   In addition to working under a tight deadline, the two firms have also had to rely on data from the Bank of Spain rather than go through the banking portfolios themselves. The risk such a secondhand approach presents were demonstrated last month by Bankia, when it restated its 2011 accounts. A profit of 309 million euros reported in February suddenly became a loss of 3 billion euros, the largest in Spanish banking history.   The credibility of stress tests has also suffered considerably from flawed efforts to use them earlier in the debt crisis, most notably by the European Banking Authority. The authority gave clean bills of health to Irish and Spanish banks, whose losses subsequently turned out to be significant enough to require bailouts.   ""Unfortunately there is no easy solution -- stress tests have become a key part of the tool kit in dealing with the reshaping of banks,"" said Nils Melngailis, a managing director in London at Alvarez & Marsal, a consulting firm that was involved in assessing Greek and Irish banks. But such stress tests, he added, ""need to be carefully calibrated to be credible.""   The reports issued Thursday are expected to divide Spanish groups into different categories, one of which will indicate institutions that cannot survive without further rescue financing.   Armed with the new estimates of capital requirements, the government is expected to move swiftly to negotiate the final terms of the European rescue package.   Mr. Rajoy has remained defiant as bond investors push up Spain's borrowing costs. ""The fundamentals of the Spanish economy remain well above the risk premium and the debt cost that is being paid at this moment,"" he told reporters at a news conference Wednesday after the conclusion of the meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 in Mexico.   Spanish debt has become even less attractive lately because investors wishing to trade Spanish government bonds through LCH.Clearnet, the largest clearing house in Europe, will have to put up additional money for margin requirements. Investors trading Spanish 10- to 15-year debt, for example, must now put up 14.7 percent of the value of the securities in a margin account, compared with 13.6 percent previously, the clearing house said Tuesday.   Higher margin requirements mean investors must commit more capital to a transaction, reducing their overall funds for investment.   The Spanish government also separately hired four firms to audit the accounts of the 14 largest Spanish banks, encouraging them to actually examine the banks' books to pick up on the kind of auditing failures that surfaced at Bankia. Those audits, though, are not expected to be completed until the end of July.    Credit: RAPHAEL MINDER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

472,926158120.xml,"      SELESTAT, France -- This ancient town in the center of Alsace boasts the extraordinary Humanist Library, dating from the 15th century. But less proudly, Selestat also has an unemployment rate of about 8 percent, much higher than towns just across the border in Germany.    Emmendingen, a German town of 27,000 that is only slightly larger than Selestat and barely 20 miles away, has an unemployment rate of under 3 percent. Among those under 25 years of age, the unemployment rate in Selestat is 23 percent; in Emmendingen, it is 7 percent.   The divergent economic circumstances of these two towns are striking, particularly given the cross-border cultural ties in the region. The reasons for the disparities, much debated, have emerged as a focal point of the French presidential campaign.   Fighting for his re-election, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has said with characteristic bluntness that the French should become more like the Germans. In a recent joint television interview with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, he raised Gallic eyebrows by mentioning the word Germany or German at least 15 times, or about once a minute.   But the issue for Mr. Sarkozy is job creation. Unemployment in France is at a 12-year high and rising. Germany's unemployment rate, at 7.4 percent, is at its lowest point since reunification in 1991.    If re-elected, Mr. Sarkozy proposes a national referendum to approve a more flexible labor market, featuring a German-style apprenticeship. He wants to allow more part-time work, like the Germans, and to subsidize more jobs for youth and raise the value-added tax to reduce the cost of social-welfare charges for employers, as the Germans do, too.    His Socialist opponent, Francois Hollande, rejects most of those ideas, preferring more traditional Socialist responses like more state spending on education and job creation. Many French admire the Germans but do not want to emulate them.   ""We appreciate their rigor and discipline, but that's not all there is in life,"" said Alexandre Boer, 52, who works here in Selestat with young people facing long-term unemployment. ""We're not in 1945 anymore. That was also the German model.""   Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel have had a strained relationship, but it has improved markedly in the pressure cooker of the euro crisis, and Mrs. Merkel once had plans to campaign for him. But she appeared to back off recently when it seemed that her open support might hurt Mr. Sarkozy more than help, by wounding French pride and making him look like a supplicant.   Nevertheless, Mr. Sarkozy is betting that the problems in the French economy, where youth unemployment is 23 percent nationwide and exports are declining, are so profound that voters will overcome their deep-seated reluctance and be more receptive to at least a variation on the German model. But it is not always clear what that would entail, and whether the French would ever stand for it.   One thing is abundantly clear, however. The German economy has powered far ahead of France's, and the gap is widening every year. Germany has maintained its industrial base and competitive edge, both technologically and in terms of cost, while France lacks a large sector of medium-size industrial enterprises and depends much more on services. The French share of global exports has steadily fallen, while the German share has steadily risen.   French salaries have increased in real terms while German salaries have fallen, making French workers more expensive and thus less productive and competitive. French social protections for the unemployed are also much more lavish, especially after the Germans pushed through the so-called Hartz reforms, which largely limited unemployment benefits to 12 months. In France, the duration is 23 months for those under 50 and three years for those over 50, many of whom never work again.   In part to pay for those benefits, the cost to business of an hour's labor is 11 percent higher in France. But there is less job security in Germany, and more Germans do part-time work. The Germans do not have a centrally fixed minimum wage, as the French do.    The practical results of these trends are visible in these border towns, where the shape of industry -- largely small- to medium-size metal-working companies or factories -- is similar. For example, there are 10 times as many job offers a month on the German side as on the French one, said Norbert Mattusch, who works on cross-border cooperation for the German Federal Employment Agency in Freiburg.    While some Germans cross the border to work in France, few French do the same, except for seasonal labor at the large amusement park nearby, Europa-Park, the largest in Germany and the third-largest in Europe, which draws many French-speaking customers.    ""We have job openings right now for 70 drivers of heavy trucks,"" Mr. Mattusch said. ""But the big problem is that the French don't speak German,"" so they cannot qualify for the jobs, and young people here no longer speak the Alsatian dialect, once used on both sides of the border. The mayor of Emmendingen, Stefan Schlatterer, says that ""there is a job here for anyone who can count to ten,"" but one needs to count in German.   Salaries on the German side are higher for similar work, goods are cheaper, the cost of hiring a full-time employee is lower and the relationship between German workers and their bosses is more supple and flexible, freer of the centralized regulations, ministries and unions characteristic of France.   But while the French may admire German rigor, they are reluctant to make some of the same sacrifices, including longer hours and less job security.    Boris Gourdial, director of the Freiburg branch of the German Federal Employment Agency, said that mentalities were different, despite shared history and proximity. ""The French work to live and the Germans live to work,"" he said, a cliche that still resonates.    His French colleague, Roxane Pierrel, who runs the employment office in Selestat, smiles politely. She points out that the French have more children than the Germans and more women are in the work force, which swells the numbers looking for work. But she acknowledges that the Germans are doing better at job training for young people, especially with a nationwide apprenticeship system that Mr. Sarkozy wants to introduce more widely in France. ""The systems may be different,"" she said. ""But all the enterprises on both sides of the border are looking for competence.""   Many labor experts single out the German apprenticeship system as a major competitive advantage. It takes young people out of the university track at 16 and trains them in industrial skills, as they simultaneously study for a technical degree and work for a salary. They often get full-time jobs with companies that have invested in training.   Unlike in the rest of France, there is a vestigial apprenticeship system in Alsace, which was at different times a part of Germany. But it is closer to a French ""alternance"" model of vocational training, which also combines education and work, but is less widespread among companies and less popular.   Many French parents and their children still regard a vocational degree or apprenticeship -- instead of a university degree -- as a sign of stupidity or failure, Ms. Pierrel said. ""We have to convince young people, since it's not well accepted in the family,"" she said. In France, ""it means being a bad student. In Germany, it doesn't devalue someone.""   But she is beginning to see a change, she said. ""Companies here are working with schools to promote apprenticeships,"" and more young people see the advantage of a salary at a decent job as preferable to unemployment.   Marcel Bauer, the mayor of Selestat and its 21,000 people, also sees a change. He says he is proud of the local apprenticeship system, which he thinks should be developed in the rest of France. But unlike in Germany, where the states and localities can set many of their own rules, in France, he said, ""the national Education Ministry wants to keep all control.""    Mr. Bauer also bemoans the constant labor warfare in France. ""German workers accept that they must make efforts in a crisis, and work less and earn less to keep their jobs."" But ""with us,"" he said, ""it's an immediate battle and a strike and people in the streets.""    Mr. Bauer, mayor since 2001, has also been promoting more bilingual classes, so local students will learn some German. He has been trying to promote more regional partnership with the Germans, including with Emmendingen's mayor, Mr. Schlatterer.    Both mayors speak emotionally of the importance of French-German cooperation. ""I feel the center of the European idea is the really close partnership between France and Germany,"" Mr. Schlatterer said. ""When France and Germany are close to one another, Europe works.""

2643,433300983.xml,"      Call her the emerging star of European politics, but also ask: Will Germany let it last? With personal approval ratings of about 75 percent at home and expressions of admiration from places as far apart as Washington and Moscow, Chancellor Angela Merkel has clearly made an extremely good impression in the four months since she took office.  Her ratings are especially impressive given that she ran such a lackluster campaign last year that she almost lost a national election she had been expected to win by a large margin. This inauspicious beginning forced her into a coalition with the Social Democrats, the main left-of-center rival of her Christian Democrats. But Mrs. Merkel, the first woman to serve as chancellor, has used her first months to project an image of good sense and quiet competence, and the mood in Germany is probably better than it has been in several years. Consumer confidence is up, and the conspicuous gloom that afflicted the last months of Ms. Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, has been lifting. Yet there is a strong feeling that Mrs. Merkel's popularity is not so much because she is showing strength and determination as Germany's leader, but rather because of her decision to advance very little in the way of a bold domestic agenda. That may be about to change. Three German states have elections on Sunday, after which Mrs. Merkel is expected to start her campaign to win major changes, tackling such chronic problems as high unemployment, economic stagnation and government deficits that exceed norms set for Germany's membership in the European Currency Union. That is when the political storm will stir. ''She has done a good job insofar as she hasn't made any mistakes,'' said Uwe Andersen, a political science professor at Ruhr University in Bochum. ''But we'll have to see how she does on the really big reforms after the state elections before we can judge if she is doing well in a positive sense, rather than just not making mistakes.'' So far Mrs. Merkel seems to have chosen to make her mark as a sort of super foreign minister, not as a domestic policy chieftain -- and in Germany, the foreign minister has always been popular. ''Merkel still acts as if other people are responsible for the country's problems,'' the weekly magazine Der Spiegel wrote a few days ago. ''She still hasn't started to govern,'' the magazine continued, echoing an opinion widely voiced here. Reinhard Schlinkert, the chairman of the Institute for Market and Policy Research, citing poll numbers from late February, said, ''About two-thirds of Germans say she won't be able to manage unemployment, and two-thirds say she won't manage the country's financial problems. It's a very insecure situation. ''Everybody hopes that the new coalition will do better for Germany, but the people have heard so many times that things will change that now they're sitting back and waiting for results.'' Governing in a coalition with her formal rivals, the Social Democrats, is far from what Mrs. Merkel wanted when she campaigned for office last year. But the existence of the coalition and the paramount goal of keeping it strong and stable has protected her, at least in these early stages, from Germany's normal political squabbling. For one thing, Mrs. Merkel herself, bound by the compromise formulas of her coalition, could not have pressed a maximalist program for change even if she had wanted to. At the same time the Social Democrats, who would lose major parts of their labor union constituency if they supported maximalist changes, have been reluctant to criticize her, lest political infighting weaken the coalition. All that has given Mrs. Merkel a strong start, one that contrasts with the weakness of her counterparts in other European capitals. The French are in an uproar, and President Jacques Chirac, in office for 11 years, is seen as a lame duck. The Italians' buccaneering prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, after five stormy years, is behind in the polls two and a half weeks before national elections. In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair has been beset by a long series of political battles and demands for him to cede his office to his colleague and rival in the Labor Party, Gordon Brown. Ahead of the state elections on Sunday, polls indicate that Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats will win two of them. In the third state, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mrs. Merkel is probably hoping to lose to Social Democrats, so they will not be tempted to rebel against their role in the national coalition. To start addressing perennial German economic problems, Mrs. Merkel will have to turn away from her concentration on foreign policy. In her first months in office, she spent a lot of time announcing herself to foreign partners, visiting Warsaw, Washington, Paris, London, Jerusalem and Moscow. In addition, only a few weeks after she took office, she played a central role in breaking an acrimonious stalemate over the budget of the European Union, which enhanced her standing at home as a figure to be contended with on the European scene. As the former Social Democratic Defense Minister Peter Struck said, referring to Mrs. Merkel's return from diplomatic triumph to face domestic reality, ''The red carpet time for Mrs. Merkel is over.''

1599,2269289630.xml,"WASHINGTON -- As President Trump doubles down on a re-election approach of stoking fear of immigrants, he is once again elevating a voice of validation -- and many say racism -- that he discovered during his last presidential campaign.That voice is Katie Hopkins, a far-right British commentator who has made denunciations of migrants and Muslims -- and defenses of Mr. Trump -- a staple of her public discourse. British headlines have routinely labeled Ms. Hopkins a ""racist"" and a ""bigot"" for her views about immigrants.On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump invoked Ms. Hopkins shortly before a mass shooting that killed 22 in El Paso, where the suspect wrote an anti-immigrant manifesto that echoed Mr. Trump's inflammatory language about migrants.The president, at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., shared a tweet from Ms. Hopkins condemning London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, over the city's crime rate. Mr. Trump has feuded with Mr. Khan since 2016, when Mr. Khan criticized his remarks about Islam.""The nipple-height Mayor of Londonistan has NEVER been so unpopular,"" Ms. Hopkins tweeted. ""He has MINUS approval ratings because we are stab-city. London deserves better. Get Khan Out.""The president also retweeted a post by Ms. Hopkins that blamed the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for crimes committed by immigrants.On Monday, facing public pressure to address the racism behind the El Paso shooting, Mr. Trump spoke critically of white supremacism, in remarks drafted primarily by an adviser, Stephen Miller. But it is often Mr. Trump's Twitter feed that carries his authentic voice.Mr. Trump has a history of promoting inflammatory far-right opinions, including those of white nationalists, conspiracy theorists and critics of Islam. Still, the president's embrace of Ms. Hopkins, amid a flurry of other news stories, has received little attention, something that has concerned some advocates of immigration reform.""There is no debate on what sort of person Katie Hopkins is,"" said Todd Schulte, the president of the group FWD.us. ""The president should have stopped using his platform to spread her ideology long ago. He has not; that tells people all they need to know.""Ms. Hopkins, a former Sun and Daily Mail columnist who appeared on the British version of ""The Apprentice,"" has become well known in Britain for her provocative views.In a 2015 column, she compared migrants to cockroaches. And after a suicide bombing killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in 2017, Ms. Hopkins tweeted that ""we need a final solution"" to the terrorism problem. She later deleted the post.Sowing fear of Muslims -- and calling out other politicians for not using the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" -- was a bedrock of Mr. Trump's run to the presidency in 2016. In an interview that March, he told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that ""Islam hates us."" The previous year, he would not rule out a mandatory registry of Muslims in the United States in an interview with Yahoo News and, after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., called for a ban on Muslims entering the country.Ms. Hopkins's tweets and commentary were first a source of affirmation for Mr. Trump in his campaign.""Thank you to respected columnist Katie Hopkins,"" Mr. Trump tweeted in 2015, ""for her powerful writing on the U.K.'s Muslim problems."" In another tweet, he said, ""The politicians of the U.K. should watch Katie Hopkins,"" adding, ""Many people in the U.K. agree with me!""Mr. Trump has praised Twitter as a way to speak directly with his supporters, and in turn the platform has become a way for some of his most controversial supporters to reach him directly.But Mr. Trump had stayed away from Ms. Hopkins's Twitter feed since he became president. This summer, though, she caught Mr. Trump's eye again as he attacked Mr. Khan during his state visit to Britain.And last month, Mr. Trump retweeted Ms. Hopkins's post suggesting that ""send her back"" -- a chant by Trump supporters directed at one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress -- could be a new campaign slogan. ""Send her back is the new lock her up,"" she wrote.Managing Mr. Trump's Twitter habits is sometimes a group effort, done in conjunction with his longtime adviser, Dan Scavino. But on weekends, while alone, Mr. Trump tends to scroll through the replies to his tweets, and will often pick up what he has seen there, a former administration official said.He is particularly receptive to tweets that reinforce his own views, the official said, as well as posts by people who have blue checks next to their names, designating them as verified by Twitter.A White House spokesman did not answer a question about how Mr. Trump had found Ms. Hopkins's tweets.In an interview, Ms. Hopkins said she had never spoken with Mr. Trump, but she declined to answer whether any of his advisers had ever reached out to her. Still, she described Mr. Trump as a kindred spirit who was being treated unfairly for speaking out about immigration.""I think it's not a surprise that Trump would retweet my tweets,"" Ms. Hopkins said, adding that she saw Britain and the United States as similar in terms of urban elites speaking with louder voices than others.""I guess that's why President Trump and I have ended up with a similar message,"" she said. She praised Mr. Trump's efforts to impose a travel ban on a half-dozen mostly Muslim countries early in his term.""I think the travel ban was at least a way of saying we need to take back control,"" she said.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.Katie Hopkins",2019-08-08
297,1115333999.xml,"       MADRID -- Though hardly a surprise, Friday's report that Spain's unemployment rate had surpassed 25 percent was bad news for a government that recently trumpeted a streamlining of its labor market rules.  The ranks of the unemployed swelled to 5.78 million people at the end of the third quarter, compared with 5.69 million a quarter earlier and 2.6 million four years ago, when Spain's property bubble burst, the report said.  The jobs data signaled a deepening recession and raised the likelihood that Spain would again miss budget targets agreed to with other euro zone countries.  There was, however, one perversely positive element to the report: the labor picture is so bleak that it could help Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy make the case that Germany and other lenders cannot risk imposing further austerity measures on Spain's economy in return for providing more European rescue funding.  The dire jobs report ""gives Rajoy more leverage in his European negotiations and is good ammunition to ask for more time to adapt,"" said Federico Steinberg, an economist at the Elcano Royal Institute, a research organization in Madrid.  Mr. Rajoy, however, is also fighting the crisis at home. Unions have called a general strike for Nov. 14, and elections in Catalonia on Nov. 25 could accelerate that region's drive toward independence.  Luis Garicano, a professor at the London School of Economics, said the government's cost of paying unemployment benefits, now almost 4 percent of gross domestic product, was unsustainable. After 20 consecutive quarters of job destruction, he said, ""people see very little light at the end of the tunnel, and Spaniards are losing hope.""  The separatist push in Catalonia ""is partly a reaction to this lack of hope,"" Dr. Garicano said. ""It worries me for what it says about what can happen in the next two years, in which we will have a sharp fiscal contraction, low external demand, continuing deleveraging by households and restricted credit to companies.""  On Friday, the International Monetary Fund and a team of European officials wrapped up a visit to Spain to assess its efforts to shore up its banking sector. The so-called troika of the I.M.F., the European Commission and the European Central Bank issued positive statements but urged Mr. Rajoy's government to maintain momentum on reform.  The assessment is part of the process that would enable Spain to receive up to 100 billion euros, or $130 billion, of banking aid that euro zone finance ministers pledged in June to provide. Lengthy wrangling over how to disburse the money underscores the extent to which Spain is losing the sovereignty argument Mr. Rajoy has long employed.  Instead, Mr. Rajoy was forced at a recent summit meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to accept that conditions for Spain to receive European funding essentially need the approval of Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is increasingly wary of supporting any additional euro zone bailout program ahead of next year's elections.  Spain's banking crisis came to the fore in early May, when Madrid nationalized one of the country's largest lenders, Bankia, and then requested the banking bailout a month later. On Friday, Bankia reported a loss of 2.6 billion euros for the third quarter.  One of the immediate challenges for Madrid is how to value assets that Bankia and other troubled banks are set to transfer to a so-called bad bank, which is meant to sequester tens of billions of euros of property loans and repossessed assets that carry the risk of never being repaid or sold.  In setting up the bad bank, Madrid must perform a balancing act, one that proved Ireland's undoing earlier in the European debt crisis. The challenge is to make such assets cheap enough to attract private investors without forcing the entire banking sector to make steep and immediate reductions in the value of their whole property portfolios.  One possible investor in the bad bank is the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is also in talks to invest in the Spanish hotel chain NH Hoteles, the lodging company said Friday.  In Spain, ""we are starting to see some positive indicators,"" said Alexandre Perez Casares, a private equity associate at K.K.R.'s London office. ""Of course, the key requirement is to make private investors feel confident to commit long-term capital to Spain and to finalize the stabilization of the financial sector, for which a successful implementation of the bad bank is critical.""  While the latest jobs report makes for grim reading, Spain is showing resilience in some crucial sectors of its economy. Exports have risen, as they did in neighboring Portugal, which has swung to a trade surplus.  Tourism, which accounts for one-tenth of Spain's economy, has also remained relatively buoyant, with Spain welcoming a record number of foreign visitors this summer -- 7.7 million in July alone.  An announcement this week by Ford that it would shut three factories elsewhere in Europe, eliminating 5,700 jobs, elicited a sigh of relief in Spain. The decision essentially protects Ford's factory in Valencia, which will take over production from Genk, the Belgian factory Ford plans to close.  Javier Díaz-Giménez, an economics professor at IESE Business School, said he had ""a change of mind"" around July about whether Spain's adjustment efforts were working. ""I believe Spain is coming out of recession, but very slowly,"" he said.  Solving the costly unemployment problem, however, is a real challenge. Drastic measures like lowering the minimum wage or cutting unemployment benefits, Mr. Díaz-Giménez warned, would probably mean ""fire on the streets.""

2044,869393537.xml,"      LONDON -- A new rescue package for Greece is taking shape, one that would offer billions of euros in new loans in return for accelerated privatization and tougher tax collection measures on the part of the beleaguered Greek government, European officials said on Tuesday.    While the agreement for as much as 60 billion euros ($86 billion), would in theory address Greece's need for cash this year and next, it puts off for the time being a restructuring, hard or soft, of Greece's huge debt burden.    At the deal's heart would be an informal understanding that the private sector holders of Greek government bonds might be persuaded to roll over their debts, or extend new loans when their older obligations come due.    By taking on more dubious Greek risk -- backed by new money from Europe and the International Monetary Fund -- exposed banks would not just step back from the precipice of a ""haircut,"" or a forced loss on their bonds, they might also hope that in another two years Greece will be in a better position to repay its debts in full.    The expectation that Europe will again come to Greece's rescue bolstered both the euro and stocks on Tuesday. Yields on Greek 10-year bonds have dropped sharply, to 15.7 percent on Tuesday from a high of 16.8 percent last week. European stocks rose nearly 2 percent, and the United States market was up about 1 percent.   ""Restructuring is off the table,"" a senior official in the Greek Finance Ministry said. ""For now it is all about growth, growth, growth."" This person, who spoke on condition of anonymity while the talks continued, said an announcement from the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank could come as soon as Friday or early next week.    Later in June, the European Union first and then the I.M.F. would approve the additional financing, thus clearing the way for 12.5 billion euros to be disbursed to Athens at the end of the month.    The new loans, however, will be forthcoming only if more austerity measures are introduced.    Along with faster progress on privatization, Europe and the fund have been demanding that Greece finally begin cutting public sector jobs and closing down unprofitable entities.    They also have been pressing Greek politicians to unite behind the new austerity package to help ensure it sticks, and are discussing a decrease in the value-added tax as a concession to win support from the right-of-center opposition, which wants more tax relief to help the moribund economy.    A team of bankers and technical experts from the international institutions have been in Athens for close to a month, trying to find a solution to Greece's financial condition.    Harsh austerity measures have taken a severe toll on the economy, resulting in missed financial targets and the need for more public money.    Adding to the urgency has been the persistent flow of deposits out of the banking sector. Since the crisis began, 60 billion euros in deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks, about a quarter of the country's output. Bankers in Athens said that outflows were particularly severe last Thursday and Friday after comments -- later described as rhetorical -- by a Greek politician about the possibility that Greece could stop using the euro.    With great reluctance, European governments have come to the conclusion that an additional 60 billion euros now, while politically unappealing, would be less costly than the unquantifiable public money that would be needed if a restructuring of Greece's debt produced a contagion that spread not just to Portugal and Ireland but possibly Spain and the financial system as a whole.    But how an economy already in free fall will generate the growth to produce the needed budgetary surplus to start paying down its debt remains unanswered.    ""Greece's G.D.P. is already declining, and now the government will need to cut another 7 billion euros in spending,"" said Jason Manolopoulos, who manages a hedge fund based in Athens and Geneva and is the author of ""Greece's 'Odious' Debt: The Looting of the Hellenic Republic by the Euro, the Political Elite and the Investment Community.""    ""That is only going to make the debt to G.D.P. figures worse,"" he said. ""There is no getting around it: Greece is insolvent.""    With a debt of 150 percent of G.D.P., that may well be so. But while skeptics like Mr. Manolopoulos are keeping the cash levels in their funds high, convinced that Greece will be required to default sooner rather than later, such a sense of pressing gloom has not yet become contagious.    The big bet for Europe and the I.M.F. is whether private-sector banks can be persuaded to keep their Greek exposure. This new approach is patterned on a 2008 pact called the Vienna Initiative, in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the I.M.F. persuaded banks with exposure in Hungary, Romania and other East European countries to keep their credit lines fresh while new public sector loans were provided to these countries.    There is, however, a big difference between jawboning a regional public institution to lend more to a country in which it already has operations than persuading a risk-averse commercial bank in France, Germany or Italy to lend more to a country that it wants to permanently cut ties to.    What is more, there is a significant difference in the sums involved. A report Tuesday by the credit ratings agency Fitch suggested that the 50 billion to 60 billion euros being discussed might not be enough, and that as much as 100 billion euros in extra financing would be needed to give Greece the time and space to return to solvency.    Another crucial point is the extent to which ""reform fatigue"" in Greece might prevent the ambitious deficit-cutting targets from being reached. A recent survey by Kapa Research found strong support for privatization, but two other polls found support for the governing Socialists at the lowest level since 2009 elections.    Prime Minister George A. Papandreou still has a comfortable majority in Parliament, but his credibility has been damaged as the economic growth stagnates and unemployment rises.    In fact, the dynamic of protesters has changed drastically over the last several weeks. No longer is it just union leaders condemning the government's policies, but a broader collection of people, mostly young, who have been inspired by a protest movement in Spain.    Their numbers so far have not been large, but they have been consistent -- filling up the main Syntagma Square in Athens for seven days running.    ""People here have lost 30 percent of their income,"" said Theodore Pelagidis, an economist based in Athens and author of a recent book on the collapse of the Greek economy.    ""It is nice that we are getting a loan from Angela Merkel,"" Mr. Pelagidis added, referring to the German chancellor, ""but I am not sure this will be enough given the depth of the recession. We are just kicking the can further down the road until the time finally comes to restructure the debt.""    Protesters Gathered in Front of the Greek Parliament On Tuesday.

3804,1647999266.xml,"       DAVOS, Switzerland --  On opening night at the annual gathering of the moneyed here, Russia's state-owned bank VTB put on a lavish party, with dancers in gorgeous versions of Russian traditional dress, Russian-style nouvelle cuisine and raucous music by, among others, the Balkan film director Emir Kusturica. Poorly attended, it nevertheless had a purpose: to underline that, despite war in Ukraine, Western sanctions, tumbling oil prices and the weak ruble, business in and with Russia should carry on. VTB's president, Andrei L. Kostin, trying for a sunny note, said in his welcome, ""No rain, no rainbow."" Even so, more storm clouds loom for the Kremlin. For Russia, the event at Davos, a gathering of thousands of business figures, politicians, academics and other influential people that ended Saturday, made clear how much the sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine have damaged Moscow's ties with Europe and the United States. Also evident was its pursuit of Asia as a key alternative. Russian businessmen said privately that their meetings this year in Davos were almost exclusively with Chinese, Indian and Middle East partners or potential investors. The Europeans and Americans so strikingly absent from Mr. Kostin's opening-night party were barely on the agenda. One of Russia's richest men, Oleg V. Deripaska, painted a grim picture. Appearing on a government television channel, Russia 24, from Davos on Thursday, Mr. Deripaska said Russia was ""somewhere between 1993 and 1995"" in terms of complex, acute economic problems. With irony, he added, ""There is only one positive point: It is clear that it will be bad,"" and that rosy forecasts had been completely overtaken. Asked if he had told Russia's leaders that, he said he was too busy working. But he added, ""The worst is yet to come."" Russia entered Davos defiant. Arkady Dvorkovich, a deputy prime minister, identified Europe and the United States, not lower oil prices, as Russia's biggest problem. ""Right now, there is major volatility, but it's not going to last for long,"" Mr. Dvorkovich said. He added that Russia would use its reserves to stabilize its banking system and make up for lost revenue. ""The economy will slide, but it's not going to last forever, even with sanctions,"" he said. ""We will find a way to grow."" By Friday, Russians admitted their pain. ""We are not benefiting from sanctions; we are losing,"" Mr. Kostin said at a Russia session. Aleksei L. Kudrin, the former finance minister, who still maintains good ties to the Kremlin, went further. ""The most important problem for the government is trust,"" he said. ""Without structural reforms, we won't have trust, and won't be able to get out of this mess."" Nonetheless, the most senior Russian official present, Igor I. Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister, insisted that President Vladimir V. Putin ""enjoys massive support."" Invoking history going back to Catherine the Great, he suggested that while he and the other Russians in Davos might welcome democracy, Russia is simply not ready for it. And, he stressed, Russians always rally to a leader perceived to be under outside pressure. Gradually, the session descended into a classic Russian argument about history among those on the podium, and then with a well-known critical journalist, Yevgenia M. Albats. The Russian Internet exploded in scorn after Mr. Shuvalov acknowledged earning handsomely from Russia's shift from communism to capitalism, which he admitted had brought millions of his compatriots to ruin. Attendees from China, which Mr. Putin has pursued as an alternative to the now damaged ties with the West, looked on in astonishment. ""I was rather surprised that the Russians differed with each other so strongly,"" said Wu Xinbo, dean of international studies at Fudan University, who was on the podium. He echoed the Russians in saying China's business community is flocking to Russia. Trade is expected to increase to $100 billion this year from $90 billion in 2014, he said. But Li Daokui of Tsinghua University in Beijing, sharing a podium with Kirill A. Dmitriev, who heads Russia's direct investment fund, suggested that Russia was less than a coveted partner. ""The Russian economy is not doing well,"" he said, noting projections of a 5 percent contraction this year on top of existing damage. Russia may be speeding up talks with China, he added, but ""Russia should have done projects with Europe, with Eastern Europe, with other parts of the world."" At a party hosted by another Russian bank, Sberbank, a few veterans of European-Russian business appeared. German Gref, the bank's head, explicitly thanked friends for their support. But the dearth of new business was plain. While big German firms have not shut down operations in Russia, they are not making new investments. That trend holds across Western Europe, said Michael Rake, head of the Confederation of British Industry. John Smith of Bain & Company, one of the few Westerners at the VTB opening party, recalled the heady days of helping to design Russia's rough and ready plunge into capitalism. One prime goal then, he said, was to make the shift irreversible. But the conflict in Ukraine has already undone much, despite the distaste of Western business and bankers for sanctions. ""Business hopes that common sense will prevail,"" Mr. Rake said, expressing a common sentiment. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has said Mr. Putin is testing the West over Ukraine, reiterated that sanctions would remain as long as Russia and its friends fought on. Over the past two decades, Russians and Ukrainians joined other emerged powers as fixtures at Davos, paying the high fees of the World Economic Forum, 250,000 euros and upward, or about $280,000, and adopting the perks of being global players. Last week, the partying could not mask the depth of their enmity and the high stakes in the conflict at Europe's eastern borders. President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine dramatized his country's state by holding up high what he said was a piece of shell-pocked metal from a bus where 13 civilians died when artillery struck on Jan. 10. The International Monetary Fund pledged undetermined additional funds for bankrupt Ukraine. Its new young ministers assured Western supporters that they really would root out corruption after 25 years of weak post-Soviet governance. Russian businessmen complained privately that the West was encouraging Ukraine to go after Russia and Kremlin-backed rebels in Ukraine's east. Western backers of Ukraine cast the conflict in epochal terms. It pits Mr. Putin's 19th-century vision against the modern world, they said. ""The future of Russia will be decided by the success or failure of Ukraine,"" said Carl Bildt, the former Swedish foreign minister and prime minister. ""History will judge the West in 2015 as much, or more, by what it does for Ukraine as by what it does to Russia,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, the former United States Treasury secretary, now at Harvard University. Credit: ALISON SMALE; Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

1497,815308782.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED DUBLIN -- Ireland has finally taken its medicine, accepting the financial rescue package European officials have been pushing for several weeks.   But even as Europe moved to avert this latest debt crisis, economists and policy experts are increasingly debating whether it would be better, and fairer, for the Continent's weakest economies to default on payments to lenders.   Many experts now say that bailouts only delay the inevitable. Instead of further wounding their economies with drastic budget-slashing, the specialists assert,  governments should immediately start talks with bondholders and force them to accept a loss on their investments.   The risk, of course, is an investor panic that would seize financial markets at a time when the global economy remains on tenterhooks.   But an organized restructuring of debt that would reduce the amount of money troubled countries owed, especially in conjunction with a financial aid package, might provide a quicker path to recovery and avoid the trauma of a forced default down the road, some economists argue.   To be sure, it is easier to propound solutions from the comfort of a policy research institution as opposed to actually making a decision when more than one country's financial future is at stake -- the broader euro zone could be affected as well.   ""Policy makers face the same dilemma as in any crisis with respect to haircutting bonds, and the real-life decisions are always extremely difficult,"" said Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who faced just such a quandary in 1994, when he  helped arrange a $47 billion rescue package for the Mexican government as it teetered on the verge of default.   ""Holding bondholders harmless contributes to moral hazard and increases risks elsewhere,""  Mr. Rubin added. ""But imposing bond haircuts can make future market access expensive or impossible for an extended time and can create serious contagion effects elsewhere.""   The term ""haircuts"" refers to the loss an investor takes when a borrower fails to pay back its loans.   One signal that the policy pendulum may be swinging away from bondholders came  this month when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, supported by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, tried to convince other European leaders that bondholders needed to accept some of the risk in future bailouts.   The move spurred a bond market rout, and Ms. Merkel had to retreat. But her argument has taken hold in the debate over how best to handle debt crises as Europe turns its attention from Ireland  --  which will receive $109 billion to $123 billion in loan as part of the rescue package  --  to the shaky economies of Portugal and Spain.   Proponents of a default say that Argentina and Russia, in 2002 and 1998, found life after a debt restructuring. Both reneged on their foreign loans and, after devaluing their currencies, were able to recover.   Even so, any talk of default  --  or a debt restructuring, the term that bankers and technocrats prefer  --  remains anathema in capitals like Athens and Dublin. Their leaders fear that they would be put in a financial penalty box and denied fresh access to funds.   Complicating matters is that, unlike Argentina and Russia, Ireland and other troubled European countries that use the euro as a common currency cannot devalue their currencies; thus, they lack this tool to help nurse their economies back to good health by improving their competitive position and increasing exports.   In Ireland, which has an external debt 10 times the size of the economy and bank losses that jeopardized the country's solvency, there is little sympathy for those who lent to the country's faltering banks.   ""The people who provided the funds to these banks should take the consequences,"" said Peter Mathews, a banking consultant in Dublin. Mr. Mathews estimates that making senior bondholders take an appropriate loss on their bank holdings of 18 billion euros would save the country about 15 billion euros.   Those who favor restructuring say it is only fair that lenders absorb losses and share the pain. A loss of this amount for lenders would be roughly the same as the government is planning to extract from its citizens over the next four years in the form of spending cuts and tax increases so as to bring its deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product,  from 32 percent.   ""There is just no escaping debt restructuring for Greece and Ireland,"" said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and expert on sovereign debt crises.   But if it is inevitable  --  as many financial analysts and mainstream economists like Mr. Rogoff and Nouriel Roubini are now saying  --  why not do it now?   That is not easily done, says Mr. Rogoff, who was a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund when Argentina defaulted. He points to the fact that the I.M.F. executive board, which has authority to approve  all aid disbursements, is controlled by the main creditor banking nations like the United States, Britain,  Germany and France, whose investors stand to lose the most in a default.   ""The I.M.F. never comes in and says, 'We will give you money but you have to restructure,' "" he continued.  ""Restructuring only happens at the end of a failed program.""   This year, the monetary fund made clear its position on default when it issued a staff paper defiantly titled: ""Default in Today's Advanced Economies: Unnecessary, Undesirable and Unlikely.""   Authors of the report say the views are their own and not the fund's. Yet, in arguing that indebted economies like Greece and Ireland will not follow in the path of Argentina, they echo a view that the monetary fund has long embraced.   Unlike Argentina before it went belly up, Greece and Ireland have large primary deficits, which means that even without paying interest on their debt they still spend more than they  collect in taxes. The deficit is about 10 percent of G.D.P. in each case.   So abandoning their debt obligations would not eliminate the need for cash, which would become all the more acute because their default would deny them access to international debt markets.   The authors also take on what they call the  ""soak-the-rich argument."" In the case of Argentina and Russia, for example, the creditors were largely  banks in the United States.   In the euro zone, more than  2 trillion euros in sovereign debt belonging to Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal is held largely by German, French, British banks and, in the case of Greece, local banks and pension funds.   So the investor pain would be felt throughout Europe, and could well ignite a systemic panic as banks across the Continent suddenly found themselves with big losses.   Here in Ireland,  people are doubtful that default is the answer. ""Ireland is in the business of paying back its debts,"" the Prime Minister Brian Cowen said as he campaigned on tiny Arranmore Island off Ireland's north coast  over the weekend.   By Monday, Mr. Cowen had become the first political casualty of the sovereign debt crisis, agreeing to step down once a series of fiscal packages and budgets were in place next month.   Still his view that Ireland pays its debts was echoed by many of the recession-weary Irish citizens.   ""I think we are past the stage of forcing a haircut on the bondholders,"" said John Joe Duffy, the island's parish priest. ""We don't want to create more panic --  we just want confidence to return.""

1192,433957610.xml,"      The global financial crisis has tested more than lending institutions, stock markets and the nerves of investors everywhere. It has put the bold notion of European unity under the microscope again, where critics say it once more has been found wanting.   Half a century ago, the European Union was born on the ideal of close cooperation between countries torn by war. Since the formal adoption of a common currency, the euro, European leaders have pledged tight coordination of financial policies and promoted new steps toward political integration as well.   Speaking on Saturday of how to manage the financial storm, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, declared, ""What is of the essence is that Europe should exist and respond with one voice.""   But over the past week as the crisis has radiated around the globe, some of the 27 nations that make up the European Union have broken ranks, opting in ugly disarray for self-interested policies to protect their own citizens and banks first.    At a time when the scale of events would seem to call for concerted action, critics say, the stock and credit market upheavals have elicited raw emotions and reflexive, unilateral actions. After a week of squabbling and rushed meetings, finance ministers agreed Tuesday to take a few modest steps to shore up markets. But they did little to dispel growing doubts that the European Union could grapple collectively with a common crisis.   ""This is unprecedented,"" said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London. ""It has exposed the limits of European integration and coordination when presented with a crisis of this magnitude.""    Defenders of the European Union were quick to point out that its system, which lacks a central finance ministry comparable to the Treasury Department in the United States, was not designed for this kind of crisis.   And quietly, they point out that the Treasury Department did not prevent the United States from creating the mortgage mess; nor did Congress, speaking a single language on behalf of a single nation, have such an easy time finding consensus on a response.   ""Political will is always in short supply when there's no risk,"" said Jan Techau, director of the Europe program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, who said he was often skeptical of the European Union, but understanding of its present struggles. ""You can either say, see how long it took them, look at how impotent they are, or you can say, when push comes to shove, they can really act. You can look at it positively or negatively.""   The meeting of member countries' finance ministers on Tuesday illustrated the virtues and the flaws of the union. The ministers managed to more than double the minimum level of guarantees for bank deposits in member countries, to around $67,500, but that was less than half what some member states had asked for.    ""They haven't drawn the line in the sand yet,"" said Irwin Collier, professor of economics at the Free University in Berlin. He added: ""They established a minimum, and you can hear the sound of one hand clapping for that measure. It's very modest.""   The disarray has raised painful memories of Ireland's single-handed rejection of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty in June, dealing a serious blow to the bloc's efforts to streamline decision making and increase its political clout. It also comes five years after the start of the United States-led war in Iraq in 2003, which exposed deep fissures among European countries. Two months ago, Russia's invasion of Georgia showed that many of those same differences, particularly between countries like Germany and the more recent member states of Eastern Europe, still remained.    European countries struggled to agree to a joint response to the Georgia crisis, although agree they ultimately did. ""The E.U. was utterly divided over Russia,"" said Mark Leonard, executive director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and author of ""Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century."" ""But given that, it did better than anyone expected.""   Beating low expectations is not the same as living up to its  purpose. ""The divisions mean that the E.U. is definitely punching below its weight,"" Mr. Leonard said, pointing to its much larger population, higher combined military spending and an economy that dwarfs Russia's.   In the caldron of the global financial crisis, Ireland was the first to break ranks, acting unilaterally on Sept. 30 to guarantee the deposits and debts of its six largest financial institutions, a go-it-alone approach that was denounced by its neighbors and regulators in Brussels. They feared that savers across the Continent might flee their domestic banks in a destabilizing rush for the government-backed safety of Irish banks.    Even before a weekend emergency meeting in Paris of the union's four biggest economies -- Germany, France, Italy and Britain -- German officials had rejected a proposal floated by the French for a common European bailout fund along the lines of the United States plan devised by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.   In Berlin, where the financial crisis has emboldened criticism of the no-holds-barred, Anglo-Saxon capitalist model, officials argued that Germany, traditionally the European Union's largest financial contributor, should not pay for a problem that began elsewhere.    Then on Sunday, Germany unilaterally promised to guarantee all retail deposits in its own banking system  to calm the country's skittish savers. ""Trust, the most important currency for financial markets, has been lost,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said  Tuesday.    In Brussels, the atmosphere is fraught over the national disarray on the financial crisis, but also with a sense that the criticism is unfair. Without a unionwide banking regulatory system or fiscal policy, any reaction to the crisis was inevitably going to be national in character.    And that, proponents say, only  underlines the need for greater integration and regulation and the creation of some kind of pan-European fiscal architecture.    ""I believe events have shown that no country is immune from this crisis,"" said Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, on Tuesday. ""I hope that persuades the most skeptical people of the benefits of joint E.U. action.""

Merkels Ascent How a smart and talented woman overcame numerous obstacles on her way to leading Germany. THE CHANCELLOR The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel By Kati Marton Illustrated. 368 pp. Simon & Schuster. $30.
IN 1852, RICHARD WAGNER SENT a lengthy letter to Franz Liszt about the sorceress Ortrud in his opera ""Lohengrin."" He declared that she never experiences love because ""politics are her essence. A political man is repulsive, but a political woman is horrible. This horror I had to represent.... In history there are no more cruel phenomena than political women."" Whether Angela Merkel, an avid Wagner fan, is familiar with this vituperative statement is unclear, but its sentiments would hardly come as a surprise to her. After the Christian Democratic chancellor Helmut Kohl plucked her from obscurity to become minister for women and youth in 1991, Merkel soon encountered the longstanding aversion to powerful women in German politics, let alone ones from the former East. The national media routinely referred to ""Kohl's little girl"" and mocked her appearance. In the patriarchal Christian Democratic Party itself, a group of promising young men formed a secret pact in the early 1990 s to try to impede her. Over a decade later, the Social Democratic chancellor Gerhard Schröder taunted her as ""not commanding, pathetic.""
Yet the reserved and taciturn Merkel unerringly won out and served four successive terms as Germany's first female chancellor, rivaling the tenures of conservative colossi like Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of postwar Germany, and Kohl, the father of reunification in 1990. By the time Merkel stepped down, she was the world's most trusted leader.
How did she do it? In ""The Chancellor,"" Kati Marton carefully traces Merkel's journey from the hinterlands of East Germany to the center of power in Berlin. A fluent writer, Marton seeks to unravel the Merkel mystery by penetrating the cordon sanitaire that she has erected around her personal life.
Marton's biography builds on an authorized one by the German journalist Stefan Kornelius, which appeared in English in 2014. Marton's ambitious account relies on wide reading in German sources, including interviews Merkel gave from 1990 until she became chancellor in 2005; numerous conversations with Merkel's mentors, friends and colleagues; and background interviews with several members of her inner circle. She relates how her ""own encounters with Merkel, dating from 2001, though not formal interviews,"" enhanced her understanding of the chancellor.
Marton, who was married to the late Richard Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany, is the author of numerous books, including a widely acclaimed history of her Hungarian parents, ""Enemies of the People."" She explains at the outset that her own childhood in Soviet-occupied Hungary helped her to fathom Merkel's life and career, emphasizing that Merkel's upbringing in a police state forms the key to her ""supreme public reticence"" and ability to camouflage her views. The result is a masterpiece of discernment and insight.
Some of Marton's most arresting passages center on the early years. Merkel was born Angela Kasner on July 17,1954, in Hamburg. Two months later her mother, Herlind Kasner, traveled with her newborn to the German Democratic Republic tojóin her husband, Horst, a Lutheran minister who had answered the call to serve the flock in the officially atheist East. It was a punishing existence. The Stasi was ubiquitous and the Kasners lived in an isolated compound of buildings belonging to the church called Waldhof in the little town of Templin. Merkel harbored no illusions about her homeland. ""Later,"" Marton writes, ""Merkel would call the country of her youth a Lager, a word used generally to describe concentration camps.""
Merkel sought a personal escape route by immersing herself in books and nature. One inspiration was Marie Curie, whose credo Merkel adopted for herself: ""Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."" Another was the Bible. According to Marton, ""the young girl became as familiar with figures from the Old and New Testaments as other children were with characters from 'Grimms' Fairy Tales.'"" As a teenager Merkel stood out for her keen intelligence, winning the Russian Language Olympics in East Germany. Marton reports that she also secretly read a rare copy of the Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov's courageous 1968 essay decrying nuclear weapons and the arms race.
At the same time, Merkel joined the Communist Young Pioneers group. According to Marton, ""Angela learned to navigate between worlds: singing Lutheran hymns in church, and miming Vladimir Lenin's praises in school."" Her close friend Michael Schindhelm recalled that he and Merkel learned ""from our Protestant parents how to keep our distance from the state, to put on disguises when the state came too close and to take off the disguises when the state was absent.""
Studying physics at Leipzig University, a discipline the state could not deform with Marxist-Leninist ideology, offered a promising avenue for her zeal for knowledge. Marton points out that Merkel also wished to further her moral education. Through friends in the Lutheran Church, she managed to procure a copy of the West German president Richard von Weizsacker's historic commemoration of the 40 th anniversary of the end of World War II. Its forthrightness about German crimes and guilt left a deep impression upon Merkel, particularly because East Germany steadfastly abjured any obligation for the Nazi past. The party line was to glorify Communists as the real victims of the Third Reich and to defame Israel. According to Marton, ""for the rest of her life, the Shoah - as she has always referred to the Holocaust - would be central to her leadership and to her conviction that Germany's debt to the Jewish people was permanent.""
In 1977 she married Ulrich Merkel, a fellow physicist, and divorced him in 1982. (She married her second husband, Joachim Sauer, in 1998.) With East Germany's collapse in 1989, Merkel became a member of a party called Democratic Awakening, which eventually merged with the Christian Democrats of the West. From the outset of her entry into politics, Merkel prized cool logic over emotion, observing that ""I often feel physically bothered in the presence of men, for whom the discussion isn't about facts but only who can threaten the other more effectively."" Marton notes that Merkel's male mentors and rivals alike fell by the wayside as she ascended: ""Although she may not have torched her rivals directly, she also never ran for the fire hose as they were self-immolating."" This is putting it mildly. In the case of her benefactor Helmut Kohl, Merkel encouraged his opponents after he was exposed in 1999 for accepting secret campaign donations. Merkel declared, ""It's up to us to take our future in our hands."" Kohl was finished. ""Calling out men for sanctimonious behavior,"" Marton writes, ""has been a source of quiet pleasure for Angela Merkel.""
For all her admiration of Merkel's prodigious talents, Marton has not composed a valentine. She notes that Merkel confronted the Russian president Vladimir Putin over his annexation of Crimea, but chastises her for pursuing the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline with Moscow at the expense of war-torn Ukraine. Toward China, Merkel has also pursued a Realpolitik course, elevating the fortunes of German automakers over any human rights concerns. Marton also zooms in on Merkel's glossy assurance in 2015 that Germany could easily assimilate one million refugees from the Middle East, which triggered a backlash that boosted the Alternative for Germany, a far-right party that espouses a return to unabashed Teutonic traditions. Marton underscores that an aging Germany needs young immigrants, but that ""Merkel missed the opportunity to make a stronger case for her policy - beyond asserting its moral correctness. Winning over hearts and minds is a role she never mastered, not a trivial deficit for a politician.""
Still, Merkel's ""keep calm and carry on"" chancellorship has allowed her to leave behind a stable, prosperous Germany. ""A great deal of what she was able to achieve,"" Marton concludes, ""was notdone inspite of her being a woman but because she was one."" For anyone seeking a guide to Merkel's improbable odyssey, this book is it. □

2584,867703560.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED European officials moved quickly to assert their claim over the leadership of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, suggesting a serious challenge is being mounted by emerging economic powers like China and India that believe the time has come to break Europe's historic grip on the post.   The abrupt resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn late Wednesday night has brought tensions long simmering beneath the surface at the powerful organization to a boil. Nations like Brazil want a more open process that does not see the top position at the I.M.F. granted to a European, as has been the convention since the fund was founded 65 years ago. They hope instead to put forth a credible candidate from the emerging world to reflect its growing economic clout.   ""We must establish meritocracy, so that the person leading the I.M.F. is selected for their merits and not for being European,"" Guido Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, said late Wednesday   China, too, publicly weighed in on the debate, suggesting that achieving a consensus on the successor to Mr. Strauss-Kahn may take several months. ""In principle, we believe that emerging and developing countries should have representation at senior levels,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday, the second such statement in two days.   Politicians from across Europe closed ranks, appearing to coalesce behind Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister, as their preferred candidate to succeed Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who is also French.   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany publicly called for a European to assume the job, arguing that the Continent's festering economic problems required a European to stay in place. German media reported that she favored Ms. Lagarde.   ""Of course, developing nations are within their rights in the medium term to occupy the post of either I.M.F. head or World Bank chief,"" Mrs. Merkel said, according to news reports. ""But I think that in the current situation, with serious problems with the euro and the I.M.F. strongly involved, there is a lot in favor of a European candidate being put forward.""   In Washington, the I.M.F. said the 24-member executive board had begun discussions about the selection process for the new managing director. The board is scheduled to hold its regular weekly meeting on Friday when the timetable for succession, like deadlines for nominations, may be discussed. Countries will nominate their candidates, and then the board will vote, with large financial contributors like the United States and Japan getting a bigger share of voting rights. The entire process could take months, as it has in the past.   But the real negotiations and horse-trading have already shifted back to national capitals; one issue being discussed is whether a European would serve out the remaining year and a half of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's term, before handing over to a candidate from the emerging nations, or, more likely, whether a new head should be elected to serve a full five-year term.   President Nicolas Sarkozy of France spoke with Mrs. Merkel by phone Wednesday and will speak with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain on Friday about succession, said an official in Mr. Sarkozy's office who spoke on condition of anonymity. President Obama and other heads of the Group of 8 industrial powers will also discuss the matter when they meet in Deauville, France, next week, the official said.   Support from the United States is crucial. At 16 percent, it has the single biggest voting share on the fund's board. Together, the United States and numerous European countries control more than 50 percent of the voting shares.   On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the United States wanted a ""prompt succession,"" perhaps suggesting the United States is interested in promoting a quick changeover that leaves a European in charge and does not disturb the status quo.   But he said the United States also wanted to see an ""open process,"" stopping short of endorsing Europe's claim. The United States faces a sensitive task over the next few months, risking confrontation if it backs a European candidate, leaving room for countries with developing economies to come up with a credible candidate of their own.   ""We haven't taken a position on any candidate,"" Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said in a speech in Washington. ""What is important at this juncture is that we move quickly to an open process.""   John Lipsky, acting managing director of the International Monetary Fund, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that the fund had continued to function effectively this week despite the turmoil that followed the arrest of its managing director.   ""To think that the I.M.F. depends on one person is an illusion,"" Mr. Lipsky said. ""We can see already this week that the fund has been able to move forward in important areas,"" including working on policies in Ireland, Greece, Egypt and Portugal.   Mr. Strauss-Kahn's resignation comes at a tricky time for the United States, which by convention has taken the No. 2 job at the fund while occupying the most senior position at the World Bank.   The presidency of the World Bank comes up for election next year. Mr. Lipsky had already announced he planned to leave the I.M.F. in August.   Analysts say the United States wants to ensure that an American remains at the top of the World Bank and in the deputy position at the fund -- the name of David Lipton, currently senior director for international economics in the White House, has been floated -- but question whether it can credibly argue for a switch of the top job to the emerging world and still keep its claim on these positions.   Currently, several names are in the frame from emerging-market economics. But the effort may be hampered if the countries fail to put forward a single strong candidate.   The leading candidate from the emerging world, many analysts suggest, may be Kemal Dervis, a former finance minister of Turkey. Mr. Dervis is credited with rescuing the Turkish economy after it was hit by a devastating financial crisis in 2001. Before that, Mr. Dervis worked at the World Bank for 24 years.   Other possible candidates include Arminio Fraga Neto, former governor of the central bank of Brazil; Tharman Shanmugaratnam, finance minister of Singapore; Agustin Carstens, governor of the central bank of Mexico; and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of India's planning commission.   China's role will also be important. According to Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell and a 17-year veteran of the fund, China might actually benefit if no single candidate comes forward from the emerging world. Instead, he suggested, once a European is in place as managing director, China could push for a more formal role -- perhaps deputy managing director, for its highest-ranking official, Zhu Min, now special adviser to the managing director.   The whole process, however, could take three or four months. When Mr. Strauss-Kahn, for example, was proposed in 2007, the selection took more than two months as he flew around the world garnering support and votes, even after the United States said it would support a prominent European for the post. He was formally nominated by Germany, and the board settled on him by consensus.   Ms. Lagarde is one of Europe's most highly regarded economic officials. The former head of the Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie, she is as connected and as respected in Washington and on Wall Street as in Europe.   One of the most difficult issues facing the I.M.F. these days lies in what to do about China's major intervention in currency markets to slow the rise of the renminbi. Beijing's currency policy has helped make Chinese exports more competitive, but it has angered countries that have large trade deficits with China or that have been losing foreign markets to China -- notably the United States, Southern Europe, India and Southeast Asia.   As France's finance minister, Ms. Lagarde has been reluctant to question Chinese policies. During a visit to Beijing and Hong Kong in October 2009 -- at a time when China was not allowing the renminbi to rise against the dollar -- she said at two news conferences that the value of the renminbi was a question of China's sovereignty, and declined to offer any criticism of China. But in the same breath, she called for the United States to maintain the value of the dollar. Correction: May 26, 2011, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Thursday about Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister who is a candidate to head the International Monetary Fund, misstated the length of time she lived in the United States. It was six years, from 1999 to 2005; not 25 years, though she was with the Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie for nearly 25 years. The error was repeated in an article on Friday about an international dispute over whether to install a leader from Europe or an emerging-market nation as head of the fund.

1492,1011364495.xml,"      There are several reasons Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, will soon be vacating the Elysee Palace. His colorful lifestyle cost him votes on the right, and his pandering to the immigrant bashers cost him votes on the left. But the overwhelming reason for his loss in Sunday's election was voters' resentment at the painful, counterproductive austerity policies crafted by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and warmly endorsed by Mr. Sarkozy as the antidote to Europe's financial crises.    Francois Hollande, the unpreposessing Socialist candidate who won a narrow victory, instead called for channeling the government's spending and taxing powers toward recovery and economic growth.    The French were not alone in rejecting politicians who favor sharp reductions in government spending as the one-size-fits-all answer to the region's problems. In Greece's parliamentary elections Sunday, voters resoundingly defeated candidates from the two major political parties that earlier this year had agreed to a rescue package -- dictated largely by Germany -- that required harsh, growth-killing spending cuts in exchange for $171 billion in emergency loans.    And there was a dark side to the election that cannot be ignored. For the first time, the far-right group Golden Dawn, whose xenophobic members perform Nazi salutes, won enough votes to enter Parliament with 21 seats.    There is still no sign that Ms. Merkel is ready to acknowledge that relentless austerity is not working. On Monday, she welcomed Mr. Hollande's election, saying that ""growth"" is necessary to ""progress,"" but she insisted that the austerity pact she designed with Mr. Sarkozy's help was ""not negotiable.""    Mr. Hollande has already made clear that he intends to restructure France's economic policies, attacking the country's deficit by raising taxes on the rich and big corporations while using government programs to stimulate growth and create more jobs. In his victory address, he also vowed to seek a new pact and a ""new direction"" for Europe. He obviously grasps a central truth that seems to have eluded German politicians: that while Greece and others must reform their labor markets and wrestle their budgets under control, they cannot repay their debts unless they are also allowed to grow.    The United States economy is doing better than most of Europe. But the austerity debate continues here, too. So is there a warning for House Republicans who have endorsed Representative Paul Ryan's draconian budget? And for Mitt Romney, their party's presumptive presidential nominee? Controlling deficits is important, but too much austerity too soon will stall a recovery, or worse, and wreak havoc on lives. Europe's grim growth numbers prove that. And voters in Europe have figured it out.       ",2012-05-08
2742,1651287087.xml,"       FRANKFURT --  Greece's efforts to renegotiate its bailout suffered a serious setback on Wednesday when the European Central Bank shut off a major source of lending for the country's troubled financial institutions. The central bank decided that it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral for loans, saying that it was not confident the country could meet its bailout requirements. The move raises the stakes for Greece, indicating that the European Central Bank, at least, is not prepared to bend its rules to accommodate the country's newly elected government. It is also a blow to the country's hard-pressed banks, which have used their holdings of Greek government bonds to borrow from the central bank at a cheap interest rate of 0.05 percent. Now Greek banks, facing signs of a capital flight, will have to rely on emergency cash from another program. As they met with European leaders and policy makers on Wednesday, Alexis Tsipras, the new Greek prime minister, and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, were hoping to build support for an anti-austerity plan for the beleaguered country. They also wanted to persuade the E.C.B. to continue backing emergency funding to some of Greece's largest banks. Their tour was an opportunity for the new leftist leaders and the major figures in eurozone politics to size up one another and stake out positions before negotiations that are likely to take weeks if not months. Eurozone leaders used the meetings to tutor the relatively inexperienced Greeks in the complexities of European politics and the constraints that the new government faces financially and politically. Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Varoufakis seemed to be doing their best to come across as responsible, reasonable people, but determined to strike a better deal for their suffering countrymen. ""Our goal is to respect the people's sovereignty in Greece and the clear mandate of our people -- at the same time we respect the rules of the European Union,"" Mr. Tsipras said at a midday news conference in Brussels with Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament. ""We want to recorrect this framework -- not to smash this framework,"" Mr. Tsipras said, apparently referring to European Union rules underpinning the eurozone. Mr. Varoufakis met with the president of the E.C.B., Mario Draghi, hours before the bank's policy-setting body discussed the emergency loans to Greek lenders. The central bank's governing council did endorse giving Greek banks access to funds under a program known as Emergency Liquidity Assistance. Approval of the emergency funds was seen as a near-certainty because without it some Greek banks might fail, precipitating a crisis that could infect other countries. But beginning on Feb. 11, banks will no longer be able to use their holdings of Greek government bonds to borrow at more favorable rates. Previously, Greek debt had been exempt from rules prohibiting poorly rated bonds from being used as collateral. While the decision applies to all banks in the eurozone, it will hit Greek banks hardest because of their large holdings of their own country's debt. In its decision, the central bank suggested it had lost confidence in Greece's ability to meet the terms of its bailout set by other European countries and the International Monetary Fund, which include spending limits, sale of state assets and steps meant to improve the performance of the economy. The decision ""is based on the fact that it is currently not possible to assume a successful conclusion of the program review,"" the E.C.B. said in a statement. The central bank also barred Greek bonds as collateral in 2012 after the country negotiated a write-down of some of its debt. The central bank began accepting the bonds again after new bailout terms were reached. That experience suggests that if Greece negotiates a new program, the central bank would accept the bonds again. In a statement, the Greek Finance Ministry said the E.C.B.'s decision ""puts pressure on the Eurogroup to proceed quickly to a new mutually beneficial agreement between Greece and its creditors,"" referring to the group of eurozone finance ministers. The ministry concluded that the Greek government ""is widening daily its circle of negotiations with partners and institutions to which it belongs, remains steady on its goals of social salvation which the Greek people approved with their vote and is consulting with the aim of designing a European policy which will definitively end the self-fueling crisis of the Greek social economy."" The E.C.B. did not comment on the meeting between Mr. Draghi and Mr. Varoufakis earlier in the day. The Greek finance minister said outside the central bank headquarters afterward that he and Mr. Draghi had held ""a very fruitful discussion"" and ""established an excellent line of communication."" Mr. Varoufakis said he had told Mr. Draghi of ""our government's utter and unwavering determination that it can't possibly be business as usual in Greece."" The finance minister also said Greece would demand changes in the bailout program, which has been ""fueling a debt deflationary crisis in our nation, thus causing a major humanitarian crisis."" Still, he said the meeting ""gives me a great encouragement for the future."" A person with knowledge of the discussion, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential, said that Mr. Draghi had explained the rules that the central bank must operate under and urged the new government to engage ""constructively and speedily"" with the eurozone group of finance ministers ""to ensure continued financial stability."" The Greek leaders face an enormous challenge to persuade the rest of Europe to back away from the budgetary rigor that Germany, the biggest contributor to the bailout, insists upon. So far there is every sign that Mr. Tsipras will need to commit his country to further reform -- and probably accept an extension of the current bailout program -- if he is to win any of the debt relief that he has pledged to deliver. Leaders in Brussels, Berlin and Paris are making every effort to start a dialogue with Mr. Tsipras to avoid Greece becoming the first country to leave the euro. Such an outcome could effectively break apart the single currency union and usher in a period of greater economic instability if investors turn on other members of the eurozone with weak economies. After meeting with Mr. Tsipras in Brussels on Wednesday morning, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents national leaders of European Union member governments, said that any negotiations over financial assistance for Greece would take place within the Eurogroup. ""They will be difficult"" and will require ""cooperation and dialogue as well as determined efforts by Greece,"" Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, said. Mr. Varoufakis continued on to Berlin later on Wednesday for a meeting scheduled for Thursday morning with Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister. Mr. Varoufakis said he was ""extremely eager"" to meet with Mr. Schäuble, whom he called ""the intellectual force behind the project of European Monetary Union."" Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said in Berlin that she was looking forward to meeting Mr. Tsipras next week at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels. But she said it was up to Greece to make proposals. ""Now is really the moment,"" Ms. Merkel said, ""when Greece must say exactly what its ideas are.""

3133,434146462.xml,"      An Opportunity    To Regain Luster   Ben Bernanke is not exactly getting a reward for failure. Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,  is being renominated  for a second term as the world's most powerful central banker.    He made one big mistake in his first term, but a bigger success is still possible. If that's not forthcoming, there will be nothing rewarding about staying in office.    Mr. Bernanke's greatest failure was intellectual. He did not comprehend the economic risks of modern financial practices. He supported the enthusiasm for financial deregulation and innovation shown by Alan Greenspan, his predecessor. In 2004, he hailed the ""macroeconomic flexibility and stability"" provided by ""the increased depth and sophistication of financial markets"" and increased openness to  international capital flows.    The theoretical underestimation probably encouraged Mr. Bernanke to excessive optimism as the financial crisis developed. In May 2007, when the subprime mortgage market was crumbling, the Fed believed the effect on the broader housing market would be ""limited"" with no ""significant spillovers"" to the economy or even the financial system.    In October of that year, with money markets tightening, Mr. Bernanke could not have been clearer: ""The banking system is healthy.""    He was spectacularly wrong. Under his watch, the so-called Great Moderation --  the years of steady growth and low inflation around the world -- developed into the worst financial crisis and recession in six decades. Mr. Bernanke's Fed did, at least, respond aggressively with an array of unprecedented policies.    President Obama was presumably not thinking about Mr. Bernanke's discredited confidence when he decided to name him to a second four-year term. Mr. Obama knows that jittery investors want continuity. Even if the president desired change, he would have struggled to find a distinguished economist with a greatly different agenda.    Mr. Bernanke the activist could yet prove much more successful than Mr. Bernanke the optimist. Gross domestic product is still depressed, the financial system is still on government life support and the Fed's policy interest rate and balance sheet are still at abnormal levels.    A better judgment should be possible by the time Mr. Bernanke's new term expires in 2014. So he should be around to take the glory,  or feel the shame.   G.M. Walks Fine Line   It's the best idea that's come up so far about Opel. Keep it in the house.    Opel, the troubled European division of General Motors, was put on the block this year when its parent company's own future was in doubt.    Since then, the skies have cleared somewhat, after the United States government took over  G.M. and the company emerged quickly from  bankruptcy.   After three months of protracted negotiations, G.M. doesn't seem happy with any of the potential buyers' terms. One reason is that it wants to keep strong industrial and technological ties to Opel. So why not go back to the drawing board and keep the division?   The problem with this option is that it omits the 800-pound gorilla monitoring the proceedings: Germany, home to about half of Opel's work force. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has pledged support to Opel  with some 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of financial guarantees.    It also extended the company a bridge loan of 1.5 billion euros in May when G.M. entered into talks with the Canadian car-parts maker Magna International. But G.M. and Magna still haven't come to an agreement, and Germany is frowning on other suitors.   The Magna bid is largely financed by Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, which has ties to the ailing Russian car manufacturer Gaz. G.M.'s board is balking both at technology transfers to Russia and possible future competition from Opel on the Russian market. Germany, on the other hand, is favoring the Magna bid because it would save more jobs.   Whatever the outcome of the talks, it's hard to see how G.M., based in Detroit, could afford to antagonize Germany's government and unions while keeping its hat in hand for public money. The carmaker has already ruffled German feathers by not settling the Opel crisis sooner. Germany's general elections will be held on Sept. 27, and Mrs. Merkel wants to be able to show voters some kind of long-term solution to Opel's woes.    It may be that by dangling yet another solution to the problem, G.M. simply wants to extract better terms from Magna. But the company may also be playing with fire.

2565,433953136.xml,"      President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will inaugurate on Saturday a memorial complex dedicated to Charles de Gaulle, in his hometown, Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, where he lived with his family and was buried. The $27 million, 43,000-square-foot museum will feature a reconstitution of a World War I trench as well a section of the Libyan desert where Free French soldiers had their first victories in 1941. De Gaulle's home has been traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Franco-German reconciliation. ""The memorial is a French and German place of memory and so it is European as well,"" said Sharon Elbaz, a director of the Charles de Gaulle foundation.

600,1978160065.xml,"On the slope of a thickly forested Czech mountain, three men in hard hats and mud-spattered fluorescent vests dig for the metal that could power a new industrial revolution.They watch carefully as a mobile rig, mounted on tank treads, hammers and spins a drill bit hundreds of yards into the bedrock. Water gushes from the bore as the bit punctures an underground spring.
The men are prospecting for new sources of lithium, a raw material now found primarily in China and Chile that could become as important to the auto industry as oil is now.
Faster than anyone expected, electric cars are becoming as economical and practical as cars with conventional engines. Prices for lithium-ion batteries are plummeting, while technical advances are increasing driving ranges and cutting recharging times.
""Once the trend gets going, it can happen very fast,"" said Guido Jouret, chief digital officer at ABB, an electronics company based in Zurich whose businesses include constructing charging stations.
But this electric-car future is still missing some pieces. Some crucial raw materials are scarce. There are not enough places to recharge. Battery-powered cars still cost thousands of dollars more than many gasoline vehicles.
Car companies are racing to overcome these obstacles. They, and the millions of people they employ, risk becoming irrelevant.
""Many people are nervous about how fast this is coming and how much they have to invest,"" said Norbert Dressler, a senior partner at Roland Berger in Stuttgart, Germany, who advises the auto industry.
Here's a look at what needs to happen before electric cars take over the world.
The cost of building motors and components will have to continue to decrease.
______
Price of an electric car powertrain:
$16,000
Price of a conventional car powertrain:
$6,000
______
Electric cars will go mainstream when the cost of the powertrain -- the motor and other guts that make the vehicle move -- is the same as owning cars that burn gasoline or diesel. How soon that day arrives is almost solely a function of the price of batteries.
Battery prices, measured by the power they produce, have already fallen by more than half since 2011, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The unexpectedly rapid drop in prices has sped up the timetable.
Merrill Lynch analysts now expect electric vehicles in the United States will be cheaper than their traditional counterparts by 2024. Just a year ago, they estimated it would take until 2030.
One reason battery costs are falling is that manufacturers are ramping up production. The greater the supply, the lower the price.
Car companies like Daimler are getting into the battery business. Daimler has invested $590 million in a new battery plant in Kamenz, a sleepy city in a rural part of eastern Germany.
""This is an important investment in the future,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel told Daimler executives and other dignitaries at a groundbreaking in May. Within a few months, workers had erected prefabricated concrete walls for the enormous new building and assembled the roof girders.
""We could buy batteries,"" said Jupp Kaufer, head of quality at Accumotive, Daimler's battery unit.
But Daimler would rather earn the profits than pay them to a supplier like Samsung or Panasonic. ""The battery is a crucial part of the vehicle,"" Mr. Kaufer said as he walked through the assembly line of another factory in Kamenz that is already running at capacity.
There must be a steady, affordable supply of the resources required to make batteries.
______
Price of cobalt:
Up 115 percent this year
Price of lithium:
Up 45 percent
Price of graphite:
Up 30 percent
______
Carmakers are racing to secure the essential ingredients in batteries like cobalt, lithium and graphite. They need to avoid shortages that would drive prices too high, making electric vehicles unaffordable.
But manufacturers are also dealing with a geopolitical dimension. Three-quarters of the world's reserves of lithium, a crucial ingredient in the most common kind of electric car battery, are in China and Chile, according to the United States Geological Survey. As demand surges, China could deploy its natural resources as a diplomatic cudgel the same way that Saudi Arabia uses oil.
The risk that a few countries could control most of the ingredients for electric car batteries is what spurred the drilling crew to the mountainside in Cinovec in the Czech Republic. As early as the 1300s, miners dug tin -- ""cin"" in Czech -- from the mountains around the town. Later, the area was an important source of tungsten, but the last shaft closed in 1993. Demand for lithium has made mining in the area attractive again.
European Metals Holdings Ltd., an Australian company, is drilling into the bedrock and hauling out core samples to map deposits. The company plans to complete a feasibility study next year and begin mining and processing the ore in Cinovec soon after.
""We are already in touch with some battery makers,"" Richard Pavlik, manager of a European Metals subsidiary overseeing the work in Cinovec, said as he watched the drilling crew.
As for cobalt, it comes primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the world's most war-torn and unstable countries. Illegal mining operations there have been accused of using child labor.
Mining companies are hunting for sources in less problematic locations. First Cobalt, based in Toronto, has announced plans to reopen a former silver and cobalt mine in the aptly named town of Cobalt, Ontario. ""We think we are at a point of no return with electric vehicles,"" said Trent Mell, the company's chief executive.
More charging stations will need to be built, and they'll need to charge faster.
______
Average range of a gasoline-powered car:
475 miles
Average range of an electric vehicle:
190 miles
______
Even when people can buy an electric car for the same price or less than a gasoline model, they face another problem: where to plug it in. And they won't want to wait all day for the car to recharge.
Electric cars will become commonplace once there is a dense network of high-voltage charging stations where drivers can refill their batteries in the time it takes to use the restroom and drink a cup of coffee.
At the moment, a cross-country drive in an electric car is an adventure.
Edwin Stafford, a professor of marketing at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, carefully plotted his charging stops before setting out recently in his Tesla S for Berkeley, Calif., with his family.
Tesla S owners have free access to Tesla charging stations and can use the waiting time to have a meal or shop. In half an hour, a high voltage Tesla ""supercharger"" can supply enough juice to travel 170 miles, according to Tesla. But the amenities at charging stations varied, Mr. Stafford said.
At one in Nevada, the only nearby business was a casino, he said. At another, the charging apparatus was blocked by an illegally parked truck. Close to the Bay Area, there were sometimes lines of other Tesla owners waiting to charge, he added.
But an array of start-ups and established companies like ABB are busy installing charging stations around the world, and they are on their way to becoming commonplace. There are already about 16,000 public charging stations in the United States, up from a few hundred in 2010. That compares with about 112,000 gas stations.
Surprisingly, Volkswagen's emissions scandal has accelerated the rollout. As part of its settlement with diesel owners in the United States who bought cars with illegal software, Volkswagen agreed to spend $2 billion to promote electric cars and build infrastructure. Electrify America, a company established to invest the settlement money, plans to install more than 2,000 fast chargers nationwide by mid-2019 in a first phase, with thousands more to follow.
Drivers will have to shed their attachment to the sound, smell and feel of gas-powered engines.
______
time from 0 to 60 m.p.h., Audi A8:
4 seconds
time from 0 to 60 m.p.h., Tesla S:
2.3 seconds
______
One of the biggest barriers for electric vehicles is psychological. People are used to internal combustion engines and the sensations that go with them -- the odor of the fuel, the shifting of the transmission, the sound of the engine as the car accelerates.
Electric cars have a different personality that people need to get their heads around before they will buy one.
They may be pleasantly surprised. The physics of electric motors give them exceptional acceleration. A $135,000 Tesla S clocked by Motor Trend magazine went from zero to 60 miles per hour faster than Ferraris, Lamborghinis or Porsches costing hundreds of thousands of dollars more.
Electric cars are quiet, nearly vibration free and they don't smell like gasoline or exhaust. They don't need oil changes. They cost less to operate -- about 1 cent per mile compared to 10 cents per mile for a gasoline-powered car. Electric cars hug the road because heavy battery packs, typically arrayed underneath the passenger compartment, provide low centers of gravity and high stability.
""There is no question that an electric car gives you significantly better performance,"" Mr. Stafford said. ""I don't think the mainstream driver is going to understand that unless they experience it.""
The car industry will have to leave some of its old methods of production by the side of the road.
______
Carmakers' investment in electric vehicles:
$100 billion by 2020
Carmakers' annual profit:
$400 billion
______
The industry is racing to invest in the future, as electric cars portend sweeping economic and societal changes. The transition will be painful for traditional carmakers and suppliers, potentially even catastrophic.
Electric cars have about 25 percent fewer parts than conventional autos. Companies that make engine parts like pistons, fuel injection systems or spark plugs will have to find new products to sell, or die. Some workers' skills will no longer be needed.
Governments will lose fuel tax revenues. Filling stations and auto repair shops will go out of business. To compete with Tesla, which allows customers to buy cars online, car companies will have to radically streamline their dealership networks.
""The cake will be smaller,"" said Volkmar Denner, the chief executive of Bosch, the auto parts maker.
Established carmakers will face new competitors taking advantage of the technology shift to break into the market. Chinese companies are investing heavily in electric cars. Dyson, a British company hitherto known for its innovative vacuum cleaners, has announced plans to develop an electric car.
Big car companies recognize the threat and argue that they can deploy their enormous manufacturing networks to roll out electric vehicles faster than Tesla, which has struggled to meet demand.
""We won't have a problem building one million cars,"" said Herbert Diess, chief executive of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars.
But the automakers' existing expertise -- building internal combustion engines -- will no longer give them a competitive edge.
""They are losing a lot of their intellectual capital,"" said Geoffrey Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School. ""And they have to find a way to replace it.""

1349,871245584.xml,"      PARIS -- A French court moved on Friday to postpone a decision on an investigation of Finance Minister Christine Lagarde over abuse of power charges. This cleared an immediate hurdle to her candidacy to lead the International Monetary Fund, but left possible future legal proceedings hanging over her bid.   The Court of Justice, which oversees ministers' actions in office, said it would delay a decision on whether to look into her handling in 2007 of a court case involving a French tycoon until July 8. That means that there will be no legal clarity on the issue until after the I.M.F. has chosen its next managing director on June 30.   Ms. Lagarde and Agustin Carstens, Mexico's central bank governor, both declared officially Friday that they were running for I.M.F. managing director, beating a deadline of midnight Friday in Washington set by the fund.   Also Friday, Russia nominated Grigori Martchenko, Kazakhstan's central bank president. Mr. Martchenko has acknowledged that Ms. Lagarde, who is backed by European leaders, is the favorite in the race.   South Africa's finance minister, Trevor Manuel, said Friday that he would not run.   Ms. Lagarde traveled to Lisbon on Friday to gather support from African leaders at a meeting of the African Development Bank, the latest in a series of campaign stops she has made to persuade leaders of emerging countries that she should get the job.   These countries have expressed alarm that Europe is aggressively pushing to keep the I.M.F.'s top spot in European hands. But they also appear to be concluding that Ms. Lagarde would have more clout than Mr. Carstens to eventually elevate their own influence at the fund at a time when their economies' growth is outpacing those in the West.   By all accounts, these dynamics make Ms. Lagarde the front-runner for one of the most powerful positions in global finance. But future court action may cast a cloud over those ambitions.   At issue is whether Ms. Lagarde abused her authority as finance minister in one of France's longest-running legal soap operas.   Ms. Lagarde ordered in 2007 that a dispute that had raged in French courts for 14 years between Bernard Tapie, a flamboyant French businessman and friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Credit Lyonnais, a state-owned bank, be referred to a three-person arbitration panel.   Mr. Tapie, a former chief of the Adidas sports empire and a former minister in the Socialist Party who defected to support Mr. Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign, accused Credit Lyonnais in 1993 of cheating him when it oversaw the sale of his stake in Adidas.   It was Mr. Sarkozy who suggested that the finance ministry, which was overseeing the case because Credit Lyonnais was a ward of the French state, move the case to arbitration.   The arbitration panel ultimately awarded Mr. Tapie a settlement of about $580 million, including interest.   Ms. Lagarde defended her decision to remove the case from the French court system, saying it would keep more taxpayer money from being spent to fight the case. The ultimate award to Mr. Tapie came from the state's coffers.   She has also denied accusations that her decision not to appeal the award was a reward for Mr. Tapie's political support of Mr. Sarkozy.   ""I have a clear conscience,"" she said two weeks ago when she announced her candidacy for the I.M.F. post. Ms. Lagarde said she would not withdraw her candidacy even if an investigation were opened.   If the court decides on July 8 not to investigate, all legal proceedings against Ms. Lagarde in the matter would stop.   If it rules otherwise, Ms. Lagarde would have to gird for a possibly lengthy legal process, although she would not necessarily be required to be present in France for the proceedings, said Christopher Mesnooh, a partner specializing in international business law at Field Fisher Waterhouse in Paris.   More important, ""if they take things forward, it means they believe that there is a prima facie case,"" Mr. Mesnooh said. So if Ms. Lagarde does get the I.M.F. post, ""there's still going to be a legal investigation at a very high level that will be taking place in France,"" he said. ""That is not ideal, given what has happened with the last managing director of the I.M.F.""    Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the previous managing director, resigned last month after he was charged with the attempted rape of a hotel maid in New York.   Although Mr. Sarkozy refrained from backing Ms. Lagarde publicly until nearly every other leader in Europe, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, had done so, he defended her recently at the Group of Eight meeting in Deauville, France.   ""The legal risks weighing on the candidacy of Christine Lagarde for the I.M.F. are manageable,"" he said.   Ms. Lagarde, who traveled this past week to Brazil, India and China, is to go to Saudi Arabia on Saturday and Egypt on Sunday. Mr. Carstens, who has said that 12 Latin American countries have endorsed him, plans stops in India and China.   The United States has not backed a candidate, although the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has said that Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Carstens are qualified.

546,880788213.xml,"      PARIS -- Just as European markets seemed to resume their normalcy after the tumult of their sovereign debt crises, the wolves are back at the door.    Two weeks ago, the markets seemed to be on firmer footing after the new bailout of Greece was structured to prevent contagion. But on Tuesday, traders renewed their attacks on Italy and Spain pushing their borrowing costs, at least for now, to the tipping point that led Greece, Ireland and Portugal to apply for bailouts.    Some people now fear that Italy and Spain could run out of cash to meet their debt obligations in a matter of months if, like the others, they are shut out of international markets.   JPMorgan is warning its clients that Italy and Spain have thin margins of safety. The countries ""will run out of cash in September and February respectively, if they lose access to funding markets,"" the investment bank said. Those fears risk leading to ""a self-fulfilling negative spiral,"" the bank added.    The rescue fund negotiated last month as part of the bailout of Greece was intended to increase powers to assist countries that have not been bailed out, like Spain and Italy. It was described by some as a new Marshall Plan for Europe and was supposed to keep those nations safe from the spreading fire and, by extension, cushion the many European and American banks that hold their debt.   However, some skeptics had warned that the fund would not do enough, particularly if larger economies were devoured by the debt crisis. While the economies of Greece, Ireland and Portugal are relatively small, European leaders would face challenges of a different magnitude if Italy and Spain were engulfed by the same forces. For instance, if Italy's economy stalls, higher interest rates could make it too costly to service Italy's heaving debt, which, at 119 percent of gross domestic product, is one of the world's largest.    With many Europeans off for their summer holidays, thin trading conditions may be exaggerating the market's movements this week. Still, the sense of urgency was palpable in Rome, where Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister, held an emergency meeting of the country's financial authorities as interest rates on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond touched a 14-year high of 6.21 percent on Tuesday.    A leadership vacuum at the highest levels of the Italian government has further unnerved investors. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been silent on the debt crisis for nearly a month as he battles a sex scandal and grapples with court cases. He was scheduled to address the matter on Wednesday in a speech on the economy before Parliament.    In Madrid, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero delayed the start of his vacation Tuesday to cope with Spain's problems even as he agreed last week to step down early to take responsibility for Spain's economic crisis.    The yield for the Spanish 10-year bond rose to 6.45 percent, the highest level since Spain joined the euro club, before retreating a bit. The surge is ill-timed because the government needs to raise as much as 3.5 billion euros (nearly $5 billion) in a bond auction Thursday.    The governments of Germany and France, the euro zone's largest economies, can hardly afford a bigger cleanup bill for Europe's debt crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France hinted as much last month, telling Mr. Berlusconi in separate brief conversations that they felt sure he would do the right thing for the economy, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.    Both Italy and Spain still need to tackle a mountain of debt and show they are making real progress toward straightening out their finances. Until that happens, investors are likely to keep driving their borrowing costs higher.    Markets are also unnerved by the prospect that creditors would share additional pain should other countries go the way of Greece. With German and French politicians pressured to show that taxpayers will not be the only ones saddled with the bailout costs, banks in those countries agreed to take some losses in the most recent bailout of Greece.    But investors have become much more nervous about the capacity of banks to take larger losses on Italian, Spanish, Irish or Portuguese debt, should such a situation arise. That has helped fan the contagion and raised the possibility of a highly expensive bank rescue operation by European taxpayers.    ""The problem is we have not stopped the contagion that is putting pressure on Italy and Spain,"" said a senior European finance official involved in the rescue programs, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""We would be confronted with enormous problems if things got worse.""    Except for German bonds, Italian debt is more widely held by European banks than any other government obligation. A default there could devastate Europe's financial system.    Europe's 90 largest banks collectively hold Italian debt with a face value of 326 billion euros, according to data collected by the European Banking Authority. That sum overshadows the 90 billion euros in Greek debt held by the largest banks. It is also much larger than European banks' holdings of Spanish or United States debt, which in both cases is about 287 billion euros.    Italian banks are by far the most exposed to their country's debt, and many have suffered sharp declines in their share price in the last month. For instance, UniCredit holds 49 billion euros, according to the banking authority.    BNP Paribas in France holds 28 billion in Italian debt euros and in Britain, HSBC has 9.9 billion euros in Italian debt and Barclays has 9.4 billion euros. By comparison, American banks hold $14.38 billion worth of Italian debt.    In a statement after the emergency meeting in Rome, officials blamed ""international uncertainties"" for their problems rather than Italy's economic fundamentals. Declaring the country's banks ""solid,"" they nonetheless said they would keep the situation ""under constant observation.""    Michael T. Darda, the chief economist at the hedge fund MKM Partners, said higher government bond yields could reduce growth in both countries, raising expectations of default, and inviting even higher yields and wider gaps in comparison with German bonds, the European benchmark.    European officials hoped they would at least be able to escape for their August vacations before returning to the line of fire. But with those kind of views spreading, traders in government debt may not give them much time to enjoy themselves.    ""There are two types of players in the market, those who move out of fear and those who move out of greed,"" said the senior European finance official. ""And right now, we are seeing all of them move in the same direction.""    Credit: LIZ ALDERMAN AND MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Matthew Saltmarsh from London.

2653,675152540.xml,"      BERLIN -- A stampede inside a tunnel at a popular techno music festival killed 18 people and injured dozens more on Saturday, police officials said.    It was unclear exactly what set off the panic among the throngs of young people squeezing into the tunnel leading to festival grounds in the western German city of Duisburg, but the police said they had tried to close off the area because of overcrowding just before the stampede.    The police reported telling the crowd to turn around and walk in the other direction before the panic broke out.    The scene was so chaotic that other festival attendees, unaware of the deaths, kept dancing and listening to music for some time, news services said.    Rescuers reported delays in reaching injured people because of the size of the crowd. News reports said more than a million people were attending the festival.   ""It's a horror situation, especially because rescuers cannot get through to those injured,"" Thomas Muenten, a reporter for ZDF, the German public television channel, said in the early evening. ""The people literally trampled each other on the way into this tunnel.""   Photos and television images of the scene after the crush showed many young people looking dazed, with personal items that had been left behind  scattered around them.   ""There were piles of injured on the ground, some being resuscitated, others dead and covered with sheets,"" said Isabel Schloesser, 18, according to Reuters. ""It was way too full in the afternoon. Everyone wanted to get in.""   The music event, called the Love Parade, is one of Europe's biggest electronic music gatherings, attracting young people from many countries.    Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences and said she was ""horrified that young people went to party and were instead met by death and injuries.""    The police said thousands of young people were still waiting to get into the festival when officers closed the area. At one point, according to witnesses, it was impossible for people to move forward or backward in or near the tunnel.    As people felt stuck, the witnesses said, they panicked. ""At some point the column of people got stuck, probably because it was closed up front and we saw that the first people were already lying on the ground,"" Udo Sandhofer  told the N-TV commercial television channel.    But an emergency services official, Wolfgang Rabe, told ARD television that some people had tried to enter the area by climbing a fence along a ramp and fell, possibly starting the panic, Reuters reported.   The Love Parade, started in 1989 as a peace demonstration, was held for years in  Berlin, but has been held in the industrial Ruhr region of western Germany since 2007.    In 2000, at least eight people were crushed to death and scores more were injured at a rock festival in Roskilde, Denmark, when  fans rushed the stage during a Pearl Jam concert.

213,288277357.xml,"      Singapore   THE dream of monetary union across Europe has turned into a nightmare. Led by France and Germany, European countries have decided to spend colossal sums of taxpayers' money they cannot afford to heal mounting internal disparities they cannot conceal to shore up an edifice many believe cannot stand. On Monday, that skepticism briefly pulled the value of the euro down to a four-year low against the dollar.    A little over a week ago, European Union leaders approved a rescue package worth  750 billion euros (nearly $1 trillion)  for weaker members like Greece, Portugal and Spain, backed by the International Monetary Fund and the American government. The present crisis extends well beyond its immediate causes: bad decisions in Athens, lack of European leadership and a poor economy. These are but the latest twists in a drama that began more than two decades ago.    The underlying story  of how 16 diverse European currencies were fused into the euro combines the contorted fortunes of two powerful German politicians who sought to tame Europe's past and shape its future, along with a French president who wished to fasten economic shackles around the might of a reunified Germany. Ultimately, too, it is the story of how the Old Continent struggled to break free from the uncertain political and economic embrace of the United States.    The pivotal moment in the formation of Europe's monetary union came in December 1991 at a  meeting in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands. Two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, European leaders set a political path toward a Europe-wide currency  -- a holy grail that had been pursued since the Roman Empire. The new money would complete the European program of liberalized cross-border trade, promote the old dream of political unity, rival the dollar as an international reserve currency and -- the most complicated objective -- prevent an enlarged Germany's domination of Europe by bringing its currency under European control. The mighty Deutsche mark needed to be cast into the furnace of European unity and forged into the euro.   In the vanguard of the effort was none other than Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man who had driven German reunification with miraculous speed. He knew he had to enshrine the larger Germany in a new European order to ease  its neighbors' fears. The euro would be the monetary equivalent of the ugly yet necessary military compact between NATO and the Warsaw Pact that supervised East and West Germany after World War II.   To his credit, just before the Maastricht meeting, Chancellor Kohl  noted that a monetary union without a corresponding political union would be ""a castle in the air."" His remark echoed the concerns of the Bundesbank, his country's statutorily independent central bank, that unless it involved greater political and economic anti-inflationary discipline and solidarity among weaker and stronger states, a monetary union would be doomed.    Of course, the Bundesbank was also reluctant to cede  its mastery of European monetary affairs to a  new European Central Bank. And ordinary Germans were not eager to give up the mark, the guarantor of their prosperity.   Yet Mr. Kohl fought for the monetary union, and  the euro started on schedule, three months after he was voted out of office. (Eleven countries adopted the currency on Jan. 1, 1999; five more, including Greece, joined later.)   Mr. Kohl's partner in redrawing the contours of Europe was President Francois Mitterrand of France, who provided Mr. Kohl with the political incentive to create the monetary union, arguing that unified Germany had to participate in deeper European integration. Mr. Kohl agreed, but egged on by the Bundesbank applied conditions that to this day remain deeply irksome to France -- principally that the new currency had to be run by a European Central Bank that would be at least as independent as the Bundesbank.    The deeply held French view was that the state, not unelected central bankers, should have ultimate power over a nation's money.  Shortly before he died in 1996, Mitterrand told a confidant that his agreeing  to the independence of the European Central Bank had been a terrible error.    The third principal character in the story of the euro is Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's 67-year-old finance minister -- a courageous,  quick-thinking man suspended between the past and the present, between hope and tragedy. A paraplegic since being shot by a deranged assailant at an election rally in 1990, Mr. Schauble served as Mr. Kohl's Chancellery minister, applying connivance and calculation in dealings with East Germany and, later, as interior minister, deftly negotiating the 1990 reunification treaty. It was Mr. Schauble who, with forbearance and persistence, played a central part in carrying out Mr. Kohl's wish that the new Germany be integrated into a new Europe by the binding power of a common money.   Mr. Schauble is now the key member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, and the euro imbroglio presents him with his most exacting test. Yet during recent months of mounting tension caused by the debts of the southern members of the euro zone, he has been confined to a hospital bed for weeks on end. (He made it to Brussels earlier this month for a vital finance ministers' meeting, but was rushed to the hospital there after suffering an allergic reaction to medication.) The ministers' decision to offer nearly $1 trillion in aid and guarantees, with taxpayers from Germany bearing the largest share, was made without him.   The huge amount of money aside, the significance of the rescue package  was that, for the first time, power over the European Central Bank started to move to the politicians. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, a longtime critic of the bank's sway, joined forces with another Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to impose political supremacy over the euro zone.    Decisive backing came from President Obama, who on the eve of the Brussels meeting telephoned Mrs. Merkel to warn her that Europe's failure to act could set off another worldwide credit crunch. His intervention was incongruous in the extreme: an American president urging the German chancellor to shore up a currency union that was meant to bolster Europe's financial independence from the United States.   But this is not the only way in which the euro has defied expectations. Germany has long warned that southern euro states, no longer able to improve their competitiveness by devaluing their own currencies, could run into severe financial trouble. The red ink from their increasing trade deficits has been flowing for more than a decade. These countries have borrowed far too much for too long at too cheap interest rates. The current account deficits for Greece and Portugal average an unsustainable 10 percent of gross domestic product.     Yet even as it predicted the trouble, Germany failed to anticipate that the  countries running a trade surplus would inevitably need to finance the southern states' shortfalls. The five most heavily indebted euro members owe German banks an estimated 700 billion euros (nearly $900 billion), and these German surpluses, once regarded abroad as a symbol of great strength, have emerged as a dangerous source of vulnerability. Most sickeningly for the Germans, the indebted nations are likely to say that their debts need to be reduced or restructured in the name of European solidarity.    A German revolt against the attenuated independence of the European Central Bank appears likely, and could jeopardize parliamentary approval for the rescue package. The Germans feel  mistreated  by a monetary system that makes them pay for others' largely self-inflicted misfortunes.   And the trouble is far from over. The austerity programs for errant southern states ordained by European governments and the International Monetary Fund are likely to lead to severe unemployment and civil unrest. Some southern euro members may choose  to return to their former currencies -- or they may be asked to do so by other states.    An overarching structure for political control over the euro is now being erected. But it is likely to be resisted by Germany, the main paymaster, which rejects any idea that German strength is a root cause of recent disequilibrium.    Not for the first time in European history, differing perceptions of German power contain the seeds of much potential unrest. Monetary union was once the bright hope for laying to rest Germany's demonic ability to unhinge Europe. Now  it appears to be doing just the opposite.

491,1628428475.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  Europe's resentment of the American technology giant Google reached a new noise level on Thursday as the European Parliament passed a nonbinding vote to break up the company. Although merely symbolic -- the resolution carries no legal weight -- the move came the day after a separate European body sought to further expand citizens' ""right to be forgotten"" privacy protections against Google. Both moves are also playing out against the backdrop of a long-running investigation by the European authorities of Google, on which the European Union's new antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, is still getting up to speed. A breakup of Google in Europe will almost certainly not happen, legal experts say. And whether any of the various policy moves afoot will ever significantly curtail the company's business operations across the region is still too soon to gauge. But taken together, the level of policy-making activity being devoted to the company signifies the growing antipathy to American technological dominance in the European Union even as its citizens grow ever more reliant on its gadgetry and conveniences. Not since European officials spent years seeking to rein in the powers of an earlier tech titan, Microsoft, has an American company drawn such scrutiny on this side of the Atlantic. European fears of American technology giants have been stoked in the last 18 months by the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about American intelligence agencies' spying activities and perceived easy access to the world's tech infrastructure. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany publicly complained when it was discovered last year that her cellphone had most likely been tapped by American intelligence. In one sense, Thursday's vote amounts to little more than political posturing because the Parliament has no formal power over antitrust policy in the 28 countries of the European Union. That power rests with the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm. Yet the vote could raise pressure on Ms. Vestager to speed a decision on whether to bring formal antitrust charges against Google in an investigation that began in 2010. That inquiry involves Google's dominant position in Europe's Internet search business and asks whether the company's search results favor other Google-related services and hobble competing search advertising platforms. But even if Ms. Vestager finds fault on Google's part, analysts said, the most likely outcome might be changes in its business practices and even possibly a big fine -- as happened in past European investigations with Microsoft as well as another American tech giant, the chip maker Intel. ""Breaking up Google would be unprecedented in all kinds of ways and seems hugely unlikely in absence of massive, proven consumer harm -- and it's very unclear to me whether the commission is going to find that harm,"" said Mario Mariniello of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. He noted that United States antitrust officials had never found reason to censure Google, despite its market power on both sides of the Atlantic. He said it was ""hard to see how Europe could do this alone, and what would be the basis for doing something so fundamentally different from the U.S. authorities."" Ricardo Cardoso, spokesman for Ms. Vestager, said after the parliamentary vote that she would not be swayed by the result. Antitrust should be ""independent from politics"" so that Europe's ""procedures are not put into question,"" he said. A Google spokesman, Al Verney, declined to comment. The vote was taken on a broader resolution on the digital economy that passed with 384 votes in favor, 174 against and 56 abstentions. The lengthy resolution broadly called on the European authorities to break down barriers in digital commerce and was backed by significant numbers of lawmakers in the main conservative and socialist political blocs in the Parliament, the only directly elected body in the European Union. Ms. Vestager, a free-market Dane who took office on Nov. 1, succeeded Joaquín Almunia, who started the antitrust investigation of Google. Mr. Almunia tried three times to settle with the company but abandoned those efforts after its competitors and other groups said the proposed settlement terms would not be enough to allow for fair competition. Google's search engine, with about 90 percent of the market in some European Union countries, is even more dominant in Europe than it is in the United States. Ms. Vestager has said she would take the necessary time before deciding on the next steps in that antitrust case. She must also decide whether to open a formal investigation into Android, Google's mobile operating system. A preliminary inquiry, also begun under Mr. Almunia, has been considering whether Google uses Android to discriminate against non-Google applications. The power of the commission to break up companies was made explicit in 2003. In a landmark case in 2008, the German energy utility E.ON agreed to sell its extra-high-voltage network as part of a settlement, not something unilaterally imposed on the company. In the case of technology companies that have already run the antitrust gantlet in Europe, the main penalty has been the use of fines. The largest single fine yet levied in such a case was 1.1 billion euros, or $1.37 billion, in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market. But Microsoft underwent a series of investigations and settlements, racking up a total of more $3 billion in European fines over the course of a decade, including a penalty in 2013 for failing to adhere to an earlier settlement. For Google, its inability to reach a settlement with the European Commission despite years of trying means the company could still potentially face a fine of nearly $6 billion, or 10 percent of global annual sales, and restrictions on its freedom to do business in Europe if it is eventually found to have broken the bloc's competition laws. Among the proponents of tough antitrust action against Google in Europe are major American technology companies like Microsoft and Yelp, as well as powerful German and French publishing groups that have formed a lobbying group called the Open Internet Project. That Microsoft now finds itself lobbying against the current market giant indicates how quickly the dynamics can change in the digital economy. The breakup language was introduced by Andreas Schwab, a German member of the European Parliament. Mr. Schwab is ""of counsel"" at the German law and lobbying firm CMS Hasche Sigle, which has represented some of the German publishing interests that have been most eager to curb Google, including the German Magazine Publishers association. Mr. Schwab said he had not discussed the resolution with the law firm. In the United States, powerful members of Congress and Gov. Jerry Brown of California, where Google is based, strongly condemned the initiative. Leaders of congressional trade committees warned that the vote could even imperil negotiations over a trans-Atlantic trade pact, which the European Union has made a priority as part of its efforts to reinvigorate growth and create new jobs.

2873,1652617573.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  The latest conflict between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel erupted into public view on Monday, as the two leaders clashed from afar over Mr. Netanyahu's plans to visit Washington next month and the direction of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. At a White House news conference, Mr. Obama signaled his displeasure with the speech Mr. Netanyahu is scheduled to give in March to a joint meeting of Congress at the invitation of Speaker John A. Boehner, suggesting that his visit two weeks before the Israeli election risked injecting politics into the relationship between the United States and Israel.  ""It's important for us to maintain these protocols, because the U.S.-Israeli relationship is not about a particular party,"" Mr. Obama said, defending his decision to refuse to meet with the Israeli prime minister during the trip. ""The way to preserve that is to make sure that it doesn't get clouded with what could be perceived as partisan politics.""  But in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu vowed that he would go forward with the speech, despite increasing pressure in Israel and the United States to cancel or alter his plans to use it to appeal directly to American lawmakers for a harder line against Iran.  The dispute over politics and protocol dramatized a deepening rift between the American president and the Israeli prime minister over a potential nuclear deal with Tehran, with Mr. Obama arguing at his news conference for time to allow the diplomatic talks to bear fruit and Mr. Netanyahu warning of the emergence of a dangerous agreement that would threaten Israel. ""A bad deal with Iran is taking shape in Munich, one that will endanger the existence of Israel,"" Mr. Netanyahu said Monday at a Likud Party election event in Jerusalem. ""Therefore I am determined to travel to Washington and to present Israel's position before the members of Congress and the American people.""  Mr. Obama said that while he saw no reason to extend the Iran negotiations past a late-March target for a framework agreement, it was important that the talks be allowed to continue before further sanctions were imposed.  ""It does not make sense to sour the negotiations a month or two before they're about to be completed, and we should play that out,"" the president said during a joint news conference at the White House with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. If no deal can be reached, Mr. Obama said, he will work with Congress to apply ""even stronger"" sanctions. ""But what's the rush?"" he added. Beyond the substantive questions surrounding the nuclear talks, the politically charged dispute over the timing and scheduling of Mr. Netanyahu's visit persisted in both the United States and Israel. Asked about reports that he was ""outraged"" by Mr. Netanyahu's plans, the president, standing beside Ms. Merkel, made a pointed comparison: ""As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House -- and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one.""  The remarks made public what had previously been a behind-the-scenes battle between American and Israeli officials over Mr. Netanyahu's visit, orchestrated by his ambassador to the United States and Mr. Boehner, a Republican, without prior notification of the White House. A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu had no comment on Mr. Obama's remarks, which were broadcast after Mr. Netanyahu's on the most watched evening news broadcast on Israeli television. The spokesman, Mark Regev, also refused to comment on a Reuters report published earlier on Monday stating that discussions were underway in Israel about the possibility of changing the format of Mr. Netanyahu's planned speech because of the furor it had caused. Options included having Mr. Netanyahu speak to a closed-door meeting of Congress or making his speech at the annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington the same week, Reuters said, citing an unnamed source close to the prime minister's office. Mr. Netanyahu's remarks at the Likud event were broadly viewed as a denial of the report. Rebuffing sweeping criticism that his acceptance of the invitation had turned Israeli-American relations and the struggle to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran into a partisan debate, Mr. Netanyahu stated that this was ""an existential issue"" for Israel's security. In the midst of the heated Israeli election campaign, Mr. Netanyahu is facing growing domestic pressure to cancel his speech. While Israelis tend to admire a prime minister who now and again stands up to Washington, Israeli experts say, there is little appetite among the voters for a full-blown crisis in Israeli-American relations.  ""It seems the Israeli public more and more realizes that this was a mistake to begin with,"" said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert on national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. ""The whole adventure is not going to help Netanyahu in the elections, and it may harm him."" A poll cited on Israel's popular Army Radio on Monday indicated that nearly half of those asked believed that Mr. Netanyahu should cancel his speech. Only about a third said they were in favor of him going ahead as planned. ""Instead of acting responsibly as a prime minister should, Netanyahu insists on deepening the rift he has created with the Americans,"" the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper said in an editorial on Monday, calling on the prime minister to scrap the speech. ""He is thus endangering Israel's most important relationship, behaving rashly as far as strategy is concerned and trampling the remnants of Israeli diplomacy."" In the United States, a handful of congressional Democrats -- along with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who as president of the Senate would normally attend in a ceremonial role -- have said they plan to skip the speech.  But dozens more have privately implored Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador who helped arrange the speech, to prevail on Mr. Netanyahu to agree to a ""face-saving way to still come and speak"" without the trappings of a joint meeting, said a senior Democratic congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to detail the talks. American Jewish leaders, including Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, and Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, have warned that the speech could damage the essential relationship between the allies. The Democratic-leaning pro-Israel group J Street collected 20,000 signatures Monday on a petition calling for the cancellation of the speech, a spokeswoman said.

2109,1656545168.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  Ending an acrimonious standoff, European leaders hashed out a deal on Friday to extend Greece's bailout by four months, giving the troubled country a financial lifeline and avoiding a bankruptcy with potentially destabilizing consequences for the region. The agreement, reached at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers here, paves the way for Greece to unlock further aid from its bailout, worth 240 billion euros, or $273 billion. But the creditors will dole out the funds only if Greece meets certain conditions, setting the stage for tense negotiations that could unsettle the markets and create more political friction with Germany and other European countries. If Athens moves slowly, it might not get the money for months. Or the deal could fall apart altogether, again raising the prospect of a messy Greek departure from the euro currency.  ""As long as the program isn't successfully completed, there will be no payout,"" Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said after the negotiations.  As part of the deal, Greece will have to introduce a series of reforms required by creditors, like making labor laws more flexible and rooting out corruption. While Greece will have some potential leeway, the government must show that it is not abandoning austerity measures unilaterally. Greece, though, may still balk at the demands. The new left-leaning government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, swept to power last month on pledges to rebuff European-imposed austerity in Greece. He also promised to get a better deal from the country's creditors. ""You are asking a people to continue with a long, hard grind when they want to do something else,"" said Gabriel Sterne, an economist at Oxford Economics in London. The deal also does not address the fundamental problems with Greece's economy. Over the last five years, the economy has shrunk by a quarter. Unemployment stands at more than 25 percent. ""It's a short-term agreement to tide Greece over, but it doesn't even do that in the sense that Germany has said they won't release money until the Greeks legislate reforms,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, chief Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group based in London. ""It's not nearly enough to get Greece past the worst."" As a result, discussions may begin ""very soon"" on a possible third bailout for Greece, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, said at a news conference. Deciding what comes next was necessary because the program that was agreed to on Friday will expire in just four months. That is right before Greece must make two crucial bond payments worth 6.7 billion euros to the European Central Bank. While Mr. Tsipras will be able to propose rollbacks on austerity measures, the deal represents a steep climb down from his election pledges.  He and his outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have insisted that the painful spending cuts required by Greece's creditors to mend the nation's tattered finances, including minimum wage and pension cuts, must be removed to help reboot the economy. Mr. Tsipras had vowed to get rid of the current bailout program.  But Greece's creditors have insisted that Athens could not simply abandon previous accords to obtain crucial financing that the struggling country still needs. Despite Greece's resolve in recent weeks, the country's three main creditors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- will still largely continue to dictate the terms of the bailout. The fight between Athens and its creditors in recent weeks has highlighted a larger challenge. While Greece became the first country in Europe to elect a leader with a specific mandate to push back against German-led austerity, European officials and institutions made clear that they would not bow to any electorate. ""There is a basic clash between national democratic accountability and European rules and obligations,"" said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies. ""The European Union can't work if every new government can't keep the commitments of previous governments."" Asked at a news conference whether the eurozone's major powers ignored the wishes of the Greek electorate, Mr. Dijsselbloem said the collective needs of the region also needed to be taken in account. ""In the Eurogroup we have to work with 19 ministers who have 19 mandates,"" he said, and ""we have to reach a joint decision."" Decisions ""will always be about money and about conditions,"" he added. Still, both sides hailed the deal as a victory of sorts.  The Greeks are claiming that the agreement is symbolic of their new approach toward Europe, in which they are able to bargain for easier fiscal terms from Brussels and still have access to crucial funds. Mr. Varoufakis portrayed the accord as ""a way out for our country"" and a ""mutually beneficial arrangement"" for Greece and its creditors.  ""We averted the view that a country that is heavily indebted and in a program cannot possibly claim that elections can change something,"" he said.  European officials cast the pact as supportive of their view that money can only be dispensed if economic conditions are met. ""The Greeks certainly will have a difficult time to explain the deal to their voters,"" Mr. Schäuble said.  Some analysts, though, cautioned that the agreement only postponed difficult issues for another time. ""When is a deal not really a deal? When it kicks the can down the road and when no one can agree on what was agreed,"" said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the I.M.F. The next stage of negotiations could prove just as contentious as the talks in recent weeks. On Monday, Greece must send its creditors a list of all the policy measures it plans to take over the next four months. If the measures are acceptable, European finance ministers could sign off on an extension of the bailout agreement on Tuesday. At the same time, Greece is expected to start bargaining for a third bailout program, on top of the two it has already received, in hopes of securing a deal after the four-month funding runs out.  If Greece and its creditors do not come to terms, the situation will most likely raise further questions of whether Greece should even stay within the eurozone. On Friday, during a news briefing in Paris with President François Hollande of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany took pains to say that the eurozone countries were intent on keeping Greece in the currency bloc. Mr. Hollande was direct: ""Greece must stay in the eurozone,"" he said. But European leaders say this cannot come at any cost. Many have also acknowledged a growing sense that Europe could cope with a breakup with Greece, thanks to a host of firewalls that have been erected since 2012, the last time Greece faced an acute political crisis. ""This deal won't be a game-changer for the Greek economy -- the outlook there won't change dramatically"" because the funds will largely go to repaying Greece's debts, not to the real economy, said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. ""Any deal might not hold them over, and before very long we could find ourselves back in the same position in the not-too-distant future."" Should that happen, he added, there is a ""non-negligible risk"" that Greece could exit the eurozone, even if Mrs. Merkel and others have publicly stated they do not want that to happen. While the contagion effects would not be the same this time around, ""it would still be a seismic development.""

3559,1895144606.xml,"BERLIN -- Hungary indicted 11 people suspected of being smugglers on Thursday in the suffocation of 71 refugees, whose decomposing bodies were found stuffed inside a locked truck parked in neighboring Austria two summers ago at the height of Europe's migration crisis.The indictments of the suspects, including at least one Afghan, a Lebanese and several Bulgarians, were announced by Hungarian prosecutors. They also revealed for the first time that 67 other refugees had narrowly averted the same fate from the same smuggling ring, by kicking open the doors of their truck to escape.The discovery of the bodies in the truck, in the sweltering heat on Aug. 27, 2015, became a turning point in the European Union's disorganized response to the waves of migrants flooding into the Continent to escape war and deprivation in the Middle East and elsewhere.It was made just as European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, were gathered in the splendor of Vienna's Hofburg palace to discuss the mass migration. There was ashen-faced anguish at the news. Days later, Ms. Merkel reached her now-famous decision to admit refugees who had been refused passage from Hungary.On Thursday, 20 months after the police unlocked the truck found on the shoulder of the Budapest-Vienna highway, the first formal charges against those suspected of being the perpetrators were brought.The Afghan defendant, identified only as L. and said to be 30 years old, was described as the ringleader. Operating a people-smuggling ring from February to August 2015, he earned 300,000 euros, the prosecutors said in a statement summarizing their indictment.His two chief accomplices were identified by prosecutors as M., a 31-year-old Bulgarian who led a team of Bulgarian drivers, and K., a 51-year-old dual citizen of Bulgaria and Lebanon, who obtained vehicles and registration plates.The statement included details on how the refugees -- 59 men, eight women and four children from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Iran -- had died. One person, according to the Hungarian police last October, is yet to be identified.On the morning of Aug. 26, 2015, the statement said, ""members of the criminal organization"" locked the refugees into a truck near Morahalom, a town close to Hungary's border with Serbia, and a way station along the Balkan route that so many migrants followed that summer.""Approximately half an hour after the departure, the migrants indicated with bangs and cries that they were running out of oxygen,"" the statement said. ""The signals were heard by the driver,"" a 25-year-old Bulgarian identified only as l. and a ""forerunner,"" said to be a 38-year-old Bulgarian identified only as T., who apparently accompanied the truck in a separate vehicle.""Through their Bulgarian boss, they reported the problem to the Afghan head of the criminal organization who ordered them several times not to open the door,"" the statement added, ""to ignore the people suffocating there and to reach Western Europe as soon as possible.""""Even though they could have helped the victims, the driver and the forerunner complied with the instruction of their boss and the Afghan leader,"" the statement said. The 71 victims, it said, ""suffocated in horrendous conditions three hours from departure.""They died while the truck had still been in Hungary, it added.The two Bulgarians crossed into Austria and parked the truck on the side of the highway close to an outlet shopping mall in Parndorf, southeast of Vienna. They then returned to Hungary ""using the forerunner vehicle,"" the statement said.The Austrian police noticed and opened the truck the next day.Even as Europeans reeled in shock from the discovery, the smuggling of refugees went on uninterrupted. ""In order to make more money, the following morning the members of the criminal organization loaded 67 migrants into an unventilated, closed refrigerator lorry near Morahalom,"" the prosecutors said.""The defendants turned a blind eye to the fact that because of the inhuman conditions, migrants had got into life-threatening medical conditions, and transported them to the town of Gols, Austria. This time, the migrants could kick the door of the load area open, thus no one died.""The statement said nine of the suspects were in custody in the town of Kecskemet, southeast of Budapest on the main route to the Serbian border. The two others should be tried in absentia, it added.All 11 suspects are charged with human smuggling as part of a criminally organized group, and with ""the torture of the smuggled persons,"" the statement said. The four defendants most directly involved in the deaths face charges of homicide committed with particular cruelty, against more than one person, including people under the age of 14. Under Hungarian law, they face life imprisonment if convicted.The Bulgarian identified as M., and another unidentified Bulgarian, are charged with 67 counts of life-threatening battery in connection with the second truck from which the migrants escaped.The Hungarian news agency MTI said the trial would start in June, and would last at least into the fall. It reported that 284 witnesses were expected, but gave no details on nationality.ALISON SMALE   Follow Alison Smale on Twitter                           @asmalenyt                        .

3382,2191727173.xml,"The massacre of 49 people in New Zealand on Friday highlights the contagious ways in which extreme right ideology and violence have spread in the 21st century -- even to a country that had not experienced a mass shooting for more than two decades, and which is rarely associated with the extreme right.New Zealand may be thousands of miles from Europe or the United States, but videos of the killer show that he was deeply entrenched in the global far right, a man familiar with the iconography, in-jokes and shibboleths of different extremist groups from across Europe, Australia and North America, as well as a native of the extreme-right ecosystem online.A manifesto linked to the accused killer, released through his social media account on the morning of the massacre, suggests its author considered himself a disciple and comrade of white supremacist killers. The suspect, identified in court papers as Brenton Harrison Tarrant of Australia, also hailed President Trump, mocking his leadership skills but calling him ""a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.""Mr. Tarrant was charged on Saturday with murder in connection with the killings.The author was particularly influenced by the ideas and methods of Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist who murdered 77 people in 2011, and whose own rambling 1,518-page manifesto inspired several copycat extremists -- including, according to the authorities, Christopher Hasson, the Coast Guard lieutenant facing federal charges for planning a domestic terrorist attack patterned after Breivik.Indeed, the manifesto was a Who's Who of white supremacist killers. The author took inspiration from Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine African Americans in a church in South Carolina in 2015, as well as with Luca Traini, Anton Lundin Pettersson and Darren Osborne, all of whom carried out racist attacks in Europe in recent years.His clothes and weapons were also carefully curated. He wore a patch with an emblem used by numerous neo-Nazi groups across the world, including in Australia. Scrawled on his rifle was a white nationalist credo popularized by the American domestic terrorist and neo-Nazi David Lane. On his flak jacket was a symbol commonly used by the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian neo-Nazi paramilitary organization.And as he live-streamed a video from his car, he played a song devoted to Radovan Karadzic, a Bosnian Serb responsible for the deaths of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats during an ethnic war in the Balkans in the 1990s.The ubiquity of social media, as well as the accessibility of websites such as 4chan and 8chan where the extreme-right congregate online, allowed him to immerse himself easily in extremist conversation, said Matthew Feldman, director of the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right, a Britain-based research group.""People who read this stuff are just as likely to be in New Zealand, Norway or Canada as they are in America,"" Mr. Feldman said. ""The internet is borderless. Not only is it borderless, but places like 4chan were built for right-wing extremists. You have anonymity if you wish it, and these posts of incitement aren't going to be taken down immediately.""But if the manifesto highlights the spread of extremism throughout the deep recesses of the internet, it also shows how extremist discourse and tropes have seeped into mainstream politics and media.Mr. Trump, who condemned the attacks, has frequently made racist remarks, enacted policies against immigrants and Muslims, and courted white nationalists, whom he has said include ""some very fine people.""On Friday, Mr. Trump called the New Zealand killings a ""horrible disgraceful thing."" Asked by reporters if he saw white nationalism as a rising threat around the world, Mr. Trump said he did not.""I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If you look what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet.""The primary goal of the manifesto's author was to prevent Muslims and non-whites from taking over Western society, calling on white-majority countries to ""crush immigration,"" deport non-whites and have more children to stop the decline of white populations.""Remove the invaders,"" the manifesto read. ""Retake Europe.""These goals find echoes in the angry rhetoric of several mainstream politicians in Europe, including the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary.Mr. Orban has condemned the concept of a multiethnic society, repeatedly presented himself as a defender of Christian Europe against perceived Islamic invaders, and implemented policies that encourage Hungarian mothers to have more children.On Friday, just hours after the Christchurch shooting, Mr. Orban returned to these themes in a major speech in which he made no mention of the massacre in New Zealand.""Without Christian culture, there will be no freedom in Europe,"" he said. ""If we don't protect our Christian culture, we lose Europe.""Though its membership is currently under debate, Mr. Orban's party is part of a Europe-wide alliance of nominally center-right political parties, whose members include Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission.""The ideas expressed in this manifesto are pretty widely shared beyond the really fanatic fringe -- in not just the far-right but also the mainstream,"" said Tore Bjørgo, director of the Center for Research on Extremism at the University of Oslo. ""But there are very few"" -- outside the extreme fringes of the extreme-right -- ""who would take it one step further and try to start a race war.""The killer's ability to livestream the attack via his own social media channels -- which led to the dissemination of the video and manifesto across YouTube, Facebook and several mainstream media outlets -- also highlights how the far-right has harnessed the reach of major media and technology companies, even as it continues to spread its message through the dark corners of obscure internet sites.By broadcasting his atrocity himself, the killer was able to both circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of news coverage, while also encouraging those same gatekeepers to subsequently regurgitate some of his footage and even unwittingly amplify his ideas to millions more potential imitators than he might otherwise have reached.""It's clearly made for media coverage,"" Dr. Bjørgo said.And by writing most of the manifesto in a question-and-answer format, its author had clearly -- and correctly -- expected it to be picked up and distributed by mainstream media networks, amplifying his ideas further than ever.""One of the sickest and most upsetting parts of this for me is that the killings, the actual terrorist attacks, are forms of propaganda for the statements,"" said Mr. Feldman of the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right. ""They draw attentions to their statements through their actions.""That leaves media organizations in an ethical bind, Mr. Feldman said.""The coverage will be wall-to-wall today,"" he said, ""and tomorrow it will set someone else off.""Credit: PATRICK KINGSLEY; Ali Winston and Una Hajdari contributed reporting.The author of a manifesto linked to the accused killer took inspiration from the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.

504,2063149283.xml,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel, who staked her legacy on welcoming hundreds of thousands of migrants into Germany, agreed on Monday to build border camps for asylum seekers and to tighten the border with Austria in a political deal to save her government.It was a spectacular turnabout for a leader who has been seen as the standard-bearer of the liberal European order but who has come under intense pressure at home from the far right and from conservatives in her governing coalition over her migration policy.Although the move to appease the conservatives exposed her growing political weakness, Ms. Merkel will limp on as chancellor. For how long is unclear. The nationalism and anti-migrant sentiment that has challenged multilateralism elsewhere in Europe is taking root -- fast -- in mainstream German politics.Ms. Merkel agreed to the latest policy after an insurrection over migration policy led by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, threatened to bring down her coalition.Mr. Seehofer demanded that Germany block migrants at the border if they have no papers, or have already registered in another European country.Ms. Merkel, who supports free movement across Europe's borders, has been opposed to any moves effectively resurrecting border controls until Monday night, when she made the deal to stay in power.The new policy is subject to the approval of the Social Democrats, the third party in Ms. Merkel's coalition.It would establish camps, called ""transit centers,"" at points along the border. Newly arriving migrants would be screened in the centers, and any determined to have already applied for asylum elsewhere in the European Union would be turned back.Under Ms. Merkel, Germany has been a bulwark against the rise of the far right in Europe and the increasing turn against migrants. Even as neighboring countries turned away those fleeing war and strife in the Middle East, she has welcomed more than a million since 2015, and lobbied for a collective European solution.Comparing the migrant crisis to a challenge on the same scale as Germany's postwar reconstruction and reunification, she appealed to fellow Germans that they were up to the challenge.""We can manage,"" she said famously in 2015, inspiring many to donate food, clothes and their time to help.Since then the number of new migrants has dropped to a fraction of what it was three years ago. But the good will has been eroding as Germany has struggled to absorb those already in the country.An ascendant far right has relentlessly pushed the narrative that the migrant crisis is continuing and that crime is up.It is actually at a 25-year low but a series of high-profile assaults in Germany involving migrants, including the rape and killing of a 19-year-old German student and the terrorist attack on a Christmas market that killed 12 people, has helped to turn public sentiment.Anti-migrant feelings helped lead to the rise of a far-right political party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which has put Germany's more mainstream parties under pressure to change.Ms. Merkel has been unable to stem the changing tide, with cascading implications for politics in Germany and Europe.""Her political capital is depleted,"" said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund. ""We are well into the final chapter of the Merkel era.""""Under her continued leadership, Germany will be largely immobilized at home and in Europe,"" Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff added, a dramatic change for a country that has been Europe's political and economic anchor. ""But the promise of Merkel was stability, not immobility.""As the chancellor faces domestic challenges, she is also confronted by pressures from the Trump administration.Over the past month, President Trump wrote sharply worded letters to Ms. Merkel and the leaders of several other NATO allies, criticizing them for spending too little on their own defense.In his letter to Ms. Merkel, Mr. Trump said that Germany was to blame for other countries' failure to spend enough, ""because others see you as a role model.""German postwar politics has been built around stability and consensus. Ms. Merkel governed in that tradition and became closely associated with it. She is one of only three chancellors who have run the country since 1982. And she has fended off many political opponents during her 13 years as chancellor.When Ms. Merkel first took office in 2005, it was a different world. A year after 10 formerly Communist eastern European countries joined the European Union, the Continent was still rife with idealism. Ms. Merkel, a pastor's daughter and trained scientist who had grown up in Communist East Germany, was not only the first woman but the first easterner to lead her reunified country.She steered Germany through a period of power and prosperity even as economic and political fires broke out abroad. Once in a while she veered from her calm-bordering-on-boring protocol; there were even times when she made radical decisions.She announced the end of nuclear power production after the Fukushima reactor disaster in Japan. She was determined to keep Greece inside the eurozone, even at the cost of painful austerity policies.In last September's election, Ms. Merkel's conservatives recorded their worst postwar result. It took two tries, negotiations with six other parties, nearly six months and a lot of concessions to political rivals to form a government.In the vote, the AfD emerged as the third-strongest force in the German Parliament and the main opposition party.Its rise has helped shrink the support base of the once mighty Social Democrats, and opened a rift in Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, or C.D.U., between those who stand by the chancellor's liberal worldview and those who want her gone and yearn for a more traditional conservatism.Above all, the AfD's rise has sharply shifted the powerful and already very conservative state of Bavaria to the right. Mr. Seehofer's tough stand on migrants is seen in part as a bid to protect his party's right flank.Even now, diminished and fighting political rebellions, Ms. Merkel made it clear on Monday that she is determined to battle on for those values that for many years made her one of the most popular politicians at home and abroad. But she also tried to put the best face on her concession.""The security of our country begins on our borders,"" the chancellor told reporters after meeting for several hours with the leaders of her party and those of Mr. Seehofer's Bavarian conservatives.She described the measure as simultaneously a national action to secure Germany's borders, but in cooperation with the European Union partner countries that the refugees are coming from.But Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff saw it differently.""What looks like a power struggle surrounding Ms. Merkel, behind this is actually a conflict about the integrity of the European project,"" he said. ""The four freedoms of the E.U. can no longer be enforced. We can't agree on freedom of movement of refugees and immigrants; the whole system has ceased to function.""Credit: KATRIN BENNHOLD and MELISSA EDDY; Christopher F.

4009,1930675921.xml,"BERLIN -- In the latest episode in the diplomatic skirmish between Germany and Turkey, police in Spain, acting on a request from Turkish authorities, have arrested a Turkish-German writer on vacation in Spain.Although the writer, Dogan Akhanli, 60, was released from custody within 24 hours of his arrest on Saturday, he was ordered to remain in Spain pending a decision on Turkey's request for his extradition, which could take up to 40 days.The grounds for extradition were murky, and Germany's foreign ministry said on Monday that it did not expect the request to be honored. But the arrest of Mr. Akanhil, who has long had a stormy relationship with his native country and became a German citizen 16 years ago, triggered outrage in Berlin.Chancellor Angela Merkel called it ""unacceptable,"" adding, ""We cannot allow international organizations such as Interpol to be misused in this way.""Germans expressed outrage when Mr. Erdogan on Friday inserted himself into German's national elections, calling on all Germans of Turkish descent not to vote for Ms. Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union; its governing partner, the center-left Social Democratic Party; and the left-leaning Greens party when they go to the polls on Sept. 24.Mr. Akhanli was arrested the following day, but he was released after Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who was in Spain following the terror attack in Barcelona, intervened on the writer's behalf.In interviews with German media, Mr. Akhanli said he was in bed early Saturday morning when he responded to a knock on the door of his hotel room in Granada to find armed police officers standing there, ""expecting to find a terrorist.""""They didn't storm into the room, perhaps because I opened the door in my underwear and my wife was still lying in bed,"" Mr. Akhanli told the German public broadcaster ARD. The police asked for his identification, he said, then waited for him to get dressed, before handcuffing him and taking him to the police station.Although he said he was treated well by Spanish police, the experience left him shaken.""It is terrible because I thought that I was safe in Europe. I thought the Turkish arbitrariness and arrogance cannot reach Europe,"" Mr. Akhanli said. ""They simply abuse international law, whatever it is good for. It has nothing to do with the rule of law.""Mr. Akhanli has a long history of run-ins with successive Turkish governments. Once a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, he was detained in Turkey after the military coup of 1980. and sentenced to six years jail in 1985.He was released in 1988 but continued to suffer harassment. After Mr. Akhanli completed compulsory military service he left Turkey for Germany where he was granted political asylum in 1991.In 1999, he published a novel, ""Kiyamet Gunu Yargiclari"" (""Judges of Doomsday""), which was set during the Armenian genocide, the mass killing of ethnic Armenians by the Ottoman government in 1915. The genocide is still a taboo subject in Turkey.In 2001, Mr. Akhanli gave up his Turkish passport and became a German citizen.In 2010, he was arrested in Istanbul, where he had flown to visit his father, who was dying. The charges against him dated to a 1989 armed robbery case. Mr. Akhanli spent four months in jail until he could provide witnesses who proved that testimony from prosecution witnesses had been false. His father died without seeing him and he left Turkey again.Despite his acquittal in the armed robbery case, the Turkish Supreme Court issued a final verdict in the case and sentenced him to life imprisonment in 2013 . The verdict is final with no chance of appeal so if he were extradited to Turkey, Mr. Akhanli could go straight to prison.Speaking German at a news conference in Madrid on Monday, Mr. Akhanli said he hoped to be allowed to return to Germany, but admitted he could not suppress his fears. Still, he remained defiant, vowing that no matter what happened, ""They will never silence me.""Spain also arrested another Turkish-born writer, Hamza Yalcin, on Aug. 3. A citizen of Sweden for 33 years, Mr. Yalcin, too, was vacationing in Spain and was detained as he was preparing to board a flight at Barcelona's airport, El Prat. He remains in detention.It is not immediately clear if the writers' arrests resulted from fresh warrants issued by Turkey, or represent Spain's readiness to act on longstanding Interpol red notices.A red notice is technically not an Interpol arrest warrant but a request by an individual country. The system of red notices has been increasingly abused by some countries, in particular Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey, to try to reach critics and political opponents abroad, according to Sarah Clarke at PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.The European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, and its branch in Spain, the Platform for the Defense of Freedom of Information, have issued statements in support of Mr. Yalcin and urged the Spanish government not to comply with the extradition.Mr. Yalcin is a chief columnist with the socialist news website, Odak. He and an Odak colleague face charges of ""insulting the president"" and ""denigrating the military,"" stemming from an article published on the website, the statement said.Mr. Yalcin was arrested in 1979 by Turkey's military government because of his ties to a Marxist-Leninist group and received two life sentences for ""revolutionary activities.""Credit: MELISSA EDDY; Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Istanbul, Turkey.Dogan Akhanli, a German Citizen Who Was Arrested in Spain On Saturday at Turkey's Request, Arriving at His Lawyer's Office.

2199,818621099.xml,"      KABUL, Afghanistan -- Insurgents intensified pressure on Afghan security forces on Sunday, killing five Afghan Army training officers in a suicide attack in Kabul and attacking an army recruiting center in the northern city of Kunduz. At least four Afghan soldiers and four police officers were killed in the Kunduz assault in a firefight that lasted more than 12 hours, government officials said.    In the Kabul attack, two insurgents armed with AK-47s and grenades opened fire on a bus carrying the army trainers around 8:10 a.m. One of the attackers ran into the bus and blew himself up, killing five officers and wounding nine others, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.    The attack occurred on the main road between Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad. The road has been the site of many similar attacks on NATO vehicles and supply trucks on their way to nearby coalition and Afghan military bases, but the bombing broke pace with what had been a relatively calm year in the capital.    Afghan National Army units from the 201st  Corps sealed off the blast site after the attack and shot dead a second attacker in what witnesses said was a 45-minute firefight.    In Kunduz, a group of insurgents on motorcycles stormed the front gate of an Afghan National Army recruitment center in the heart of the city of Kunduz around 6 a.m. on Sunday, according to an army officer at the scene.    The attackers shot and killed the gate security guards and entered the main courtyard, where two of them blew themselves up, the officer said. A fierce firefight erupted with the remaining insurgents as about 200 American and Afghan Army forces cordoned off the area and pounded the compound with heavy machinegun fire. The gunfire finally stopped around 6:30 p.m. as government forces took control of the building, local officials said.    ""The operation ended just now,"" Gen. Abdul Rahman Aqtash, the deputy police chief of Kunduz Province, said moments after gunfire stopped. ""We took control of the building. We cleared the building. We found the bullet-riddled bodies of two suicide bombers inside the building."" Officials said at least four Afghan soldiers and four police officers had been killed in the fighting. There were no immediate reports on civilian casualties.    The Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks and promised a bloody year in 2011.    ""We will carry out more attacks in the future,"" a Taliban spokesman, Zabiulla Mjahid, said by telephone, adding that ""2011 will be a devastating year for both of us.""    President Hamid Karzai called the attacks a ""big and unforgivable crime.""    ""Those who are committing such attacks are the enemies of the people of Afghanistan who don't want our security forces to get strong,"" he said in a statement.    Just a day before the attacks, the Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany paid a surprise visit to Kunduz, where most of the German troops in Afghanistan are based. Germany has the third-largest contingent of forces in the country  after the United States and Britain. Because of the deteriorating situation, Mrs. Merkel was confined to barracks.    Her  visit came amid growing differences inside her coalition government over when to begin withdrawing the 4,700 German troops serving in the country. The police officers' deaths  in Kunduz added to what has been a succession of deadly years for the Afghan National Police. Last solar year, which began March 21, the police lost 1,265 officers, mostly to insurgent attacks, said Zemarai Bashary, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. The police are on pace for the same number of casualties this year, ministry figures show.    Gen. Josef Blotz, chief spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, called the high police casualty rate a clear ""testament that the Afghan forces do sacrifice a lot for their country.""    By comparison, about 282 Afghan soldiers were killed in 2009. Statistics for this year were not available on Sunday.    Coalition casualties also continued to rise on Sunday as two service members were killed by improvised explosive devices. No details on their nationalities were immediately released. A tally by the Web site icasualties.org before Sunday's deaths showed that NATO and American forces had lost 699 troops since January in what has been the deadliest year of the war.   The Kunduz attack comes amid a shift in violence in the country. In discussing the White House overview of United States strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan released last week, officials claimed progress in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban insurgency, but acknowledged flare-ups elsewhere in Afghanistan.

3141,2060754067.xml,"LAMPEDUSA, Italy -- On the beaches of Greece, thousands of migrants landed every day. In the ports of Italy, thousands landed every week. Across the borders of Germany, Austria and Hungary, hundreds of thousands passed every month.But that was in 2015.Three years after the peak of Europe's migration crisis, Greek beaches are comparatively calm. Since last August, the ports of Sicily have been fairly empty. And here on the remote island of Lampedusa -- the southernmost point of Italy and once the front line of the crisis -- the migrant detention center has been silent for long stretches. Visitors to the camp on Monday could hear only the sound of bird song.""It's the quietest it's been since 2011,"" said the island's mayor, Salvatore Martello. ""The number of arrivals has dramatically reduced.""It is the paradox of Europe's migration crisis: The actual number of arriving migrants is back to its pre-2015 level, even as the politics of migration continue to shake the Continent. On Thursday, leaders of the European Union are gathering in Brussels for a fraught meeting on migration that could hasten the political demise of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and unravel the bloc's efforts to form a coherent migration policy.The precipitous drop in migrant arrivals doesn't mean that Europe is without real challenges. Countries are still struggling to absorb the roughly 1.8 million sea arrivals since 2014. Public anxiety has risen in countries like Germany after high-profile assaults involving migrants, including the killing of a 19-year-old German student and the terrorist attack on a Christmas market that killed 12 people.And leaders still have sharp disagreements about who should take responsibility for the newcomers -- border states like Greece and Italy, where most migrants enter Europe; or wealthier countries like Germany, which many migrants subsequently attempt to reach.But what is striking is how many leaders, particularly in far-right parties, continue to successfully create the impression that Europe is a continent under siege from migrants, even as the numbers paint a very different picture.""We have failed to defend ourselves against the migrant invasion,"" Viktor Orban, the far-right prime minister of Hungary, said in a recent speech. He has made it a jailable offense for Hungarians to assist undocumented migrants.Nor is Mr. Orban alone in taking a hard line. Since the start of the month, Matteo Salvini, the Italian interior minister, has closed Italy's ports to charity-run rescue boats. Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister, has threatened to turn back refugees at his country's southern border. And across the Atlantic, President Trump has claimed, wrongly, that migration led to a crime epidemic in Germany.The tactics seem to have worked. Data released this month by the European Union showed that Europeans are more concerned about immigration than about any other social challenge. Mr. Salvini's party is now leading in Italian polls, up 10 percentage points since an election in March. Mr. Orban won re-election in April with an increased majority, after a campaign in which he focused almost exclusively on migration.Even on Lampedusa, Mr. Martello won the mayoralty last year by promising to focus more on local issues than on burnishing the island's international reputation as a place of sanctuary for migrants.But the reality on the ground is that, despite the rhetoric, migration is back to pre-crisis levels -- and has been for some time.More than 850,000 asylum seekers arrived in Greece in 2015, with most of them eventually making their way to northern European countries like Germany. So far this year, little more than 13,000 have made the same journey. More than 150,000 people arrived in Italy in 2015; the number so far this year is less than 17,000. In 2016, when applications were at their highest, more than 62,000 people sought asylum in Germany, on average, every month. This year, that average has fallen to little more than 15,000 -- the lowest since 2013.On Lampedusa, more than 21,000 migrants landed in 2015. So far this year, the figure is less than 1,100. Only in Spain have arrival numbers risen, from more than 16,000 in all of 2015 to just over 17,000 so far in 2018. But the increase is still comparatively small -- more people would arrive in a single week on the Greek island of Lesbos at the height of the crisis than are likely to arrive in Spain this year.""It's an invented crisis,"" said Matteo Villa, a migration specialist at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies. ""The high flows of the last years have bolstered nationalist parties, who are now creating a crisis of their own in order to score cheap political points.""Mr. Salvini and Mr. Orban have cultivated popular support by creating the impression that they are the only leaders willing to make the tough decisions needed to reduce migration. Yet the European establishment, under pressure from the likes of Mr. Orban and Mr. Salvini, has been quietly working for some time with the main gatekeepers along the migration trails to Europe, including with authoritarian regimes, to bring the numbers down.In Italy, arrival numbers plummeted after Mr. Salvini's predecessor controversially persuaded several militias to halt the smuggling industry in northern Libya, and to keep thousands of would-be migrants in dangerous conditions in makeshift Libyan detention centers.""The measures implemented by the previous government, which Salvini was so critical of, have actually been effective,"" said Andrew Geddes, director of the Migration Policy Center at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.At the same time, several European governments have made deportation agreements with Sudan, whose leader, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has been charged with war crimes charges. A deal with Niger has helped a crackdown on smuggling in the Western Sahara. And most controversially, the German and Dutch governments brokered a European Union deal in 2016 with the authoritarian government of Turkey that led to an immediate and drastic drop in migration to Greece.""The paradox is that, in this narrative that Merkel opened the E.U.'s borders, it was in fact Merkel, with the Dutch, who negotiated the most effective agreement on the borders of the E.U.,"" said Gerald Knaus, director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based research group that first proposed the deal, and that drafted early versions of it.Now Europe's challenge is largely about process: How to house asylum seekers waiting for decisions on their cases; how to integrate them into the economy and into society if their applications are approved; and how to deport them if not. These challenges remain as officials also have yet to fully address the squalid migrant camps of Greece, which house roughly half of the country's 60,000 asylum seekers, or the underground economy of Italy, where many of the country's 500,000 undocumented migrants are exploited.The European Union summit meeting that opens on Thursday is a reminder of how much the political landscape has shifted. Ms. Merkel, the German chancellor who was once the Continent's unassailable leader, now needs to secure an agreement with other European leaders to stave off a political crisis at home.Her rebellious Bavarian interior minister, Mr. Seehofer, has threatened to close Germany's border with Austria to asylum seekers who have already registered elsewhere in Europe, usually in Greece or Italy. Ms. Merkel wants to avoid this, as it would most likely set off a domino effect of stricter border controls across the Continent. That would obstruct the movement not just of refugees but also of European Union citizens, endangering one of the bloc's core values: free movement between member states.Mr. Seehofer has agreed to wait while Ms. Merkel tries to negotiate at the summit meeting an improved asylum system for the European Union, but this seems a distant prospect, as no one can agree what that system should look like. Some leaders, like Mr. Orban in Hungary, say that Europe should simply protect its borders without worrying about the complexities of its asylum system.""If we defend our borders, the debate on the distribution of migrants becomes meaningless, as they won't be able to enter,"" he said in a speech this month.Others, like Ms. Merkel, want to reduce migration but acknowledge it cannot be ended entirely unless Europe abandons the right to asylum that was enshrined in the international conventions that emerged in the aftermath of World War II.To uphold this right while also curbing migration, officials in Brussels want to set up offshore hubs to process asylum applications in Africa, while some analysts argue it would be easier and cheaper to invest in more efficient asylum systems in Greece and Italy -- and to secure more deportation agreements with the countries migrants are originally from.Meanwhile, anti-immigrant leaders, if capitalizing on the migration issue, are hardly unified. Italy wants to scrap the Dublin regulations, which stipulate that asylum seekers must stay in the European Union country in which they first register, and distribute migrants throughout the bloc. But hard-liners like Mr. Orban, Mr. Seehofer and Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz of Austria refuse to share Italy and Greece's burden.""Their proposals are fundamentally contradictory,"" Mr. Knaus said. ""Salvini and the Italians want to get rid of Dublin and share everyone throughout Europe. The Bavarians want to push everyone back to Austria. And Kurz says that's fine -- we'll then send them to Italy and Hungary.""And far away on Lampedusa, this makes the debate seem less about the specifics of migration management, and more about the widening chasm between liberal and illiberal forces in Europe.It is ""an ideological war,"" said Mr. Martello, the mayor. ""Europe is divided into two main blocs: One is defending the borders, and the other is actually doing something about the situation.""Follow Patrick Kingsley on Twitter:                                           @                            patrickkingsley                        .A Budapest train station that was crowded by migrants in 2015, left, is quieter now.

4212,1722344044.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  Eager to push the migration crisis back beyond their own frontiers, European leaders agreed late Thursday to strengthen border controls and endorsed a deal with Turkey aimed at stopping the flow of Syrians and others before they can reach Europe. Gathered in Brussels for their fourth consecutive summit meeting focused on the issue of migrants, leaders agreed to strengthen an existing but largely powerless European border agency, Frontex, and to commit officers from their own national border services to help front-line states like Greece. ""Protection of our external borders is the main priority today,"" said Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body that convenes summit meetings, adding that help from Turkey was crucial to this goal. The meeting, which stretched late into the night, signaled a shift from the message of open-armed welcome conveyed over the summer by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany toward what critics describe as a ""fortress Europe"" approach. A shooting late Thursday involving Bulgarian border guards and migrants added to growing pressure on leaders to put an end to what Ms. Merkel on Thursday described as the ""very disorderly"" flow of people seeking shelter from war and persecution or simply a better life. The Bulgarian media said an Afghan man had been killed after entering the country from Turkey.  Before flying to Brussels, Ms. Merkel told the lower house of Parliament in Berlin that Europe faced a ""historic task"" in dealing with the influx of migrants and must work with Turkey, where more than two million Syrians have taken shelter, to slow the flow toward Europe. ""Without a doubt Turkey plays a key role in this situation,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""Most war refugees who come to Europe travel via Turkey. We won't be able to order and stem the refugee movement without working together with Turkey."" The meeting began shortly after officials from Turkey and the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, reached a preliminary agreement during overnight talks in Ankara, the Turkish capital, that seeks to slow the migration to Europe. The deal, Mr. Tusk said, is ""devoted to our goal of stemming migration flows via Turkey to the E.U."" He declined to say how much money Turkey would receive in return, saying only that the agreement was based on the principle of ""You help us and we help you. It is that simple."" Germany and the European Union as a whole are hoping that Turkey will curb migrant traffic to the Greek islands, some just a few miles from the Turkish coast, and also take back asylum seekers whose claims for refugee status in the European Union are rejected. As an inducement, leaders pledged to increase ""substantially"" European financing for Turkey and also to speed up visa-free access to Europe for Turkish citizens -- a politically delicate issue at a time when most governments are scrambling for ways to limit, not expand, access to their countries. The French president, François Hollande, voicing widespread concern about a possible influx of Turks, told reporters early Friday that visa liberalization ""should not lead to people coming from Turkey without us knowing their identity for sure."" He said he had ""insisted"" that Europe could relax its visa rules for Turkey only ""on a very specific and monitored basis."" Asked about the amount of aid to go to Turkey, which had been asking for billions of euros, Mr. Hollande said no figure had yet been agreed upon. But he added that any money should be used chiefly to improve the lives of refugees in Turkey and to finance the establishment of receiving centers for them. Turkey, relishing the leverage that Europe's desperation has given it, has driven a hard bargain, with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu telling Turkish television that his county would not take back migrants rejected for asylum in Europe unless Turks were allowed to travel to Europe without visas. Under political pressure at home to curb an influx of asylum seekers to Germany, which now expects 1.5 million migrants in all this year, Ms. Merkel has increasingly looked to Turkey as a possible solution and is to travel there on Sunday to appeal for help from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. That will follow a visit to Turkey on Wednesday and Thursday by Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister, who has been also been pushing for a deal with Ankara on the migration issue. Diplomats in Brussels say that one proposal under discussion would call for Turkey to set up camps funded and supervised by the European Union where asylum seekers hoping for refuge in Europe would be registered and processed. This revives an idea put forward more than a decade ago by Tony Blair, when he was the British prime minister, for the establishment of migrant reception centers in Africa and the Middle East that would effectively move offshore the processing of asylum claims. The plan, which Amnesty International condemned as ""inherently unlawful,"" never got off the ground. But as European governments grope for ways to deal with the current crisis, keeping asylum seekers outside Europe would also solve what has become a major headache: what to do with the tens of thousands of people in Europe whose asylum claims have been rejected but who refuse to leave. In the second quarter of this year, according to Frontex, the European Union border agency, only 43,000 of the 72,168 failed asylum candidates left as ordered. European Union interior ministers last week agreed on tougher measures to ensure the swift deportation of migrants who do not qualify for refugee status, including the ""use of detention as a legitimate measure of last resort."" Germany's Parliament on Thursday toughened its own policy toward failed asylum-seekers as part of a package of measures that could help Ms. Merkel tamp down protests in her own conservative camp that Germany's considerable resources are being overextended by the crisis. The package means that Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro will now be considered ""safe,"" and almost none of their citizens therefore eligible for asylum in Germany. Other measures will cut cash benefits paid to asylum claimants, reduce the amount of time to process claims and speed deportation of those who do not get permission to stay. ""I have looked very carefully at the figures,"" Ms. Merkel said, ""and Germany is nowhere near the top"" in sending home those refused asylum. Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a research group in Brussels, said the renewed emphasis on tougher border controls was in part ""just political theater,"" because leaders find it ""much easier to agree on the need for strong borders"" than on what to do with refugees once they arrive. ""There is a need to demonstrate action, so there is a lot of talk without the details being worked through,"" she said. Hungary, which faced strong criticism over the summer for using force to prevent asylum seekers from breaching a fence along its southern border, is now moving swiftly to enhance its own border security. In a letter to European Union leaders this week inviting them to the summit meeting, Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, warned that Europe faced even ""bigger waves"" of asylum seekers once winter passes, and he called for tighter controls.  In an effort to bolster Europe's defenses, leaders agreed to expand the financing and authority of Frontex, which currently has no guards, vehicles, boats or aircraft of its own. Last week, the agency appealed to European Union member states to provide 775 border guards to help ensure that all asylum seekers are properly identified and registered. Only 48, however, have so far been offered. Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today's Headlines: European Morning newsletter.

3950,1080581049.xml,"       ATHENS -- After a period of relative calm, European markets shuddered once again on Wednesday as protests erupted across Greece and demonstrators surrounded the Spanish Parliament for a second day to protest the austerity program of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.  Earlier this month, the European Central Bank announced its intention to buy unlimited quantities of debt from European nations, including the troubled economies of southern Europe. That kept the peace in the financial markets until Wednesday, when political instability startled investors, with the Spanish stock market dropping 3.9 percent and even the German DAX falling by 2 percent. The interest rate on the 10-year Spanish bond, which had been declining, inched closer to the ominous 6 percent level. On Tuesday in Spain, tens of thousands of demonstrators besieged Parliament to protest austerity measures planned by Mr. Rajoy. Last week, more than half a million people marched in cities across Portugal to protest an increase in social security contributions, and a million marched in Barcelona calling for Catalan independence. In Athens, trade unions called a nationwide strike Wednesday to contest billions of dollars in new salary and pension cuts being discussed by the government and its international creditors. It was the first such walkout since a conservative coalition led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras came to power in June.  Mr. Samaras is negotiating a $15 billion austerity package that is needed to persuade Greece's so-called troika of lenders -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission -- to release nearly $40.7 billion in financial aid that the country needs to stay solvent. Mr. Rajoy has been trying for months to convince investors that Spain can handle its own problems and that it will not need a bailout that would force Madrid to cede some authority over its fiscal affairs to its lenders, and is set to introduce new cutbacks to meet budgetary goals. Those will include restrictions on early retirement and various measures to streamline regulations and fight unemployment, he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The proposed cuts in Greece have ignited new anger, with many talking openly of increased impoverishment as the nation grapples with a third round of austerity measures in three years. The protests in Athens were peaceful in the morning, as civil servants, teachers, medical personnel, bank employees and lawyers made their way to the city center. A police spokeswoman put the turnout at 35,000 to 40,000 people -- modest by Greek standards. But violence broke out shortly after 1 p.m., as a group of protesters wearing black masks hurled gasoline bombs at police officers on Vasilissis Sofias, a wide avenue abutting Parliament, sending bursts of flame and black smoke into the air. Firebombs were also thrown at the Finance Ministry and into the lush National Gardens next to Parliament.  Officers wielding batons responded with bursts of tear gas, scattering demonstrators and tourists as police helicopters circled overhead and flares exploded. Many cursed the police with cries of ""traitors"" and ""Merkel's pigs"" -- a reference to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the country widely blamed for insisting on strong austerity measures in exchange for aid.  Mr. Samaras is scheduled to meet on Thursday with his coalition partners -- Evangelos Venizelos, the Socialist leader, and Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left -- to seek a common line regarding the $15 billion austerity plan. Representatives of the troika left Athens last week after tussling with the government over the depth of cuts planned for salaries and pensions. The two sides need to reach an agreement before the lenders can issue a report in October grading Greece's ability to mend its tattered finances. Additional aid depends on a positive assessment, and is critical to lifting confidence that Greece will remain in the euro zone. But for many Greeks who took to the streets, that pact amounts to a bargain with the devil. Anna Afanti, 50, a secondary school teacher, removed a surgical mask she had been wearing to ward off the tear gas to denounce Greece's foreign creditors. ""They just want to impoverish us, to bring our salaries down to the level in India and swoop in and buy everything on the cheap,"" she said, referring to planned privatizations of state assets. Ms. Afanti, who traveled about 40 miles to Athens from the town of Halkida with several colleagues to attend Wednesday's protest, said her salary had been cut by a third since the crisis hit. ""I should have left this country a long time ago,"" Ms. Afanti said. ""Now I'm stuck here."" Smaragda Aivalioti, 21, an economics student at Athens University, had planned to stay in Greece despite the crisis. ""But now I just don't see any hope,"" she said. ""All the odds are stacked against Greece. Even if we stay in the euro, life will be wretched. What's the point?"" Speaking to state television, Alexis Tsipras, the head of the leftist opposition party Syriza, which opposed Greece's bailout terms, said the country's only hope was in Greeks' rejecting austerity.  Numerous government services across the country were shuttered for the day, and main transportation arteries in central Athens were disrupted. Flights to and from the main Athens airport were delayed as air traffic controllers briefly took part in the strike.

1360,433446869.xml,"      The governing commission of the European Union on Wednesday issued its strongest warning yet to Turkey to open its ports to Cyprus and make more progress on human rights or face a possible suspension of talks over allowing the country to join the organization. Speaking after the release of a report highly critical of Turkey's efforts to make changes requested by the European Union, Olli Rehn, the union's expansion commissioner, delivered what appeared to be an ultimatum to Turkey: soften the intransigence over Cyprus or risk the collapse of the European Union bid.  ''Failure to implement obligations will affect the overall progress of negotiations,'' Mr. Rehn warned. ''This is likely to be the last opportunity to make real, serious progress for some years to come on the issue of Cyprus.'' Turkey has refused to meet an end-of-year deadline set by the European Union to open its ports and airports to the Greek-speaking part of Cyprus, which belongs to the organization. Turkey insists it will not compromise on Cyprus unless the European Union lifts a trade embargo against the northern Turkish side of Cyprus. The report, which also highlighted shortcomings on issues like minority rights and freedom of speech, did not call for an immediate halt in the talks with Turkey. But European Union officials said the harsh tone of the report made it increasingly likely that a summit meeting of European Union leaders in mid-December would at least consider a partial suspension of the negotiations. ''The pace has slowed during the past year and significant further efforts are needed,'' the report said. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sought to play down the criticism. ''For us, the E.U. process maintains its importance,'' he said. ''Our aim is to achieve the maximum possible. Our struggle will continue.'' A poll published here on Tuesday by the International Strategic Research Organization showed that two-thirds of Turks would rather suspend membership talks with the European Union than give ground over Cyprus. ''If the E.U. fulfills its promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus, then we will open our ports,'' said Egemen Bagis, a senior adviser to Mr. Erdogan and a member of the governing Justice and Development Party. ''If European leaders want reforms to continue in Turkey, if they want their safety to be assured in an unstable region, if they want to assure an alternative energy supply, then they should show us some encouragement,'' he said. In the cafes, mosques and streets of Istanbul, the overwhelming feeling was indifference. ''Here we go again, yet another report from the E.U. criticizing us,'' said Gurol Yilmaz, 24, a waiter at a cafe in the bustling Taksim neighborhood. ''Most Turks don't really care. The E.U. will never accept a Muslim country.'' Membership talks between Turkey, with 70 million people, and the European Union cannot continue apace if Turkey fails to meet its obligations toward the organization by the end of the year, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, warned Wednesday. ''Otherwise, the E.U. will have to draw the appropriate consequences,'' she said. ''A simple 'Let's keep on going as before' will not be possible.'' The report also rebuked Turkey for its failure to meet minimum standards on human rights and cited concerns over the rights of women, Kurds and religious minorities.

FILE -- Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor of Austria and chairman of the conservative People’s Party, at his office in Vienna, July 5, 2018. Kurz was young, adept at social media and unafraid to borrow from populists, but in his downfall, some see “the collapse of a new narrative” for European conservatives. (Gordon Welters/The New York Times)


BERLIN — When Sebastian Kurz first became chancellor of Austria the whole of Europe sat up. Only 31, he had turned around the fortunes of his ailing conservative party and almost overnight become a role model for struggling center-right leaders elsewhere on the Continent.
Four years later, Kurz has been forced to resign amid a criminal investigation into allegations that he used public money to manipulate opinion polls and that he paid off a tabloid newspaper for favorable coverage.
His downfall is unique to Austria but it could reverberate far across Europe.
It comes at a time when Europe’s political landscape looks ever more fragmented and the once-mighty traditional parties of the center-left and center-right have lost ground to a host of new political actors, not least on the extremes.
Youthful and media-savvy, Kurz styled himself as someone who had a formula for how to preserve a capacious center amid the disruption. He adopted the anti-immigrant language of an ascendant far right and refashioned his traditionally staid People’s Party into a political movement that attracted hundreds of thousands of new supporters.
“Why don’t we have someone like that?” lamented the German tabloid Bild in October 2017.
But the recent allegations against him and a trove of evidence that has already been released suggest that the very communication strategy that won him conservative votes at home and admiration in conservative circles abroad was at best “deeply immoral” and at worst illegal, said Thomas Hofer, a longtime observer of European politics and an independent political consultant in Vienna.
“What we’re seeing in Austria is the collapse of a new narrative for conservative parties in Europe,” said Hofer. “Internationally, the Kurz model was something others looked at very closely as a possible answer to far-right populists.”
All around Europe, ailing traditional center-right parties have struggled to reinvent themselves, at times flirting with the temptation to tack further to the right.
In neighboring Germany, the Christian Democrats of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who have governed the country 52 of the last 72 years — including the last 16 — lost spectacularly in last month’s election. It was their worst election result ever.
In France, where five of the eight presidents since the inception of the Fifth Republic in 1958 have been conservatives, the traditional center-right has not won any national elections since 2007.
And in Italy, Christian Democrats co-governed for nearly half a century after World War II, but over the past two decades the political right has increasingly radicalized and fragmented.
One of the few successful center-right leaders left in Western Europe is Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Britain — and he, much like Kurz, co-opted not just the nationalist anti-immigrant rhetoric of populists but also their aggressively symbiotic relationship with tabloids.
Some analysts say that recent events in Austria suggest that Kurz’s political strategy is not a viable long-term strategy to revive centrist conservatism.
“Kurz is someone who has taken a traditional center-right party, dragged it into populist mode and is now in big trouble,” said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at Oxford University.
One lesson, Garton Ash said, is that the decline of traditional catchall parties on both the right and the left is structural — and probably irreversible.
“The big parties of the center-right and center-left which dominated in Western Europe after 1945 are not what they were and unlikely ever again to be what they were,” he said.
Across Europe, elections have revealed a more fragmented society, one that increasingly defies traditional political labeling.
For much of the postwar era, European countries tended to have a large center-left party and a large center-right party. The center-left parties championed a working-class organized in powerful labor unions, while the center-right gathered up a broad array of middle- and upper-class voters, from conservative churchgoers to free-market business owners. It was not unusual for one camp to get 40% of the vote.
Social Democratic parties lost that status a while ago. With union membership declining and parts of the traditional working-class constituency abandoning the center-left, its share of the vote has shrunk since the early 2000s.
If the crisis of social democracy has been a familiar theme over the past decade, the crisis of conservatism is now on full display. Still, even if the conservative parties of old have shrunk, many of their policies remain dominant in Europe, analysts point out.
“If you look at Germany, France or Italy, it’s not classic center-right conservatives that won elections or are in power, but the policies in place are traditionally center-right,” said Dominique Moïsi, a political scientist and senior adviser at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron blew up the French party system by winning elections with his En Marche movement, but the pro-European market liberal once considered center-left has recently tacked sharply right.
Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, has no party affiliation, but as a former president of the European Central Bank is seen as a centrist.
Even in Germany, where a Social Democrat narrowly won the recent election, the party’s candidate for chancellor, Olaf Scholz, served as Merkel’s finance minister and is in some ways more associated with her outgoing government than with his own party.
“The clear-cut division of left and right that dominated European politics has been blurred and no longer truly applies,” Moïsi said. “The extreme right is far more extreme. The center-right is moving even more so to the center, and the classical left has either completely imploded like in France or is fighting for survival with the Greens. And so you have a political landscape that is much more fragmented than it used to be.”
That has not stopped some leading politicians from looking for ways to resurrect the past — and looking to Kurz as a model.
“You can see in Austria that Sebastian Kurz manages as a young conservative politician to be No. 1 with young people,” Tilman Kuban, leader of the youth wing of Germany’s conservatives, said days after his party’s devastating election defeat.

Christoph Ploss, head of the Christian Democrats in Hamburg, also pointed to Austria as a “good example” of how to revive conservatism. “Over there,” he said, “the partner party came back up with a clear direction.”
Both men declined to comment when asked last week whether the allegations against Kurz had changed their views.

What exactly Kurz’s resignation means is hard to say. He resigned as chancellor Saturday after his coalition partners, the Greens, said they could not continue governing with him in light of the current allegations, and threatened a vote of no confidence. But he remains party leader and a lawmaker in Parliament.
Some predict that even after his anointed successor and loyal ally, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, is sworn in as chancellor Monday, Kurz will still hold the reins and may even stage a comeback at some point.

It would not be the first time he reinvented himself.
Once a conservative youth leader, who distributed branded condoms as a campaign gag and eventually earned a reputation as a liberal integration minister, Kurz veered sharply to the right, winning elections and entering into a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party.
After his first government imploded two years ago, he won reelection and increased his party’s share of the vote even more. He then went into an unlikely coalition with the far smaller Green Party.
In many ways, Kurz is less representative of traditional conservatism and more typical of the political opportunism associated with a new strain of right-wing politics that has evolved in Europe in the space between the center-right of old and a crop of noisy far-right parties on the extreme.
“The new right-wing politics which is about immigration and identity — that right-wing politics you see right across Europe,” said Garton Ash.
The temptation to move right is unlikely to vanish entirely, even after the scandals engulfing Austria, he said.
“Arguably the most dangerous populists are the ones who look least like populists,” Garton Ash said. “That is true of Johnson, and that was true of Kurz.”

1925,1035451744.xml,"       BERLIN -- The top leaders of Germany and Italy plan to meet Wednesday as part of an intense round of shuttle diplomacy before several critical decisions that face Europe. The region's leaders are struggling to appease voters questioning the price of unity in the euro currency union after three years of financial turmoil. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will host Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy, a week after the French and Greek leaders visited her here. In a last-minute change, Mr. Monti was to stop in Brussels late Tuesday to have coffee with José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Union. They planned to discuss the region's economic situation and the next steps for carrying out decisions made at a meeting of European leaders in late June. Mr. Monti is fighting mightily on two fronts. He is trying to stimulate Italy's stagnant economy from within. And he is working to nudge his European partners to let the European Central Bank buy more bonds from Italy and Spain to help keep their borrowing costs at sustainable levels. Ms. Merkel is seeking to steer the overall debate about Europe toward closer unity. In recent weeks, she has firmly favored keeping Greece in the euro zone despite opposition from within her political ranks. She has also made clear that she envisions a deeper political union and more far-reaching moves for fiscal and financial integration in Europe. ""Clearly we are seeing an effort to try to reshape the discussion, move it away from bailouts and try to open it up to what is the basic democratic system,"" said Ulrike Guérot of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""She is trying to say that Europe has a price, Europe has a value. This price is not solely financial, and you need to make this calculation."" Mr. Monti is a good audience for Ms. Merkel on the idea of a more federalized Europe, because Italy's government is set up similarly to Germany's, with individual regions sharing power with a federal government, Ms. Guérot said. Ms. Merkel could seek Mr. Monti's backing for more European integration in exchange for the promise of more financial support for Italy. Italy has a rising national debt, now at 123 percent of gross domestic product, and the prospects of a contracting economy through 2013, a combination that could prove fatal. The nation canceled a bond auction this month for what news reports described as fear that it would yield unsustainably high rates. On Tuesday, though, Italy sold five-year Treasury bonds at a 3.69 percent rate, down from 5.2 percent at the previous similar auction. Ten-year bonds went for 4.39 percent. That was down from 5.96 percent but still far higher than the 1.42 percent that Germany paid on similar securities in its last auction. A larger auction of Italian bonds is set for Thursday. Although Germany has remained the economic engine for Europe throughout the crisis, recent indicators have shown that even its economy is beginning to sputter. Demand for exports has fallen, and a recent survey showed that German manufacturers were worried about how the crisis would end.  Two former members of Ms. Merkel's government are at odds. Jörg Asmussen, a member of the European Central Bank's executive board, says the bank should embark on a significant bond-buying program to spur economic growth. Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany's central bank and a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, opposes such a move.  Although Ms. Merkel has not publicly taken a position, the issue may arise in her talks with Mr. Monti.  With the unemployment rate in Italy at 10.8 percent over all, and almost 35 percent among young people, the clock is ticking faster for Mr. Monti, who has already raised the retirement age and taxes and is under pressure to find more spending cuts without tearing Italy's already fraying social fabric. Gasoline in some parts of Italy has hit 1.90 euros a liter, or more than $9 a gallon. After a cabinet meeting on Friday, the Italian government said it would focus on reducing debt and selling assets as part of a plan to improve competition, reduce energy costs and encourage start-up companies. Adding to the pressures, the government's mandate is expected to end next spring, when Italian national elections are scheduled, and the climate is becoming more politicized.  The two main parties backing the government, the center-left Democratic Party and center-right People of Liberty, are struggling to keep pace with a new social and economic reality that includes the rise of populist, anti-euro sentiment. This month, Mr. Monti angered many Germans when, in an interview with the newsmagazine Der Spiegel, he called for governments to be given more independence from their parliaments to resolve the crisis. Efforts by Ms. Merkel to move swiftly, and independently of lawmakers, have resulted in legislation ending up in Germany's Constitutional Court. That court is to rule on Sept. 12 on a challenge to the legality of German participation in the European Stability Mechanism, and the fiscal pact for Europe. It is not expected to strike down either measure. But it could impose conditions that would make the process of German ratification even more cumbersome than it is, with the chancellor requiring parliamentary approval for each bailout. Such struggles have contributed to Ms. Merkel's push to create a stronger European political union and shift fiscal decision making from the individual countries to a Pan-European body, giving the European Central Bank a stronger oversight role.

2642,433236817.xml,"      It was a sad enough measure of how badly the Bush administration has damaged its moral standing that the secretary of state had to deny that the president condones torture before she could visit some of the most reliable American allies in Europe. It was even worse that she had a hard time sounding credible when she did it. Of course, it would have helped if Condoleezza Rice was actually in a position to convince the world that the United States has not, does not and will not torture prisoners. But there's just too much evidence that this has happened at the hands of American interrogators or their proxies in other countries. Vice President Dick Cheney is still lobbying to legalize torture at the C.I.A.'s secret prisons, and to block a law that would reimpose on military prisons the decades-old standard of decent treatment that President Bush scrapped after 9/11. Pesky facts keep getting in the way of Ms. Rice's message. Yesterday, the new German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that Ms. Rice had acknowledged privately that the United States should not have abducted a German citizen, Khaled el-Masri, who says he was sent to Afghanistan and mistreated for five months before the Americans realized that they had the wrong man and let him go. Ms. Rice's aides denied she'd made that admission. Mr. Masri tried to appear at a press conference in Washington yesterday to discuss a lawsuit filed in Virginia on his behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union, a suit alleging wrongful imprisonment and torture -- but the United States government has refused to allow him into the country. At issue is the practice of extraordinary rendition. When a government captures someone really dangerous, like a terrorist leader, who cannot be charged under that government's laws, it sends him to another country where the authorities are willing to charge the suspect or at least can get away with locking him up indefinitely without charges. It's been going on for decades, infrequently and selectively, but the United States is reported to have stepped it up since 9/11 and violated international law by sending suspects to places where it knows they will be tortured. Recently, European governments expressed outrage at reports that some detainees were held at secret C.I.A. prisons in Europe. Ms. Rice, like other American officials, will not comment on these reports. But before leaving Washington on Monday, she read a statement implying that if there were any secret prisons out there, the host countries knew about them. She rather bluntly warned that European countries who want American intelligence had better not betray any secrets. Certainly, some of Europe's shock at the news of the C.I.A. camps is political theater aimed at the widely anti-American European public. But that doesn't make it any less disturbing that the United States government seems to have lost its ability to distinguish between acts that may occur sub rosa in some exceptional, critical situations and the basic rules of proper international behavior. Ms. Rice said Monday that rendition had been used to lock up some really dangerous bad guys, like Carlos the Jackal and Ramzi Yousef, who masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. But both men were charged in courts, put on trial, convicted and sentenced. That's what most Americans think when they hear talk about ''bringing the terrorists to justice'' -- not predawn abductions, blindfolded prisoners on plane rides and years of torture in distant lands without any public reckoning.

2030,2491490863.xml,"All three leaders seemed to recognize, though, that their first virtual encounter was a moment to celebrate the end of the ""America First"" era.President Biden used his first public encounter with America's European allies to describe a new struggle between the West and the forces of autocracy, declaring that ""America is back"" while acknowledging that the past four years had taken a toll on its power and influence.His message stressing the importance of reinvigorating alliances and recommitting to defending Europe was predictably well received at a session of the Munich Security Conference that Mr. Biden addressed from the White House.But there was also pushback, notably from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who in his address made an impassioned defense of his concept of ""strategic autonomy"" from the United States, making the case that Europe can no longer be overly dependent on the United States as it focuses more of its attention on Asia, especially China.And even Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is leaving office within the year, tempered her praise for Mr. Biden's decision to cancel plans for a withdrawal of 12,000 American troops from the country with a warning that ""our interests will not always converge."" It appeared to be a reference to Germany's ambivalence about confronting China -- a major market for its automobiles and other high-end German products -- and to the continuing battle with the United States over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia.But all three leaders seemed to recognize that their first virtual encounter was a moment to celebrate the end of the era of ""America First,"" and for Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel to welcome back Mr. Biden, a politician whom they knew well from his years as a senator and vice president.And Mr. Biden used the moment to warn about the need for a common strategy in pushing back at an internet-fueled narrative, promoted by both Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China, that the chaos surrounding the American election was another sign of democratic weakness and decline.""We must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people in this changed world,"" Mr. Biden said, adding, ""We have to prove that our model isn't a relic of history.""For the president, a regular visitor to the conference even as a private citizen after serving as vice president, the address was something of a homecoming. Given the pandemic, the Munich conference was crunched down to a video meeting of several hours. An earlier, brief closed meeting of the Group of 7 allies in which Mr. Biden also participated, hosted this year by Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, was also done by video.The next in-person summit meeting is still planned for Britain this summer, pandemic permitting.Mr. Biden never named his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, in his remarks, but framed them around wiping out the traces of Trumpism in the United States' approach to the world. He celebrated its return to the Paris climate agreement, which took effect just before the meeting, and a new initiative, announced Thursday night, to join Britain, France and Germany in engaging Iran diplomatically in an effort to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement that Mr. Trump exited.But rather than detail an agenda, Mr. Biden tried to recall the first principles that led to the Atlantic alliance and the creation of NATO in 1949, near the beginning of the Cold War.""Democracy doesn't happen by accident,"" the president said. ""We have to defend it. Strengthen it. Renew it.""In a deliberate contrast to Mr. Trump, who talked about withdrawing from NATO and famously declined on several occasions to acknowledge the United States' responsibilities under Article V of the alliance's charter to come to the aid of members under attack, Mr. Biden cast the United States as ready to assume its responsibilities as the linchpin of the alliance.""We will keep the faith"" with the obligation, he said, adding that ""an attack on one is an attack on all.""But he also pressed Europe to think about challenges in a new way -- different from the Cold War, even if the two biggest geostrategic adversaries seem familiar.""We must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China,"" he said, naming ""cyberspace, artificial intelligence and biotechnology"" as the new territory for competition. And he argued for pushing back against Russia -- he called Mr. Putin by his last name, with no title attached -- mentioning in particular the need to respond to the SolarWinds attack that was aimed at federal and corporate computer networks.""Addressing Russian recklessness and hacking into computer networks in the United States and across Europe and the world has become critical to protect collective security,"" Mr. Biden said.The president avoided delving in to the difficult question of how to make Russia pay a price without escalating the confrontation. A senior White House cyberofficial told reporters this week that the scope and depth of the Russian intrusion was still under study, and officials are clearly struggling to come up with options to fulfill Mr. Biden's commitment to make Mr. Putin pay a price for the attack.But it was the dynamic with Mr. Macron, who has made a habit of criticizing the NATO alliance as nearing ""brain death"" and no longer ""pertinent"" since the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, that captured attention.Mr. Macron wants NATO to act as more of a political body, a place where European members have equivalent status to the United States and are less subject to the American tendency to dominate decision making.A Europe better able to defend itself, and more autonomous, would make NATO ""even stronger than before,"" Mr. Macron insisted. He said Europe should be ""much more in charge of its own security,"" increasing its commitments to spending on defense to ""rebalance"" the trans-Atlantic relationship.That is not a widely shared view among the many European states that do not want to spend the money required, and the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are unwilling to trust their security to anyone but the United States.Mr. Macron also urged that the renovation of NATO'S security abilities should involve ""a dialogue with Russia."" NATO has always claimed that it is open to better relations with Moscow, but that Russia is not interested, especially as long as international sanctions remain after its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine about seven years ago.But Mr. Macron, speaking in English to answer a question, also argued that Europe could not count on the United States as much as it had in past decades. ""We must take more of the burden of our own protection,"" he said.In practice, it will take many years for Europe to build up a defense arm that would make it more self-reliant. But Mr. Macron is determined to start now, just as he is determined to increase the European Union's technological capacities so that it can become less dependent on American and Chinese supply chains.Mr. Biden, in contrast, wants to deepen those supply chains -- of both hardware and software -- among like-minded Western allies in an effort to lessen Chinese influence. He is preparing to propose a new joint project for European and American technology companies in areas like semiconductors and the kinds of software that Russia exploited in the SolarWinds hacking.It was Ms. Merkel who dwelled on the complexities of dealing with China, given its dual role as competitor and necessary partner for the West.""In recent years, China has gained global clout, and as trans-Atlantic partners and democracies, we must do something to counter this,"" Ms. Merkel said.""Russia continually entangles European Union members in hybrid conflicts,"" she said. ""Consequently, it is important that we come up with a trans-Atlantic agenda toward Russia that makes cooperative offers on the one hand, but on the other very clearly names the differences.""While Mr. Biden announced he would make good on an American promise to donate $4 billion to the campaign to expedite the manufacturing and distribution of coronavirus vaccines around the world -- a move approved last year by a Democratic-led House and a Republican led-Senate -- there were clear differences in approach during the meeting.Underscoring the importance that the European Union accords to Africa, Mr. Macron called on Western nations to supply 13 million vaccine doses to African governments ""as soon as possible"" to protect health workers.He warned that if the alliance failed to do this, ""our African friends will be pressured by their populations, and rightly so, to buy doses from the Chinese, the Russians or directly from laboratories.""Vaccine donations would reflect ""a common will to advance and share the same values,"" Mr. Macron said. Otherwise, ""the power of the West, of Europeans and Americans, will be only a concept, and not a reality.""Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, on Friday also urged countries and drugmakers to help speed up the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines across the globe, warning that the world could be ""back at Square 1"" if some countries went ahead with their vaccination campaigns and left others behind.""Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it's also the smartest to do,"" Dr. Tedros said to the Munich conference. He argued that the longer it would take to vaccinate populations in every country, the longer the pandemic would remain out of control.Melissa Eddy, Elian Peltier and Mark Landler contributed reporting.Melissa Eddy, Elian Peltier and Mark Landler contributed reporting.President Biden on Friday.

260,1934603212.xml,"ANNABERG-BUCHHOLZ, Germany -- Taking the stage, Chancellor Angela Merkel thanked the thousands of Germans who had turned out at a recent campaign rally, and then leveled her gaze at a small but noisy knot of right-wing protesters yelling and blowing whistles at the back of the square.""Some want to listen, but others can only shout,"" the chancellor scolded, singling out the protesters from the far-right Alternative for Germany party. ""That is what separates us; some want to get things done, others just yell.""With that, Ms. Merkel defused what could have been an ugly challenge at her rally in Annaberg-Buchholz, near the eastern border. As Ms. Merkel seeks a fourth term in elections on Sept. 24, she has done much the same to what had once seemed like a potent threat from the far right in general.Barely six months ago, after more than 11 years in power, the chancellor was vulnerable. Her immigration policies were unpopular and had buoyed a far right that was surging across Europe. Ms. Merkel herself appeared ambivalent about another run as polls showed voters tiring of her.No longer. Today, the chancellor's center-right Christian Democratic Union draws as much as 40 percent support, enough to lead a new coalition. Ms. Merkel's position is so secure, many political observers have already shifted their focus from who will win the election to whom she will choose to form her next government.Ms. Merkel, 63, faces off on Sunday in her first debate against her main challenger, Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic party. He, too, had once seemed a threat, but has watched Ms. Merkel open a long lead.It was the advance of the far right, however, that seemed most unnerving for the chancellor and her country. Its ebbing has much to do with the German allergy to extremism since the country's experience with fascism, as well as with the debilitating internal squabbles of the fledgling Alternative for Germany.But its relative cratering also reflects Ms. Merkel's skills as a political tactician and an often cold-eyed, nonideological policy pragmatist, even as she has sometimes been cast as a liberal idealist.Not least, she has maneuvered to deflate the issue that had left her most vulnerable -- her decision to open German borders to nearly a million asylum seekers in 2015 -- and in the process stripped away her far-right opponents' animating force.While the Alternative for Germany appears poised to enter Parliament for the first time -- a potentially historic breakthrough for the far right -- the movement has found itself struggling to reach double-digits in the polls. It regularly stages colorful protests at Ms. Merkel's rallies, but runs the risk of making itself a political gadfly rather than the kingmaker it had hoped to be.""Ever since Ms. Merkel has shifted her policies and allowed fewer refugees into Germany, that issue is no longer helping the Alternative for Germany,"" said Oskar Niedermayer, a professor of political science at the Free University of Berlin. ""And they are doing everything to damage their own reputation.""From the start of the migration crisis, while many Germans panicked at the arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, she confidently counseled: ""We will manage this."" How she managed it was through a series of course corrections.In spring 2016, Ms. Merkel negotiated a European Union deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey that effectively stanched the refugee flow. Only about 280,000 people arrived in Germany last year, compared with 890,000 in 2015.The deal drew criticism for betraying the democratic values on which Ms. Merkel had argued Germany had to accept the refugees in the first place. But Ms. Merkel has since been able to argue that Germany, more than most European countries, has done its share.In her annual summer news conference in Berlin, Ms. Merkel defended her decision, calling it ""important and right."" But she also shifted blame to European partners, who have resisted or refused to take in refugees. ""It is also right that we must find long-term, sustainable structures,"" she said.Drastically cutting the flow of newcomers has allowed Ms. Merkel to shift focus to the work of integrating the asylum seekers already in the country. But she has also put the onus on them to learn German, while taking a harder line on expelling those found to pose a danger or rejected for asylum.In the past two years, the authorities have regained a grip on who has entered the country, and most refugees have begun language classes, although only 9 percent have found jobs, according to the Federal Employment Agency.Even the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 that were blamed on migrants, the attack on Berlin's Christmas market last year and a string of lesser attacks have done little to dent Ms. Merkel's standing now that elections are approaching.Ms. Merkel has appealed to Germans' pragmatism, pointing out that given the number of migrants who came into the country, some were bound to be criminals.In Germany's widely decentralized system, she was also able to point to security deficiencies at the local level. She went on to pledge more police, improved technology and, if necessary, legal changes, to ensure safety.If anything, many Germans have seemed to gravitate around her as a reassuring presence and steady hand in an uncertain time.""She has done a wonderful job,"" said Marcel Naumann, 21, who works in a chemical factory in Saxony and said he would vote for the chancellor. ""She got us out of the crisis and even with her refugee policies, she has remained true to her vision.""But the Alternative for Germany is by no means a spent force, and it is trying hard to move the immigration issue to the fore again.In recent weeks, the party has introduced a provocative advertising campaign, playing on the perceived threat posed by immigrants and assisted by Harris Media, which is based in Texas and run by Vincent Harris, who briefly served on President Trump's campaign.One ad shows a pregnant white woman with the tagline: ""New Germans? We'll make them ourselves."" Another says, ""Burkas? We prefer bikinis,"" and shows two women dressed accordingly.The party's immigration platform focuses on overhauling the country's asylum laws and using the money Berlin currently spends on processing and integrating refugees to keep them in camps closer to their home countries.""German interests must be guiding principles and not that whoever happens to be visiting here right now gets some sort of development program,"" Alexander Gauland, the party's leader, recently told reporters.He later riffed on Mr. Trump's own campaign promise, saying: ""It's not always 'America First.' Sometimes it's 'Germany First.""'Yet Mr. Trump's brand of populism is not popular in Germany. Germans have taken the angry divisions in the United States since his election as a caution, watching warily and condemning demonstrations by emboldened far-right extremist groups, including neo-Nazis.Given their history, Germans have shown little tolerance when the Alternative for Germany has overstepped social and historical boundaries, like when one regional leader, Björn Höcke, questioned the tradition of remembrance and atonement for the country's Nazi crimes.This week, Mr. Gauland suggested Ms. Merkel's integration minister should be ""disposed of"" back in her parents' homeland, Turkey. The chancellor condemned Mr. Gauland's statement as ""racist,"" and such remarks have turned off many would-be backers.""Many people do vote for the Alternative for Germany, not because they agree with their positions, but out of protest against the other parties,"" noted Hendrik Träger, a political scientist with the University of Leipzig.In the tumultuous aftermath of the refugee crisis, protest was what many Germans wanted, and last year the Alternative for Germany made record gains in five state elections.But after a year in which Ms. Merkel has tamped down many of Germany's anxieties, the appeal of a protest vote seems to be waning, he and other analysts noted.In three regional elections this year -- all of them in the west, where voters are less volatile --  the chancellor's party came out on top, including in the country's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, considered by many to be a bellwether.Carola Lange, who attended Ms. Merkel's rally in Annaberg-Buchholz, acknowledged that her city of 22,000 has struggled with changing demographics. She now works helping support the roughly 300 refugees who have arrived over the past three years.The political tensions make her uneasy, and she views politics with increasing skepticism, she said. Nevertheless, she said, the chancellor would get her vote.""The only alternative for Germany,"" Ms. Lange said, ""is Ms. Merkel.""Credit: MELISSA EDDY; Edmund Heaphy contributed reporting.Supporters of Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Recent Campaign Rally of Her Center-Right Christian Democratic Union, at Annaberg-Buchholz.

912,1679008160.xml,"       PARIS --  For two years after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, Europe was awash in talk about American excesses in mass surveillance, objecting to how the National Security Agency swept up emails and phone conversations -- even of political leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- in an American electronic net that seemed to envelop the Continent. But the past few months have helped clarify what much of Europe really objected to: the American involvement in that surveillance, not the net itself. Worried about Islamic extremists in its midst, Britain passed even more sweeping surveillance laws last summer. And in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris in January, the French have begun what has become almost a rite of passage for Western nations since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, voting through the lower house of Parliament on Tuesday vastly expanded government powers to protect, and spy on, its own citizens. Even Ms. Merkel, who lectured President Obama in 2013 about her family's life under the East German Stasi, found herself reminding reporters the other day that Germany often has to spy to protect its citizens -- while dancing around the question of how much it may have cooperated with the N.S.A. in looking at Airbus Industries. In Europe, the impulse for government protection, even at the expense of civil liberties, is hardly new. Britain's surveillance cameras on every major city block are well known. France has conducted similarly intensive surveillance for years, but without explicit legal authorization. ""The French government is saying, in essence, 'We do it anyway, so we might as well be able to use it for evidence in court,' "" said Frédérick Douzet, a cybersecurity expert and professor at the University of Paris 8. However, some of the measures authorized in the pending legislation would be new -- at least as far as anyone knows -- including the use of new technology to conduct analysis of bulk metadata, experts said. The reality, however, is that it is unlikely that any of the proposed measures would have prevented the January attacks at Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, some experts in Paris said. And while counterterrorism was the justification as the National Assembly greatly enhanced the spying powers of the nation's intelligence services, Ms. Douzet and others point out that the law allows broad surveillance in other areas as well. But there was a near absence of public attention and debate around the measures -- or around whether France needs the kinds of checks and balances on surveillance that the United States has imposed. Indeed, the news barely made the front pages of newspapers here on Wednesday, even though in the run-up to the vote, some news outlets had extensively highlighted the potential abuses of the far-reaching legislation. ""This is the tradition of a country that used to see itself as a great power -- so we do whatever it takes,"" said Dominique Moïsi, the co-founder of the French Institute for International Relations and a political scientist. At the same time, Congress is inching in the other direction. By the end of June, the American government may get out of the business of bulk collection of telephone metadata, though under legislation and a proposal by President Obama, that collection would simply move to telecommunications companies.  In fact, after more than a decade of massive government surveillance, the extent of which was not fully known until the leaks from Mr. Snowden, the N.S.A. now finds itself having to justify its programs to the White House and the American people.  But the outrage in Europe about the Snowden disclosures was largely centered on the intrusion of the American surveillance system onto European soil -- sometimes with the help, witting or unwitting, of American companies. ""The common vocabulary among the Europeans is that Europe is privacy friendly, and the United States tolerates a Stasi-like N.S.A. and vicious data collectors like Google and Facebook,"" said Benjamin Wittes, the co-author of ""The Future of Violence."" ""It's nonsense. They object to the American part."" The exception may be Germany, where the current uproar is about what the B.N.D., Germany's intelligence service, may have done in partnership with the United States. But when it comes to social media, European sensibilities are beginning to change. Even those countries that prize discretion are facing the reality that there is a new era of global communication that compromises privacy, and that little on the Internet can be kept secret. That, perhaps, is making it easier for citizens to accept government snooping. In France, opposition to the bill gained little traction even though critics argued that the proposed legislation would allow French intelligence services to collect and monitor bulk communications, read text messages and email, and tap cellphones with little judicial oversight. The opponents included many Internet companies, civil liberties supporters and some left-leaning members of the French Parliament, as well as some judges and lawyers. But they won little political support: Western Europe lacks the strand of antigovernment sentiment seen in libertarians or the Tea Party in the United States. And while there is some legislative branch oversight, it rarely delves deeply into government proposals and programs. So just as the Sept. 11 attacks led President George W. Bush and Congress to grant far-reaching powers to American intelligence agencies, deadly attacks in France and elsewhere in Europe and fear about the thousands of extremists in Syria and Iraq with European passports are allowing intelligence and security services to obtain powers that previously eluded them. France, with the largest Muslim population in Europe, has seen more of its citizens go to fight in the Middle East than any other European country. Similarly, the hundreds of British citizens who went to Syria in recent years prompted the government last summer to approve surveillance measures forcing telecommunication companies to retain data for a year. (In the United States, the norm is even longer.) Now, human rights and civil liberties advocates say their worry is not only how France might use the new law, but also how other countries will seize on the precedent. ""My fear is that France is setting an example here, and it encourages a race for the bottom on a global level,"" said Cynthia Wong, a lawyer and senior Internet researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""If France does it, why wouldn't every other government do the same thing?"" Even so, some analysts and opponents of the new measures said they would not necessarily have prevented Chérif and Saïd Kouachi from massacring 12 people at Charlie Hebdo. Nor would the added measures probably have headed off Amedy Coulibaly from taking hostages days later at a kosher grocery store, killing four of them as well as a police officer, they said. ""The Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly were already targeted by the intelligence services,"" said Pierre-Olivier Sur, the head of the Paris bar association, who opposes the new measures. The authorities, others note, already have more information and suspects than they can track with current resources and funding, neither of which are augmented by the proposed legislation. ""The law would not have added anything,"" Mr. Sur said. Credit: ALISSA J. RUBIN and DAVID E. SANGER; Alissa J. Rubin reported from Paris, and David E. Sanger from Washington.  ",2015-05-07

153,2185771431.xml,"FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Bank managers used to boast that theirs was one of the few global investment banks to survive the financial crisis without a government bailout.That was before the scandals, the multibillion-dollar fines and the plummeting stock price. Now, a decade after the global meltdown, it looks like Berlin may intervene after all.The market chatter is that the government will strong-arm Deutsche Bank into a merger with its Frankfurt crosstown rival Commerzbank, which also has major problems. The two banks are Germany's largest, and the government's likely aim is to ensure the country has at least one big-league lender.Neither the banks nor officials in Berlin are commenting on persistent reports in a wide variety of German publications, including the Handelsblatt newspaper and Manager magazine, but a government manifesto in February effectively endorsed the idea. Germany needs a bank that can ""stand up to competitors from the United States and China,"" the document said.Analysts and investors warn that the sum of two ailing Frankfurt banks is not necessarily one healthy bank. But a merger may be the least-bad option for Deutsche Bank, which lost money in the fourth quarter of 2018 and faces accusations that it facilitated money laundering.Would a merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank make any sense? Here's a look at some of the main issues.Why are German banks in such bad shape?The underlying problem is that the German banking market is overcrowded, and consumer and small-business lending is dominated by quasi-public savings banks. That makes it hard for commercial lenders like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank to make money, even though they reside in one of the world's most formidable economies.But the two banks are also suffering the consequences of years of management mistakes.Commerzbank lent heavily to the shipping industry just before it ran into a deep recession caused by a worldwide oversupply of freighters. The bank required a government bailout in 2009 after it acquired Dresdner Bank, which turned out to have billions of euros in toxic assets. The government still owns about 15 percent of Commerzbank shares.Deutsche Bank, in its zeal to compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, got caught in many of the big scandals of the early 2000s: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions. It paid billions of dollars in fines.The bank's reputation continues to suffer. In November, German prosecutors and police officers raided Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether some bank employees helped criminals launder money in offshore tax havens.The bank's own inquiry uncovered no wrongdoing by employees, Karl von Rohr, the bank's chief administrative officer, said in February. Still, he acknowledged that the allegations drove away customers and hurt the bottom line. Accusations of money laundering ""were not helpful in the fourth quarter of 2018,"" Mr. von Rohr said at a news conference.Deutsche Bank reported a net loss of 409 million euros for the quarter, or $464 million. Commerzbank did better, reporting a profit of €113 million on revenue of €2.1 billion. Investors, however, remain skeptical. Shares of both banks are trading near 10-year lows.What's the point of combining two weak banks?German and European political leaders fear domination by the big American investment banks, which emerged from the financial crisis more powerful than ever. In times of economic stress, the argument goes, Germany will need a big bank with an international presence to ensure that German corporations still have access to credit.But political leaders risk creating a monster that could ultimately prove costly for taxpayers, said Sascha Steffen, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. In a crisis, the government would have little choice but to bail out the country's biggest bank.""They would become even more 'too big to fail,""' Mr. Steffen said. ""This is not a good idea.""Mr. Steffen said the government would be better off encouraging German companies to reduce their dependency on bank loans by issuing bonds, a common practice in the United States.Why is the government getting involved?By orchestrating a merger, Mr. Steffen said, Olaf Scholz, the German finance minister, may hope to raise the fortunes of his Social Democratic party, whose poll numbers have gone in the same direction as Deutsche Bank shares. Mr. Scholz has been a frequent visitor to Frankfurt recently, fueling media speculation that he is trying to act as marriage broker.Government meddling in the economy went out of fashion in the 1990s. But it's making a comeback as political parties try to regain electoral clout and beat back populist challengers by positioning themselves as defenders of jobs and creators of national champions. Even Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats are talking about ""industrial policy,"" a term that implies government involvement in company decisions.How hard would it be to combine the two banks?The history of German bank mergers is not encouraging. Commerzbank took years to absorb Dresdner Bank. Deutsche Bank continues to wrestle with its acquisition in 2010 of a majority in Postbank, which has a large branch network in Germany.""We see from Deutsche Bank and Postbank how long it takes to integrate information technology,"" said Jörg Rocholl, president of ESMT Berlin, a business school. ""This is a major burden.""Both banks have large, overlapping branch networks, which would have to be trimmed. That would not be easy. Job cuts are costly in Germany because of labor laws, and the union that represents bank workers has already signaled its opposition to a merger.There are a few areas where the banks complement each other. Commerzbank is strong in lending to midsize German exporters. Deutsche Bank is more international and could help those companies handle foreign financial transactions.But the large amount of duplication would inevitably lead to turf battles. ""I don't see an economic rationale for such a merger,"" Mr. Rocholl said.Why not a merger with a foreign bank?It might make sense for Deutsche Bank to team up with a strong foreign bank, but there don't seem to be any takers.Deutsche Bank is valued by the stock market at about €16 billion, half what it was worth at the end of 2017. That's very cheap for a big bank. JPMorgan Chase generates more revenue than that in a single quarter. The lack of takeover bids suggests that potential buyers think fixing Deutsche Bank would be more trouble than it's worth, Mr. Rocholl said. It's also possible that foreign banks are discouraged from bidding because they know the government would put up obstacles.Can the banks make it on their own?There have been signs of progress. Commerzbank's fourth-quarter profit was a 50 percent improvement over the same period a year earlier. The bank has largely disposed of its shipping portfolio and the bad assets it acquired from Dresdner Bank.Though Deutsche Bank reported a loss for the fourth quarter, it reported a net profit for the full year, its first since 2014. Under Christian Sewing, a risk expert who became chief executive in April 2018, Deutsche Bank exceeded self-imposed targets for cutting its costs, which are too high for the amount of revenue the bank generates.""They have shown the cost discipline they promised,"" Mr. Rocholl said. ""It would be too early to give up hope.""But it would probably take years for Deutsche Bank to regain its former stature.What would a new bank be called?No word on that. Deutsche Bank might signal a new, scandal-free beginning by agreeing to a name change, something like ""DeutscheCommerz.""But the Deutsche Bank brand, though tarnished, still connotes more than a century of tradition and has cachet. Commerzbank is just as old and just as proud; both banks were founded in 1870. Figuring out what to name the new beast, if it comes into existence, could be one of the toughest points of negotiation.The Frankfurt towers of Deutsche Bank, which lost $464 million last quarter.

1374,433593179.xml,"      Four weeks before leaders of the world's big industrial nations are to gather at a Baltic Sea resort in northern Germany, the police conducted sweeping raids on Wednesday on the offices and homes of left-wing campaigners whom they suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting. The raids, in which 900 police officers searched 40 sites in half a dozen cities, amounted to a show of force against potentially violent protesters at the meeting of the Group of 8. Like other countries that have been the host in recent years for this gathering, Germany is nervous about a repetition of the riots in Genoa, Italy, in 2001, when the police killed a demonstrator. Federal prosecutors said they were investigating 18 people suspected of belonging to a group that they said was planning fire-bombings and other attacks to disrupt the meeting in Heiligendamm, an expensive, out-of-the-way resort on a stretch of coast in the former East Germany. Prosecutors did not announce any arrests, but they said the people on their list were suspected of carrying out fire-bombings and other, less severe attacks in Hamburg and Berlin in the last two years. The Interior Ministry said it would tighten controls at border crossings to stop troublemakers from entering Germany -- a tactic it used successfully last summer during the World Cup soccer tournament. Normally, Germany's borders with its European Union neighbors are wide open. ''We want to distinguish between those who come to demonstrate peacefully and those who plan violence,'' said Christian Sachs, a ministry spokesman. He characterized the security precautions as the most extensive for one event in Germany since World War II. Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to welcome the leaders of Britain, Canada, Italy, France, Japan, Russia and the United States to the three-day meeting on June 6. She is setting an agenda that includes topics as varied as climate change and Africa. But terrorism is also likely to be on the minds of the leaders. At the last Group of 8 meeting in Western Europe, held in Gleneagles, Scotland, in July 2005, the leaders had barely settled in when news came of deadly bombings on the London transit system. Germany has been on edge about new terrorist threats since last month, when the Interior Ministry said it had learned that a radical Islamic group was plotting to strike an American installation here. The United States tightened security at its embassy in Berlin and other diplomatic buildings. ''That threat was absolutely serious,'' said Rolf Tophoven, a German counterterrorism expert. Mr. Sachs said there was no evidence linking that threat to the Group of 8 meeting. The authorities say they are more worried about radical antiglobalization groups, which have used the Internet to mobilize tens of thousands of protesters at previous Group of 8 meetings, even those held in similarly remote locations. German authorities are leaving little to chance. They have constructed a 7.5-mile, $17 million fence that will cut off access to Heiligendamm. Local residents have complained bitterly about the concrete-and-barbed-wire barrier, which some have likened to a new Berlin Wall. Nine naval ships will patrol the waters off the resort, while 16,000 local police officers and 1,100 soldiers will guard the perimeter, keeping protesters several miles from the meeting. Protest organizers said the security measures eclipsed those for President Bush's visit last July to the same part of Germany. Monty Schadel, a local organizer of the demonstrations, said antiglobalization forces in Germany had been subjected to intense surveillance by the police in recent weeks. ''Whenever three or four people get together for a meeting, the police are watching,'' he said. The organizers have told the police to expect 100,000 demonstrators in Rostock and other towns near the meeting. Mr. Schadel said the actual turnout could range from 50,000 to 150,000 people. Germany has had relatively little trouble with radical leftist groups since the 1970s and 1980s, when the Red Army Faction, also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, carried out more than 30 assassinations. But as the meeting draws closer, tensions are rising. Protesters recently splashed paint on a hotel in Heiligendamm. In December, a car belonging to a senior Finance Ministry official was set on fire.

2761,433197833.xml,"      At long last, two months after one of the strangest elections in Germany's modern history, Parliament seems certain on Tuesday to elect Angela Merkel, the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, as chancellor, the first woman to hold the position. Mrs. Merkel will immediately take power, name a cabinet and actually start governing, after weeks of intense negotiations over a program to pursue a ''grand coalition'' with her chief rivals, the Social Democrats of the departing Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.  It is not only that Mrs. Merkel is a woman, or even that she will be the first chancellor from the former East Germany, that promises to make Tuesday a moment to remember in this country's history. In what now seems a swift and unexpected change, Mrs. Merkel's arrival in power signals a shift to a new political generation, one that did not go through the usual rites of passage to power in Germany. By an almost eerie coincidence, the Social Democratic Party last week elected a new leader, Matthias Platzeck, who is also an easterner, leading to much comment that after holding them in something close to contempt since unification, the western power brokers have turned to easterners to guide them out of the country's economic crisis. The emergence of Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Platzeck probably does not constitute a broad trend, but analysts say they both represent some of the qualities of the generation now taking over in German politics. They are seen as potentially more pragmatic and less ideologically driven than those who have governed for the last half-century or so. Perhaps most significant, the new leaders are one step further removed from the earlier leadership's preoccupation with German history and the limitations it placed on their freedom of action. Not only is the generation represented by chancellors like Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl gone, after it brought West Germany safely through the cold war and into the era of unification. Gone, too, are the more recent politicians, like Mr. Schroder and his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who came of age during the 1960's student protests and who have dominated German politics for the last seven years. What takes their place is not entirely certain, in part because the newcomers are outsiders and have less of a track record than is normal for top political leaders here. Indeed, it is far from certain that the coalition government Mrs. Merkel will bring to power will last long enough to make much of an impact. But what is certain is that at a moment that everybody deems critical, the chiefs of both parties are different from what came before. ''It's an important symbol that the easterners have come to power,'' said Uwe Andersen, a political science professor at Ruhr University in Bochum. ''They have a more pragmatic way of doing things and they are used to big changes in life, and therefore, I think, they are not so reluctant to face up to new challenges.'' Another specialist on German politics, Claus Leggewie of Giessen University, predicts that the new leaders, in partial rebellion against the prior generation, will be more conservative and more focused on business and concrete problems. He also expects them to continue to move beyond the moral preoccupations of the German past. Mrs. Merkel takes power with the economy having stagnated for five years, unemployment at postwar highs and no national consensus about what to do about it. Indeed, as the price she had to pay for coming to power, Mrs. Merkel had to give the Social Democrats half of the seats in the cabinet and jettison, at least for now, many of the elements of her platform. In exchange for their deal to retain a 3 percent rise in sales taxes, a central part of her original program, Mrs. Merkel accepted an income tax increase to be imposed on the wealthy, even as her proposals to reduce labor costs by loosening job protection laws and reorganizing the health insurance system have been put off. Many Germans have criticized the deal to create a coalition as a lowest common denominator program inadequate to the task of reviving the economy. But the compromises that both sides have made seem to reflect the deep uncertainty within the electorate about how much of the country's elaborate social welfare system to give up for the sake of economic competitiveness. Much will depend on the character of the new leaders, and that is where the nature of the new generation governing Germany comes into play. Mrs. Merkel, the pastor's daughter who became a physicist and got involved in politics only after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, is not the only figure with such a background to emerge to power and prominence. Indeed, the similarities between Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Platzeck in that sense are remarkable. At 51, both are 10 years younger than the departing chancellor, Mr. Schroder. Like Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Platzeck was trained as a scientist, and became involved in politics only as the East German government was falling, and therefore, unlike the usual Social Democratic leader, did not have a long career working his way up through the ranks. Professor Andersen said the Social Democrats liked Mr. Platzeck for being relatively unknown. He responded to them with ''a very party-oriented speech,'' Mr. Andersen said. ''But I'm not sure he will stick to this position,'' the professor said, ''because he knows, as someone who was in power in a former Eastern state, that it's not possible to stick to the old social model anymore.''

4076,433644235.xml,"      Peter Loscher, the new chief executive of the engineering conglomerate Siemens, said Thursday that a top priority for his first 100 days on the job would be to simplify the byzantine organizational structure that may have contributed to a bribery scandal. The complexity of the company's far-flung operations, which are divided by both product category -- like power plant equipment, medical devices and light bulbs -- and by geographic region, is believed to have helped employees hide 420 million euros ($570 million) in suspicious payments. The company and German prosecutors are investigating those payments.   Mr. Loscher said the business structures and regional divisions would come under scrutiny as he prepared a new organizational plan. ''In the fall, I'll present our conclusions to the supervisory board, with these goals in mind: clear lines of responsibility, a high level of transparency and maximum speed,'' Mr. Loscher said in Berlin, where he was attending a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Mr. Loscher, the first Siemens chief to come from outside the company, will embark on a whirlwind tour of Siemens businesses. He will head first to China, India and Japan -- countries where he said the company had unrealized potential -- after a brief stop in his native Austria. He will also visit Siemens operations in Russia and the Persian Gulf. He spoke relatively little about the bribery scandal, which reached deeply  into Siemens and prompted the company's board to replace Klaus Kleinfeld, after he had served less than three years as chief executive. Mr. Loscher is a former executive with the American pharmaceutical maker Merck. Mr. Loscher vowed to investigate any wrongdoing and ''draw the necessary consequences.''  ''Performance with ethics -- this is not a contradiction, it is a must,'' he said. One of his first tasks will be to hire a new chief compliance officer to succeed Daniel Noa, a former German prosecutor, who left the post last month after only six months on the job. His successor ''will be an expert from outside the company with international experience,'' Mr. Loscher said. Instilling an ethical corporate culture ''is a marathon for us, not a sprint,'' he said. ''The important thing for us is that compliance becomes part of management culture internationally, from top to bottom and back again.'' Mr. Loscher said Siemens was already ''extraordinarily successful,'' but alluded to some changes. He wants to make the company's product portfolio ''more focused and less complex.'' Siemens stock, which has doubled over the last year, slipped 0.43 euro to close at 109.77 euros on Thursday. In New York, Siemens closed at $150.05, down 14 cents. Mr. Loscher also promised a decision before the end of the summer on whether to proceed with a planned initial public offering of Siemens VDO, an automotive parts manufacturer. The German automotive company Continental has said it is interested in buying VDO. He also raised an issue that has become a priority for many German executives: the need to get more young people into the technical professions that form the backbone of German industry. As exports have boomed in recent years, German companies have bemoaned a worsening shortage of qualified personnel. Mr. Loscher said the competitive edge of Germany was ''based on the power of innovation.'' ''To keep this advantage, we'll have to do everything in our power to eliminate the bottlenecks impeding the development of qualified young people,'' Mr. Loscher said. ''This is a major challenge, particularly in Germany.''  Peter Loscher, chief executive of the engineering conglomerate Siemens, at a news conference in Berlin yesterday.

3241,1687486732.xml,"       LONDON -- Amid growing debate in Europe over electronic spying, an independent report on Thursday called for changes to Britain's surveillance laws, arguing that they are undemocratic and opaque, and that they risk eroding confidence in the oversight of intelligence agencies. Seeking to balance fears over terrorist threats with concerns over privacy, the document highlighted growing challenges for the spy agencies, including encryption, and said they should be able to continue bulk collection of intercepted data, though with better oversight. But the report by a senior lawyer, David Anderson, argued that Britain's main legislation on electronic surveillance was ""incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates,"" a situation further confused by other laws ""without statutory safeguards."" ""This state of affairs is undemocratic, unnecessary and -- in the long run -- intolerable,"" said the 373-page document, the result of an inquiry which took almost a year to complete. The report was commissioned with cross-party support by an act of Parliament last year, but Prime Minister David Cameron is not obligated to make any of the recommended changes. There has been vigorous debate across Europe over potential threats to privacy, prompted by the release of documents two years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. In Germany, the government has been embroiled in a dispute over reports that its spies cooperated with the N.S.A., a source of embarrassment to Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who made her anger known when allegations surfaced that her own cellphone was monitored. The privacy issue is generally seen as less sensitive in Britain, partly because of greater support for the intelligence agencies, and worries about the potential threat from Britons returning home after fighting with jihadists in Syria and Iraq. But Mr. Anderson, who reviews the way the country's terrorism laws work, argued that this degree of consent was at risk because of the flawed approach to . ""The threat that I see of not accepting my recommendations, or recommendations along these lines,"" Mr. Anderson said, ""is that people become disenchanted with the whole business of intelligence gathering. They believe some of the wilder allegations that came out of the Snowden affair -- I would say unfounded wild allegations that the state is reading into people's emails the whole time when patently it isn't."" ""If this sense of disillusionment and disenchantment is perpetuated and spreads further,"" he said, ""then I think both law enforcement and intelligence lose the public confidence that they actually need if they are going to do an effective job."" In mid-2014, Mr. Anderson was asked to specifically examine powers given to the British authorities, including the interception of communications and electronic data. His main proposal calls for the creation of an Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission to oversee the intelligence agencies, which would include serving or retired judges who would provide judicial authorization for most surveillance warrants. Almost all such warrants are currently authorized by a senior minister in Britain. A new law ""should be drafted from scratch,"" the report said while also suggesting that the ""capability of the security and intelligence agencies to practice bulk collection of intercepted material and associated date should be retained."" Mr. Anderson told reporters that he was not recommending extensive new powers. ""I am saying there already are very extensive powers and they need to be properly regulated,"" he said. The document is significant because the British government wants to give the authorities new powers over electronic surveillance. The exact measures have not been made public, but they could force Internet service providers and mobile operators to record more data about whom people call, text, instant message and engage with on social media. The expanded authority, widely known as the ""snoopers charter,"" was blocked under the previous government by the junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats. But now that Mr. Cameron has been re-elected with a parliamentary majority, he is in a position to proceed. The findings of the Anderson review published Thursday are expected to feed into that plan for new legislation. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, said she would consider the findings but did not commit to abiding by them. Mr. Anderson was cautious about any move to force companies to retain the browsing history of their clients, but he argued that his proposals might make American technology companies more willing to cooperate with British intelligence agencies because some companies in the United States ""disliked"" the idea of ministers, rather than judges, authorizing warrants. ""One major company went so far as to suggest that if the U.K. introduced judicial authorization, more cooperation would be forthcoming, though I was not left with the impression that this was a universal view,"" the report said. Cian Murphy, a legal expert at King's College, London, welcomed the conclusions. ""The report acknowledges the challenges -- for both privacy and security -- in the current law and sets out a blueprint for a new legal architecture,"" he said. ""It gives Britain the best possible chance for effective and proportionate powers, in compliance with the law and protective of civil liberties."" There was also a positive reaction from Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a British group that campaigns for civil liberties. ""Whilst we don't agree with all his conclusions,"" she said in a statement, ""Mr. Anderson's intervention could be the beginning of rebuilding public trust in surveillance conducted with respect for privacy, democracy and the law. It is further vindication of Edward Snowden's courage."" Opposition politicians have argued that Britain has been slower to debate the issues than the United States. Critics have long argued that British laws are too broad, focusing particularly on the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. They say the act has allowed bodies like municipalities access to metadata for electronic activity -- information about emails, telephone calls and websites visited, but not the content. Surveillance can be authorized for purposes that include preventing disorder or collecting tax, according to Liberty. The police have also used the law to make applications to uncover the sources of journalists.  ",2015-06-12
913,878760179.xml,"      BERLIN -- The attacks in Oslo on Friday have riveted new attention on right-wing extremists not just in Norway but across Europe, where opposition to Muslim immigrants, globalization, the power of the European Union and the drive toward multiculturalism has proven a potent political force and, in a few cases, a spur to violence.   The success of populist parties appealing to a sense of lost national identity has brought criticism of minorities, immigrants and in particular Muslims out of the beer halls and Internet chat rooms and into mainstream politics. While the parties themselves generally do not condone violence, some experts say a climate of hatred in the political discourse has encouraged violent individuals.   ""I'm not surprised when things like the bombing in Norway happen, because you will always find people who feel more radical means are necessary,"" said Joerg Forbrig, an analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin who has studied far-right issues in Europe. ""It literally is something that can happen in a number of places and there are broader problems behind it.""    Last November a Swedish man was arrested in the southern city of Malmo in connection with more than a dozen unsolved shootings of immigrants, including one fatality. The shootings, nine of which took place between June and October 2010, appeared to be the work of an isolated individual. More broadly in Sweden, though, the far-right Sweden Democrats experienced new success at the polls. The party entered Parliament for the first time after winning 5.7 percent of the vote in the general election last September.   The bombing and shootings in Oslo also have served as a wake-up call for security services in Europe and the United States that in recent years have become so focused on Islamic terrorists that they may have underestimated the threat of domestic radicals, including those upset by what they see as the influence of Islam.    In the United States the deadly attacks have reawakened memories of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, where a right-wing extremist, Timothy J. McVeigh, used a fertilizer bomb to blow up a federal government building, killing 168 people. That deadly act had long since been overshadowed by the events of Sept. 11, 2001.   According to Mr. Forbrig, isolated right-wing groups in Europe would rise up and then quickly disappear from the '60s into the '90s. But in recent years far-right statements have appeared to lose much of their post-World War II taboo even among some prominent political parties.    A combination of increased migration from abroad and largely unrestricted movement of people within an enlarged European Union, such as the persecuted Roma minority, helped lay the groundwork for a nationalist, at times starkly chauvinist, revival.   Groups are gaining traction from Hungary to Italy, but it is particularly apparent in northern European countries that long have had liberal immigration policies. The rapid arrival of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants, many of them Muslims, led to a significant backlash in places like Denmark, where the Danish People's Party has 25 out of 179 seats in Parliament, and the Netherlands, where Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom won 15.5 percent of the vote in the 2010 general election.    Mr. Wilders famously compared the Koran, the holy book of Islam, to Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf."" Both the Danish and Dutch right-wing parties are backing precarious minority governments while not directly participating by having ministers, and inching toward mainstream acceptance in the process.   Friday's attacks were swiftly condemned by leaders from across the political spectrum in Europe. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was particularly sharp in speaking out against what she called an ""appalling crime."" The sort of hatred that could fuel such an action, she said, went against ""freedom, respect and the belief in peaceful coexistence.""   Yet some of the primary motivations cited by the suspect in Norway, Anders Behring Breivik, are now mainstream issues. Mrs. Merkel, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain all recently declared an end to multiculturalism. Multiculturalism ""has failed, utterly failed,"" Mrs. Merkel told fellow Christian Democrats last October, though stressing that immigrants were welcome in Germany.   Perhaps the most surprising about-turn came in Britain, a country that has long considered itself among the most immigrant-friendly in Europe until a series of coordinated bomb attacks in London six years ago. In one of his most noticed speeches, Mr. Cameron told the Munich security conference in February that the country's decades-old policy of multiculturalism had encouraged ""segregated communities"" where Islamic extremism can thrive.   France, a fiercely secularist state where all religion is banned from the public sphere, was long isolated and berated for its staunch opposition to the laissez-faire of multiculturalism. Girls who show up in public schools there with the Muslim headscarf are suspended, as are teachers or any other employees in the public sector.    If Mr. Sarkozy appeared to soften his understanding of official secularism, or ""laicite"" earlier in his political career, even toying with the idea of affirmative action, he has recently scrambled to backtrack. He held a nationwide debate on ""national identity"" last year and earlier this year banned Muslim full-face veils like niqab, as well as the burqa.   That hasn't stopped the far-right National Front, now led by Marine Le Pen, the daughter of its founder, to surge in opinion polls, with some surveys predicting that she might make it into next year's presidential runoff. She compared Muslims praying in the streets outside overcrowded mosques to the Nazi occupation, and decries the European Union and the euro.    Earlier this month the daily newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported that neo-Nazis were attacking the offices of the far-left Left Party with increasing frequency. In the former East German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, statistics showed that there were 30 such attacks in the first half of 2011 compared to 44 attacks in all of 2010.   Due to its Nazi past, Germany keeps a watchful eye on right-wing extremists, and the parties of the far right have a hard time gaining traction, with no representatives in Parliament. In Finland, the True Finns, a populist nationalist party founded in 1995, became the third largest party represented in the Finnish Parliament after winning 19 percent of the vote in April. And Norway's Progress Party, a right-wing populist party, is the second largest in the country, winning 23 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election in September 2009.   ""The Norwegian right-wing groups have always been disorganized, haven't had charismatic leaders or the kind of well-organized groups with financial support that you see in Sweden,"" said Kari Helene Partapuoli, director of the Norwegian Center against Racism. ""But in the last two or three years our organization and other antifascist networks have warned of an increased temperature of debate and that violent groups had been established.""    But neither does Norway exist in a vacuum. Its right-wing scene is connected to the rest of Europe through the Internet forums where hate speech proliferates and through right-wing demonstrations that draw an international mix of participants.    ""This may be the act of a lone, mad, paranoid individual,"" said Hajo Funke, a political scientist at the Free University in Berlin who studies rightist extremism, referring to the right-wing fundamentalist Christian charged in connection with the killings, ""but the far-right milieu creates an atmosphere that can lead such people down that path of violence.""

FILE -- A person is vaccinated at a COVID-19 vaccination site in Rivoli, Italy, on April 29, 2021. Several countries are allowing mix-and-match inoculation, which scientists hope will have benefits. (Alessandro Grassani/The New York Times)


The most widely used coronavirus vaccines are designed as two-shot inoculations, and nearly everyone worldwide who has had both doses has received the same vaccine both times.
But that is changing, as more countries are allowing — and even, in some cases, encouraging — mix-and-match inoculation, with people receiving a first shot of one vaccine and then a second shot of a different one. On Tuesday, Germany’s government revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, had received two different shots, adding to the growing interest in the practice.
Some nations have tried that approach out of necessity, when supplies of a particular vaccine ran short, or out of caution, when questions were raised about the safety of a shot after some people had already received their first doses. U.S. regulators so far have been reluctant to encourage the practice.
But scientists and health policymakers are interested in the possibility that giving different shots to the same person could have significant advantages.
Here are some common questions raised by mix-and-match vaccination.
What are the potential benefits?

Mixing vaccines — scientists call it “heterologous prime-boost” — is not a new idea, and researchers have experimented with it in fighting a handful of other diseases, including Ebola.
Scientists have long theorized that giving people two slightly different vaccines might generate a stronger immune response, perhaps because the vaccines stimulate slightly different parts of the immune system or teach it to recognize different parts of an invading virus.
“The argument is that one and one makes three,” said John Moore, a virus expert at Weill Cornell Medicine. “How well that argument holds up in practice in the COVID area is going to need to be judged by the actual data.”
In addition to the potential immunological benefits, mixing and matching also “offers much-needed flexibility when vaccine supplies are uneven or limited,” said Zhou Xing, an immunologist at McMaster University in Canada.
What do the data say?

Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to determine whether there are benefits or drawbacks. Researchers at the University of Oxford are testing different combinations of vaccines — including the AstraZeneca-Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax shots — in the Com-Cov trial, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health recently launched a trial of mixed booster doses.
Russian researchers are testing a combination of their Sputnik V vaccine and the AstraZeneca shot. Sputnik is, itself, somewhat based on a mix-and-match approach, with the first and second shots having different formulations.
Most studies are still in early stages, but some have released promising preliminary results. Last month, for instance, a team of Spanish researchers announced that people who received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by a dose of the Pfizer vaccine, showed a robust immune response.
This regimen appeared to elicit a stronger immune response than two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Xing said. Whether it is better than two doses of the Pfizer vaccine is not yet clear.
Is it safe?

Preliminary data from the Com-Cov study suggests that mixing and matching vaccines may increase the odds of mild and moderate side effects, including fever, fatigue and headache.
The data suggests that a mismatched regimen “might have some short-term disadvantages,” the researchers wrote, although it is also possible that the side effects may be a sign of a strong immune response. Most side effects faded within 48 hours, they found.
Overall, scientists say that they expect the data to show that the approach is safe.
“As we’ve learned in 18 months of COVID-19 shocks, never say never, but its really hard to rationalize any new risk associated with what is really a basic, tried and tested immunological approach,” Daniel Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said in an email.
Where is this happening?

Health authorities in a variety of countries are allowing some degree of mixing and matching. The United Kingdom began allowing vaccine mixing in the early days of its vaccine rollout.
Officials in a number of countries — including Germany, Canada, Sweden, France, Spain and Italy — have said that people who have received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder, can receive a different vaccine for their second shot. In response to delayed deliveries of the AstraZeneca shot, South Korea announced last week that health care workers who had received a first dose of that vaccine could receive the Pfizer shot as a second dose.
Canada’s vaccine advisory panel has also said that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can be used interchangeably.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been more conservative. The agency says people who got one dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine may receive a second dose of the other in “exceptional situations,” such as when the original vaccine is not available.
“I cannot imagine that the FDA will allow this kind of mix-and-match strategy without properly evaluating clinical trial data,” Moore said.
Why did Merkel get two different shots?

Germany is fiercely protective of medical privacy, even that of its leaders, but Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, suggested that her vaccine choices were in part about setting an example.
Isolated reports of abnormal clotting and bleeding prompted many European countries to suspend use of the AstraZeneca shot in March. Most of them, including Germany, resumed its use a few weeks later, after a review by the European Union’s drug regulator.
But when Merkel got the AstraZeneca shot in April, many people remained deeply skeptical of it, slowing the vaccination campaign.
“With her first vaccination with AstraZeneca, the chancellor was possibly able to encourage many people to get vaccinated with AstraZeneca,” Seibert told reporters Wednesday.

Germany’s vaccine commission recommended in April that anyone younger than 60 who had received a first shot of AstraZeneca should follow it up with either Pfizer or Moderna. Regulators relaxed that advice this month, but Merkel got the Moderna vaccine a few days ago.
“Perhaps she can also relieve people of their worries about a so-called ‘cross-vaccination’ by getting one herself,” Seibert said.
It was not clear why she had the Moderna shot, when there is considerable national pride in Germany about the work of BioNTech, a German company.
Moore said he saw no problem with mixing vaccines, but he was curious about what expert advice Merkel had received about it. He said he doubted that an American president would have done the same at this stage of the pandemic, because U.S. regulators, who are extremely cautious, have not approved it.

427,1695723580.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. GRAFENRHEINFELD, Germany -- In one of this country's most popular novels for young readers, the nuclear reactor on the edge of this Bavarian town melts down, spewing a radioactive cloud that threatens all of Germany and robs a 14-year-old girl of her family and her hope for the future. Last month, that nuclear power plant in Grafenrheinfeld, responsible for meeting the energy needs of industry-heavy Bavaria since 1981, came to a less dramatic but equally symbolic end. The plant became the first active reactor to be decommissioned since 2011, following Chancellor Angela Merkel's about-face on nuclear power after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant catastrophe in Japan. Taking Grafenrheinfeld offline is a milestone in Germany's push to establish a nuclear-free energy system by 2022, but also one made possible by its determination to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020. The plant can be closed because it has already been replaced by alternative energy sources like solar and wind. But while Germany has made substantial progress in its energy transformation policy, its aspiration is being put to the test by new political, technological and economic challenges as it moves into the next phase of the effort. How it deals with the obstacles could go a long way in determining whether the country becomes a model for moving toward a reduced- or even post-carbon economy. ""The exit is taking place at a pace that is breathtaking, even for those of us who were always for it, and the transition to a decarbonized economy is not without great challenges that only come at a price,"" Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's minister for energy and the economy, told industry leaders last month. Current projections indicate that Germany needs to speed up the pace of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions if it wants to meet its 2020 goals. Shifts in the energy market, including the persistently high price of natural gas in Europe and economic and political disincentives to move away from coal, have resulted in higher emissions than originally predicted. Europe's failure to set up an effective carbon market that would encourage emission reductions has also contributed. At the same time, under political pressure, the government was forced to back down from a proposal to impose fees on the oldest, and dirtiest, power plants, to encourage their phaseout. Yet Grafenrheinfeld is a good example of how Germany's efforts have already transformed its energy picture. The plant, nestled in the Main River valley, generated roughly 14 percent of the electricity for the state of Bavaria, home to companies including Siemens and the carmakers BMW and Audi, as well as nearly six million households. But now renewable energy sources, predominantly solar and hydro power, contribute electricity roughly equivalent to that produced by the nuclear plant, and officials said they were confident that was sufficient to maintain stability on the electricity grid. ""We have made substantial progress with expansion of renewable energy in Bavaria, to the extent we will be able to cover most of the capacity lost through renewables,"" Ilse Aigner, Bavaria's minister for energy and the economy, said before the plant was taken offline. Even greater progress has been made across Germany. Renewable energy sources accounted for 26 percent of its gross electricity production last year, double the 13 percent of the United States but lagging neighboring Denmark, which is generating more than 30 percent of its electricity through wind power alone. Even in the town of Grafenrheinfeld, solar panels glint from the roofs of homes and that of the local horseback riding club's indoor arena, as distinct a part of the skyline as the bulbous church spires and the reactor's twin cooling towers. The expansion of alternative energy has led to a decline in the price of raw power, rendering nuclear power plants like the one in Grafenrheinfeld, once the cash cows of the energy industry, unprofitable. The Grafenrheinfeld plant was not scheduled to be shut until December, but E.On, the utility that owns it, decommissioned the reactor ahead of schedule to save on costs. Still, the most recent projections show Germany will need to cut an additional 22 million metric tons of carbon emissions within the next five years if it is to meet its targets. Germany's energy ministry in December proposed closing the gap by imposing penalties on the oldest lignite coal-fired power plants that are the prime emitters. In response, 15,000 miners traveled in buses to the German capital in late April, blowing whistles and waving banners to denounce the proposal, which union leaders said would mean a loss of thousands of jobs. Officials in Berlin recently adopted an alternative, drawn up in consensus with unions and industry leaders. Instead of being required to cover the full gap of 22 metric tons, the industry will be expected to reduce carbon emissions by about half that. The difference is to be made up largely through subsidies to improve efficiency in heating generation and consumption, which could prove more costly to consumers. The alternative plan comes as Germany looks to the next chapter of its emissions reduction program: cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 55 percent of 1990 levels by 2030, while at the same time increasing renewable sources to about 50 percent of energy production. ""We are now headed into a more challenging phase of the energy transition,"" said Patrick Graichen, who heads Agora Energiewende, a research center in Berlin devoted to explaining the energy transition program. ""Reaching the first 25 percent went swiftly, as they were largely absorbed by the existing system. But now reaching the 50 percent mark will mean transforming the system."" Shutting the nuclear plants, which do not emit carbon but have other risks, would seem to be contradictory at such a time. Ms. Merkel surprised many in 2012 when she reversed an earlier policy, announcing the immediate closing of eight nuclear power plants and plans to shutter the remaining nine by 2022. But Ms. Merkel faced political pressure on that front as well -- powerfully illustrated in Gudrun Pausewang's 1987 best seller ""The Cloud,"" read by generations of German high school students. Its depiction of a catastrophic meltdown helped raise public support for alternative energy sources. Gaby Gehrold, who lives five miles away in Schweinfurt, was one of thousands of demonstrators who had sought an end to nuclear power. ""I think that we have set an example that we are serious about the energy transformation and our desire to see it continue, to ensure that all nuclear reactors need to be shut off,"" she said. Not everyone feels that way. Gerhard Riegler, a self-described ""dyed-in-the-wool"" Grafenrheinfelder who has worked at the reactor since its beginning, said the closing means a loss of jobs and tax revenue, but most of all a loss of pride. ""It is like having a car that for years you have cleaned and maintained and kept in running condition, but suddenly someone comes along and says you have to get rid of it. Just like that,"" said Mr. Riegler, who is also the town's deputy mayor. ""It hurts."" Every part of the country's energy transition has had winners and losers. Yet while Germans have seen electricity prices rise to finance renewable sources -- a three-person household now pays 29.13 euro cents per kilowatt-hour, including a renewable-energy surcharge of 6.17 euro cents -- they have expressed deep and lasting support for the change. In an October 2014 nationwide survey by TNS Emnid  for the Agency for Renewable Energies, 92 percent of Germans said they supported the expansion of renewable energy sources. ""In Germany we are now seeing the brakes put on, out of a need to protect coal, as they used to protect nuclear,"" said Hans-Josef Fell, a former lawmaker for the Green Party who fought Grafenrheinfeld from its start, but has now shifted his attention to fighting efforts to restrict the expansion of wind farms in Bavaria. ""That will continue for a bit, but not for much longer. It is not sustainable for much longer.""

Correction:  July 19, 2015, Sunday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about challenges for Germany as it transforms to a nuclear-free energy system, starting with the decommissioning of a nuclear plant in Bavaria, misstated the price that Germans now pay for electricity, and referred imprecisely to prices a decade ago. A household of three now pays 29.13 euro cents per kilowatt-hour -- not 6.17 euro cents, which is the amount of a surcharge for renewable energy. And it is that surcharge -- not the total energy cost -- that is about 10 times what it was a decade ago. The article also misstated the position of Hans-Josef Fell, a former lawmaker for the Green Party, toward wind farms in Bavaria. He is fighting efforts to restrict their expansion, not trying to restrict them. Solar Panels Are Commonplace Now in Grafenrheinfeld, Where a Nuclear Plant Was Shut Last Month.

3877,1647786641.xml,"       ATHENS -- Driving along a broad avenue lined with restaurants, the Greek man at the wheel points to the trash cans. Every night, he says, people rummage through them for scraps of food. His two well-educated daughters cannot find jobs; more than half of Greek youths have no work, and the jobs that do appear are often short-term and lacking in benefits. Such stories of misery are legion after six years of economic crisis -- including stories of suicides, of housewives turning to prostitution. Listening to them, the only surprise in the rise of the left-wing Syriza party, which is expected to come in first in Sunday's general election, is that it has taken so long for an anti-austerity party to come to the fore. Alexis Tsipras, Syriza's charismatic 40-year-old leader, has been campaigning under the banner ""Hope is on its way."" He has vowed to undo the austerity program mandated by the troika of international creditors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- and at the same time to somehow reduce the country's debt and remain in the eurozone. Fulfilling these contradictory promises may not be possible, but to a lot of people that's not the point -- voting for Syriza is another way of saying ""Enough."" The incumbent prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has insisted that the radical left wants to drive Greece out of the euro, and that the only path for Greece is to stay the course of painful reforms and budget cuts that he has led. Recent opinion polls showed Mr. Samaras's center-right New Democracy party only four to six percentage points behind Syriza. So even if Syriza does come in first, it will probably need a coalition to form a government. Given the variety of parties and passions likely to come out of the elections, the next government may not be around for long. All this makes for a frightening welter of unknowns as voters approach decision time. If Mr. Tsipras goes ahead with his promise to cut taxes and restore social spending without finding new sources of funding, the ""troika"" bailout could be cut short. Without the bailout, Greece would face the risk of a default on its massive sovereign debt. And failing to meet its debts would raise the possibility of a ""Grexit,"" a Greek exit from the eurozone. Though Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has the decisive say in what demands to make of Greece, insists she wants Greece to remain in the eurozone, the possibility of a Greek exit is no longer regarded in Berlin and Brussels as necessarily an unmitigated disaster.  For the Greeks, however, it would be, most likely plunging the country into recession, and the large majority of Greeks want the country to remain in the single currency. In any case, Mr. Tsipras has given signals that he may be open to a more sensible course than his radical party platform. Polls show that a strong majority of Greeks, 61 percent, want consensus in talks with the troika, and the optimistic scenario is that his left-wing credentials would give him the credibility to urge more patience.  Another question is whether Berlin and Brussels really mean their tough talk about Greece. Mrs. Merkel repeated in her keynote speech at Davos that Greece must accept responsibility for its mountain of debt. But there seems to be a growing sentiment among economists in Europe that debt relief is essential to bringing the Greek economy back from the depths. Whether Greeks ""deserve"" punishing austerity after years of profligacy, as many in northern Europe continue to maintain, is not the right question. The question is how to allow Greece to move forward and to avoid a political catastrophe that would inevitably have ramifications for the rest of Europe. Mr. Tsipras or whoever wins Sunday's election must understand that there is no easy, painless exit out of Greece's troubles. But Germany and the troika must understand that sticking with their flawed and dogmatic insistence on austerity can only create more misery and desperation -- and a more radical response next time.

1603,1941672398.xml,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's summons to Germany's top cabinet ministers and senior military and intelligence officials for a meeting of the Federal Security Council signaled trouble. Such gatherings are rare, typically occurring only when the country faces a grave threat like a terrorist attack.There was just one item on the agenda that day last spring: how to protect Germany's upcoming parliamentary elections from Russian cyberattacks. At the time, it seemed almost inevitable that Germany would suffer the same fate as France and the United States, where, officials say, the Kremlin attempted to alter the results of presidential elections with ""fake news"" and spear phishing attacks.But on the eve of Sunday's elections, the Russians have done something few expected: they have largely disappeared. The trolls who spread distorted and falsified information before earlier elections have failed to make much of a splash here. The websites of the campaigns and major news media outlets are operating like normal.Germans, according to Sandro Gaycken, the director of the Digital Society Institute in Berlin, which has been monitoring for Russian meddling, are ""almost disappointed that nothing is happening.""""We don't see any verified attacks,"" he said. ""We're not really expecting any Russian interference.""In some respects, experts say, German elections are insulated from outside interference in ways those in the United States are not. The country's politics are not as polarized as they are in the United States, where partisan enmity provided fertile ground for Russian efforts to sow confusion with distorted and falsified information amplified by Russian-controlled Twitter bots and Facebook accounts.In a move that would seem unimaginable in the United States, the campaigns for the major political parties entered into a ""gentleman's agreement"" this year not to exploit any information that might be leaked as a result of a cyberattack.Germans also still largely trust their mainstream, traditional news media sources and, unlike Americans, tend to be wary of information disseminated on Facebook and Twitter.Officials warn that there is still a chance that some 16 gigabytes of sensitive information stolen two years ago by Kremlin-backed hackers from Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, could surface, much like emails taken from the campaign of Emanuel Macron were dumped days before the election in France.In January, someone registered two websites, btleaks.info and btleaks.org, which reminiscent of the DCLeaks website that served as a repository for documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee last year. Staffers from Germany's domestic intelligence agency have been assigned to check those websites hourly.But few think the information if leaked would make much difference at this point. The latest polls show Ms. Merkel in a comfortable lead ahead of her chief rivals, making it likely that she will secure a fourth term as chancellor.So why has Russia held back?After failing to defeat Mr. Macron or so far obtain any positive dividends from its support of the Trump campaign, it is possible, experts say, that the Kremlin has decided to rethink its approach.Russian influence operations, or active measures as they are known, tend to work only if no one is expecting them. Unlike the Obama administration, which chose to remain silent about Russia's meddling for months before the election last November, German officials cannot seem to stop talking about the threat.Weeks after the election of President Trump, Bruno Kahl, the head of Germany's foreign intelligence service, the BND, warned of cyberattacks aimed at ""delegitimizing the democratic process"" in Germany. Ms. Merkel herself has issued similar warnings.""It makes absolutely no sense to conduct cyber-ops because everyone is waiting for it,"" Dr. Gaycken said. ""It would almost make more sense for the C.I.A. to leak fake news to make it seem like the Russians did it.""Ripjar, a data analytics company founded by former members of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, says that scores of automated bots on Twitter and other social media sites have been pushing anti-Merkel and anti-immigrant messaging in German. The messages appear to align with Kremlin positions ahead of the election, but do not seem to have had much resonance.""It is a very blunt tool that I would assess has very little impact on the world,"" said David Balson, Ripjar's director of intelligence.Perhaps Germany's greatest protection is not some 21st century innovation but old-fashioned paper ballots, counted by hand, that are essentially hack proof.It would be a mistake to think the aggressive Russian interference in elections last year represented some kind of new norm, said Thomas Rid, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who is writing a book on Russian active measures. These types of operations, he said, are extremely difficult to pull off and, as the world has seen, can backfire. In many ways, he said, the Russians just got lucky.""I think one of the risks of the 2016 operation is that we all overestimate how much you can achieve from it and how easy it is,"" he said. ""You just can't replicate this in the country every time.""Nevertheless, Germans prepared well in advance for any hint of Russian interference.The Federal Office for Information Security ran penetration tests looking for vulnerabilities in computer systems and software of the federal election authority. The Bundestag and the individual campaigns consulted with experts about strengthening their computer security. And major news media outlets established teams of fact checkers to protect against fake news.German officials are now looking beyond the elections at ways to bolster the country's cyberdefenses even further.At the Federal Security Council meeting, which was held in March, officials hammered out what has become known as the ""hack-back"" strategy. The plan is to try to turn the tables on the hackers, launching offensive cyberattacks against them and destroying their online infrastructure before any real damage can be done.While the German military can now legally launch a cyber-offensive following hacker attacks on military resources, there is no provision in German law allowing for the country's cyber forces to respond to attacks on civilian infrastructure like the power grid, hospitals or servers that process election results.""Our cyber-defenses are Swiss cheese,"" said Jacob Schrot, a Bundestag staffer responsible for intelligence oversight and cybersecurity matters.Russia is not the only threat on this front. Germans are still angry about revelations made by Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency under President Barack Obama had hacked into Ms. Merkel's cellphone.Though a precise plan of action has yet to be implemented, that federal authorities would even consider taking offensive action against an enemy is a measure of how seriously the country has come to view the cyber threat.Enduring trauma of the Nazi era has made Germans squeamish about flexing their country's military muscles. But Russia's recent history of revanchism under President Vladimir V. Putin -- not just interfering in elections but supporting hard-right nationalist parties in Europe and dabbling in military adventures, like the annexation of Crimea and instigation of war in eastern Ukraine -- has forced Germans to confront a new reality.Marian Wendt, a member of Parliament from Ms. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, who oversees cybersecurity issues, said in an interview that Germany would prefer cooperation with Mr. Putin and Russia. But he said Germany also had a responsibility to protect itself.""At some point you have to attack your attackers,"" he said.The hack-back strategy has stirred controversy here, with some charging that it comes close to violating Germany's constitutional prohibition of offensive warfare adopted after the country's defeat in World War II. Cyber experts also question whether Germany possesses the technical expertise to pull off such a tactic, particularly against Russia's own highly advanced teams of cyber warriors.""Our main challenge right now is a shortage of skilled I.T. security workers,"" said Sven Herpig, a cybersecurity expert with a German think tank, Stiftung Neue Verantwortung. ""Why do we waste the few talents that we have on the offensive side when we could actually use them on the defensive side.""Germany's talk of offensive cyber actions could also escalate tensions with the Kremlin, said Mr. Rid, from Johns Hopkins University. And with Russia quiet at the moment, many question the wisdom of provoking it.""Loose German talk of hack-back,"" Mr. Rid said, ""could translate into Russian as 'bring it on.""'Protesters Rallied Against Chancellor Angela Merkel and Her Party at a Campaign Event This Month in Torgau, Germany.

3292,1739282805.xml,"       BERLIN --  The German Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday to send reconnaissance planes, a frigate and midair fueling capacity to the Middle East to support the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, although German forces will not be involved in direct combat like airstrikes. The vote -- with 445 in favor, 146 against, and seven abstentions -- was expected, given the large parliamentary majority commanded by Chancellor Angela Merkel's ""grand coalition"" government of center-right and center-left. Twenty-eight Social Democrats and just two Christian Democrats joined the opposition -- the Greens and the Left party -- in opposing the deployment. Three Greens voted for the military action. Even 70 years after World War II, Germany remains wary of using its military outside the NATO alliance, and such missions require parliamentary approval. The government said action was essential because the turmoil in the Middle East was increasingly affecting events at home, from the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees to terrorist alerts and risky missions overseas for Germany's all-volunteer armed forces. The vote came only eight days after the government first pledged to meet requests from Germany's closest European ally, France, for assistance in targeting the Islamic State in Syria after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in and around Paris. ""The Paris attacks have forced us in Europe to realize that the Middle East is not somewhere distant like South America,"" said Norbert Röttgen, head of Parliament's foreign affairs committee. ""It is our neighbor,"" he added, ""and we Europeans must take responsibility for this region."" Thomas Oppermann, the Social Democrats' leader in Parliament, noted that the government had been compelled to move swiftly because France had asked for help. ""We can act quickly when that is needed,"" yet with sufficient debate to enable a responsible decision, he said. The opposition attacked the government for its rapid response, however, and it charged that Berlin was relying solely on what it described as an ill-considered military action to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. ""War is terror that breeds more terror,"" Sahra Wagenknecht, co-leader of the Left party, told Parliament. Part of the reason the government moved so quickly was that both major parties in the coalition will have annual congresses starting in a week, and that they apparently wanted the military deployment question settled beforehand. Lawmakers from both parties cited the deployment in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a precedent; the opposition called that comparison unfortunate, noting the continuing turmoil and insecurity in Afghanistan 14 years later. The government also moved quickly to capitalize on public outrage over the attacks in Paris, said Henning Riecke, trans-Atlantic director at the German Council on Foreign Relations. The parliamentary vote came as a new national opinion poll indicated solid support for military action. The poll showed that 59 percent of respondents supported the plan for limited deployment that the government had proposed and that 34 percent would back airstrikes in Syria; 22 percent would even be prepared to deploy ground troops. The poll for the public service broadcaster ARD and the daily Die Welt was conducted from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1, with 1,003 respondents and a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, according to the pollster Infratest Dimap. The same poll also showed that Ms. Merkel, whose personal popularity ratings slipped recently during the refugee crisis, had recovered five percentage points in the past month, putting her at 54 percent. In the past two years, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a Christian Democrat, and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, have been among the strongest advocates of more robust German leadership in global affairs, including military action if necessary. Both, however, have taken care to cast the relatively modest assistance for France as part of a broader strategy to end Syria's four-and-a-half-year war. The deployment of six Tornado reconnaissance planes, satellite radar, the frigate to support a French aircraft carrier, and the midair fueling capacity ""is part of a policy,"" Mr. Steinmeier told Parliament this week during the three-day debate on deployment. ""It is not a substitute for policy."" ""We are going to need patience,"" Ms. von der Leyen said, emphasizing that lasting success against the Islamic State would require local ground forces who knew the terrain and would fight for their home. The Germans hope that some of the hundreds of militias fighting in Syria will negotiate local cease-fires and then turn collectively against the Islamic State, she said Thursday. The deployment will probably involve about 1,200 members of the German armed forces, in addition to 650 who will be sent to Mali in the coming weeks to relieve French troops battling Islamic extremists in the former French colony. Dr. Riecke said the dangers to soldiers in Mali might well prove greater than to those armed forces members involved in the limited Middle East mission. Germany clearly wants to be able to play a role as mediator, or enabler, of talks, Dr. Riecke added. While Ms. Merkel has been a strong voice on the need to take in refugees, she has not been prominent in the debate on deployment. Instead, the foreign and defense ministers have been in the public eye. On Thursday, Ms. von der Leyen appeared to concede that critics had a legitimate argument when they questioned whether Germany's military had the bandwidth for these deployments. In recent weeks, the Army has undertaken increased duties at home as the country accommodates the new refugees. Further questions about Germany's military capacity arose this week when the Defense Ministry made clear that only 30 of about 60 aging Tornado planes were ready for deployment.

2018,433423906.xml,"      When Christian Streiff took the helm of Airbus after a boardroom purge in July, he described his first days at the troubled European plane maker as a ''vertical takeoff'' with ''full thrust.'' Three months later, Mr. Streiff's ride has ended after an equally sudden nosedive. On Monday, the corporate parent of Airbus, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, announced that he had resigned and would be succeeded by the French co-chief executive of EADS, Louis Gallois. The shake-up came after a clash between Mr. Streiff, 52, and EADS executives over how much autonomy he had to overhaul Airbus, which has been plagued by manufacturing chaos and delays in the delivery of its flagship plane, the A380. To manage the crisis, Mr. Streiff demanded considerable leeway, devising a plan to cut 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) a year in costs at Airbus. But EADS has been determined to assert its control over the company since last June, when it was caught off guard by costly delays in the production of the A380. ''We said Airbus would be integrated more closely into the EADS group,'' said Christian Poppe, the head of communications at EADS in Munich. ''He would have been aware of that when he took the job. Obviously, he didn't pay too much attention to this political orientation.'' A spokeswoman for Airbus, Barbara Kracht, declined to comment, saying it was a decision of the EADS board. The problems at Airbus are likely to give a lift to Boeing, which is in a growing position to exploit the delays in the A380. Only 10 months ago, the two companies were in a close race for orders, though Boeing never really tried to match the Airbus bet on the A380. All that has changed. Even amid the greatest crisis in its history, executives at Airbus said Mr. Streiff was moving too fast for the taste of EADS's shareholders -- an amalgam of German, French and Spanish state and private interests. The choice of Mr. Gallois to take over Airbus somewhat clarifies the tangled management of the company. An industrialist who once ran the French railway, Mr. Gallois will keep his title at EADS and be responsible for commercial aircraft, thus Airbus. The German co-chief executive of EADS, Thomas Enders, who used to oversee Airbus, will take charge of just the military business. Still, analysts say, this latest shake-up will only deepen the doubts that have coalesced around Airbus, which has been in more or less constant turmoil since the A380 program went off track. ''It sends a very bad signal, a crisis of confidence,'' said Alexandra Ashbourne, an aerospace consultant based in London. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said: ''Streiff was making drastic changes in production arrangements. His ability to do this was a step in the right direction.'' The trouble is that Mr. Streiff's boldest ideas -- like moving the production of the A380 from Hamburg, Germany, to Toulouse, in southwest France -- collided with political interests in Germany, which, along with France, is the most influential state backer of this European project. Airbus employs 12,000 people in Germany, and officials in Berlin warned Mr. Enders last week not to make Germany bear the brunt of cutbacks. On Monday, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, repeated the message, saying, ''It's important to us that German factories be treated equally, in view of the current difficulties.'' Mr. Gallois is expected to retain the outlines of Mr. Streiff's plan, which was approved by EADS on Oct. 3. But executives at Airbus said they expected the pace of change to be slower than under Mr. Streiff, an executive who came from the glass-making company Saint-Gobain. Mr. Poppe said Mr. Gallois would fill in the details of the plan, which is called Power 8, and would make another presentation to the EADS board, probably early next year. He said it was too soon to speculate on whether Airbus would shut plants or shift production around Europe. The announcement late on Monday capped three days of drama during which Mr. Streiff submitted, and withdrew, at least one letter of resignation to the board of EADS, according to executives. ''I progressively came to the conviction that the mode of corporate governance at Airbus didn't allow for the success of my plan,'' Mr. Streiff said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, to be published Tuesday. After a weekend of reports that his exit was imminent, he won an endorsement on Sunday evening from Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France, who said in a televised interview, ''He is doing a formidable job, and there is no reason for Christian Streiff's resignation.'' But Mr. Streiff had lost the confidence of Mr. Enders and of the major German shareholder in EADS, DaimlerChrysler. ''He was saying, 'I'll come to Munich three times a year and present my case, but otherwise, I want to be left completely alone,' '' said an executive at DaimlerChrysler, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation. ''People thought it was really strange.'' With President Jacques Chirac of France scheduled to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Thursday, there was pressure to resolve the impasse quickly. Mr. Gallois was the most obvious alternative. A diplomatic 62-year-old, he has long experience with state-linked companies, through the French railway operator, SNCF, and Aerospatiale, an aerospace company, which he ran from 1992 to 1996. He was also acceptable to DaimlerChrysler -- a critical consideration, since the German automaker balked at giving this much authority to his predecessor as co-chief executive of EADS, Noel Forgeard. Mr. Forgeard was ousted -- along with Mr. Streiff's predecessor at Airbus, Gustav Humbert -- after the company surprised even its parent with the disclosure of A380 delay. In an interview at the Farnborough International Air Show in July, Mr. Gallois said the board of EADS had not been properly informed about flaws in the wiring of the A380, a giant plane that seats 555 passengers. ''We feel we could increase disclosure,'' Mr. Gallois said. ''That doesn't mean to dilute responsibility.'' Among the challenges facing Mr. Gallois will be holding on to existing orders for the A380, which is now two years behind schedule. Executives at Airbus said John J. Leahy, the company's chief commercial officer, just completed a global tour of carriers that had ordered the plane. While none have yet canceled or cut back their orders, the prospect of further turmoil could cause them to rethink their orders. Airbus is essentially building the first 22 A380's by hand to deliver planes to major customers like Emirates and Singapore Airlines before 2009. With no profits flowing in from the A380, Mr. Gallois must also find financial resources to develop the A350 XWB, a medium-size plane that is the Airbus answer to the popular Boeing 787. Perhaps most daunting, Mr. Gallois must deal with an ownership structure that is growing more complicated. Russia recently acquired a 5 percent stake in EADS, through a state-owned bank, Vneshtorgbank. Russian officials are already talking about seeking a seat on the EADS board -- something that is currently restricted to the founding shareholders. ''This company needs private-sector cash, but government won't step out of the way,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''It's just tough to navigate through this maze.''  Louis Gallois, the co-chairman of EADS, was chosen to succeed Christian Streiff to head Airbus. (Photo by Remy de la Mauviniere/Associated Press)(pg.

566,1690976178.xml,"       BERLIN --  With Greece embroiled in civil war and the shadow of Soviet domination looming over Europe in 1947, President Harry S. Truman called for ""immediate and resolute action,"" putting up hundreds of millions of dollars to keep Greece in the Western camp. A failure to aid Greece ""in this fateful hour,"" Mr. Truman warned, would have repercussions ""far-reaching to the West as well as to the East."" Almost 70 years later, the present bears echoes of the past. Its politics deeply divided, Greece is mired in a terrible depression, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is doing his best to fan the embers of a new East-West standoff. But this time, the critical player is Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. As the de facto leader of the European Union, she is a crucial voice in deciding whether, in 2015, Greece is worth the cost -- 240 billion euros, or about $270 billion, and counting in bailout money -- to keep it in the European fold. The brinkmanship over Greece's finances is now entering what officials on all sides say is a decisive phase, with a meeting late Wednesday of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels and a two-day summit meeting beginning on Thursday of European Union leaders, where Ms. Merkel will once again be first among equals. Beyond finances, the outcome of those negotiations will have lasting ramifications for European unity and security, raising profound questions about Ms. Merkel's leadership and about her legacy as a primary driver of five years of austerity policies that Greeks blame for pushing them to a precipice. It is a signature moment that may well define Ms. Merkel's nearly a decade in power, and reveal whether her vision for the bloc transcends Germany's penchant for rules and its domestic politics, and even whether Berlin is prepared to play a leadership role on the global stage. Some financial experts say that Europe could absorb a Greek exit from the eurozone, despite the many questions that departure would raise for creditor nations forced to write off hundreds of billions of euros. But, political analysts warn, a Greek exit from the euro could set off a chaotic switch to a largely devalued currency. That could almost instantly create a disgruntled and impoverished Greece, run by a far-left government already friendly with Mr. Putin, providing the Russian leader with an even firmer handhold to divide Europe. ""Russia uses every opportunity to divide and weaken the European Union,"" Rosen Plevneliev, the president of Greece's northern and poorer neighbor, Bulgaria, said in an interview on Wednesday. ""What is happening in Greece is geopolitical as well as economic,"" he added. ""Of course we worry. We follow very closely what is happening."" Ms. Merkel is also no doubt worried. Germany ""is being forced to widen the prism through which it looks at the crisis,"" said Mark Leonard, head of the London-based European Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's not just about the economic rules anymore."" Ms. Merkel finds herself confronted with at least three crises in Europe: a potential exit from the euro currency by Greece, the danger that Britain might leave the European Union, and a newly assertive Russia. Often accused by critics of preferring tactics over strategy, or a cool approach over emotional commitment to Europe, Ms. Merkel is trying to bolster European unity in each case. Keeping Greece in Europe has been a strategic consideration since 1947, when Mr. Truman declared his commitment -- as NATO was being formed -- to Greece and Turkey in what became known as the Truman Doctrine. Greece went through a brutal three-year civil war that erupted after World War II. In the late 1960s and early '70s, it was ruled by a military junta. In 1981, the country was readmitted into the European fold, joining what was then called the European Community. In 2001, it entered the eurozone without European, German or other officials raising serious questions about what Athens acknowledged in 2009 were cooked figures. At a conference last weekend in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, Greece found its way onto an agenda originally focused on threats to the post-Cold-War order, like Russian muscle-flexing and the rise of the Islamic State. Asked about the risk of Greece's leaving the eurozone, and possibly even the European Union, Alexander R. Vershbow, deputy secretary general of NATO, said: ""This could have repercussions for us. We are worried about this."" The United States and NATO, he added, ""are not putting on blinders and seeing this as only an economic issue."" Since taking power in January, Greece's leftist government has played up the wider stakes involved in the debt crisis, a move that some dismiss as a negotiating tactic but that others see as an indication of the readiness of Syriza, the party of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, to tilt away from the West. ""Nowadays, the role of geopolitics is more important than before,"" the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, said in a recent speech at the University of Oxford in England. He accused the European Union of abandoning its ""culture of compromise"" and evolving ""into an empire in which the bureaucracy in Brussels, the financial markets and Berlin -- the so-called New Rome -- play a special role."" The European bloc, he added, must look beyond narrow financial calculations and at the bigger geopolitical picture. ""It needs to learn to see beyond the end of its nose, as we say in Greece,"" Mr. Kotzias said. François Lafond, the executive director of EuropaNova, a research group based in Paris, said that European countries were particularly concerned that failure to stabilize Greece could unleash a torrent of migrants, both Greeks and refugees from the Middle East who continue to flood into the country. Germany has consistently said that Greece and others must abide by European Union rules, and that exceptions in themselves fray the bloc's unity. But, seemingly to give herself some political cover, perhaps for a compromise, Ms. Merkel has left much of the haggling to her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble. She has also emphasized that Greece's troika of creditors -- the other eurozone countries, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank -- must sign off on any deal. If Greece eventually tumbles out of the eurozone, however, Ms. Merkel would suffer the blow, not only to her legacy, but also potentially to a range of other policies aimed at preventing the unraveling of European unity, so painstakingly assembled since 1945. Not least, without a new Greek deal, Ms. Merkel's leadership on sanctions against Russia, and on keeping Britain in the European Union, could also wobble significantly. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, made clear in an interview this week that Ms. Merkel had an eye on the geopolitical landscape. ""The chancellor is completely aware of the situation and the consequences, both politically speaking and economically speaking, of a Grexit,"" he said, referring to a Greek exit from the eurozone. ""I think the Germans now will push with us to find a compromise in the coming days if the Greeks decide to accelerate and work for a credible package,"" he added. But there is still no certainty of a deal this week that would allow the Europeans to release [euro]7.2 billion in credit to enable Greece to pay the International Monetary Fund the [euro]1.6 billion it owes by June 30. Even then, Ms. Merkel needs the German Parliament to approve a deal -- just as Mr. Tsipras needs the Greek legislature to do the same. Approval is not certain in either case. The stern line of Mr. Schäuble, Ms. Merkel's finance minister, reflects the skepticism of scores of deputies in the Christian Democratic bloc who will need to be brought on board for any deal. German and other European politicians feel they have been treated brusquely by Athens, whose harsh speech has forced European Union officials out of their usual mode of woolly compromise forged in closed-door debate. Norbert Röttgen, head of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament and a deputy for Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats, said, ""The whole way the Greek government has behaved has really damaged the mood"" in Berlin. Still, he expressed confidence that ""a large majority"" in the German Parliament would vote for a new Greek deal, if one could be reached, though amid much dissent. The geopolitical worries could tip that balance. Mr. Lafond, of EuropaNova, said such concerns had prodded even European leaders thoroughly fed up with what they see as the broken promises and histrionics of Greek negotiators to keep pushing for a deal to keep Greece in the eurozone. ""If it were not for the geopolitical context,"" Mr. Lafond said, ""they would have let them leave long ago.""

3591,433360167.xml,"      On a Tuesday afternoon two months ago, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down to a small lunch in President Bush's private dining room behind the Oval Office and delivered grim news to her boss: Their coalition against Iran was at risk of falling apart. A meeting she had attended in Berlin days earlier with European foreign ministers had been a disaster, she reported, according to participants in the discussion. Iran was neatly exploiting divisions among the Europeans and Russia, and speeding ahead with its enrichment of uranium. The president grimaced, one aide recalled, interpreting the look as one of exasperation ''that said, 'O.K., team, what's the answer?' ''  That body language touched off a closely held two-month effort to reach a drastically different strategy, one articulated two weeks later in a single sentence that Ms. Rice wrote in a private memorandum. It broached the idea that the United States end its nearly three-decade policy against direct talks with Iran. Mr. Bush's aides rarely describe policy debates in the Oval Office in much detail. But in recounting his decisions in this case, they appeared eager to portray him as determined to rebuild a fractured coalition still bearing scars from Iraq and find a way out of a negotiating dynamic that, as one aide said recently, ''the Iranians were winning.'' Mr. Bush gradually grew more comfortable with offering talks to a country that he considers the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, and whose president has advocated wiping Israel off the map. Mr. Bush's own early misgivings about the path he was considering came in a flurry of phone calls to Ms. Rice and to Stephen J. Hadley, his national security adviser, that often began with questions like ''What if the Iranians do this,'' gaming out loud a number of possible situations. Mr. Bush left open the option of scuttling the entire idea until early Wednesday morning, three senior officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were describing internal debates in the White House. He made the final decision only after telephone calls with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany led him to conclude that if Tehran refused to suspend its enrichment of uranium, or later dragged its feet, they would support an escalating series of sanctions against Iran at the United Nations that could lead to a confrontation. Even after Mr. Bush edited the statement that Ms. Rice was scheduled to read Wednesday before she flew to Vienna to encourage Europe and Russia to sign on to a final package of incentives for Iran -- and sanctions if it turns the offer down -- Ms. Rice wanted to check in one more time. She called Mr. Bush. Was he sure he was O.K. with his decision? ''Go do it,'' he was said to have responded. She did, but the results remain unclear. Iran has given no indication it will agree to Mr. Bush's threshold condition, suspending nuclear fuel production. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Friday that he would oppose ''any pressure to deprive our people from their right'' to pursue a peaceful nuclear program. The official news agency IRNA reported that Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Saturday that Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, was expected to arrive in Tehran in the next few days with the new package of incentives. ''Iran will examine the proposal and announce its opinion after that,'' Mr. Mottaki said. Mr. Bush's aides now acknowledge that the approach they had once publicly described as successfully ''isolating'' Iran was in fact viewed internally as going nowhere. Mr. Bush's search for a new option was driven, they say, by concern that the path he was on two months ago would inevitably force one of two potentially disastrous outcomes: an Iranian bomb, or an American attack on Iran's facilities. Conservatives, even some inside the administration, are worried that Mr. Bush may be forced into other concessions, including allowing Iran to continue some low level of nuclear fuel production. Others fear that the commitments Mr. Bush believes he extracted from Mr. Putin, Ms. Merkel and President Jacques Chirac of France may erode. But the story of how a president who rarely changes his mind did so in this case -- after refusing similar proposals on Iran four years ago -- illustrates the changed dynamic between the State Department and the White House in Mr. Bush's second term. When Colin L. Powell was secretary of state, the two buildings often seemed at war. But 18 months after Ms. Rice took over, her relationship with Mr. Bush has led to policies that one former adviser to Ms. Rice and Mr. Bush said ''he never would have allowed Colin to pursue.'' It is unclear how much dissent, if any, surrounded the decision, which appears to have been driven largely by the president, Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley, with other senior national security officials playing a more remote role. Both White House and State Department officials say Vice President Dick Cheney, long an opponent of proposals to engage Iran, agreed to this experiment. But it is unclear whether he is an enthusiast, or simply expects Iran to reject suspending enrichment -- clearing the way to sanctions that could test the Iranian government's ability to survive. After the surprise election of Mr. Ahmadinejad last summer, Iran ended its suspension of uranium enrichment, and the United States and Europe won resolutions at the International Atomic Energy Agency to move the issue to the United Nations Security Council. But it took weeks over the winter to get the weakest of Security Council actions -- a ''presidential statement.'' Russia, which has huge financial interests in Iran and is supplying it with nuclear reactors, was particularly reluctant to push the Iranians too hard. At a private dinner on March 6 at the Watergate with Ms. Rice, Mr. Hadley and Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Lavrov warned that Iran could do what North Korea did in 2003 -- throw out inspectors and abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. That would close the biggest window into Iran's program, making it hard to assess its bomb capability -- the same issue that had led to huge errors in Iraq. On March 30, Ms. Rice traveled to Berlin for what turned into a fractious meeting with representatives of the other four permanent members of the Security Council and Germany. She questioned what kind of sanctions would be effective. The conversation went nowhere. That led to Ms. Rice's warning to Mr. Bush over lunch, on April 4, that the momentum to confront Iran was disintegrating. Mr. Bush, one aide noted, was receiving special intelligence assessments every morning, some on Iran's intentions, others examining Mr. Ahmadinejad's personality, still others exploring how long it would take Iran to produce a bomb. On Easter weekend, Ms. Rice sat in her apartment and drafted a two-page proposal for a new strategy that pursued three tracks: the threat of ''coercive measures'' through the United Nations, negotiations with Iran that included what Ms. Rice has called ''bold'' incentives for Iran to give up the production of all nuclear fuel and a separate set of strategies for economic sanctions if the Security Council failed to act. They were accompanied by a calendar Ms. Rice had marked in three colors tracking the schedule for each of the three tracks, which Mr. Hadley told her was ''brilliant, colorful, and completely impenetrable.'' For the first time, her proposal also raised a question the administration had long avoided: Had the time arrived for the United States to play what she and Mr. Bush, both bridge players, called their biggest card -- offering to talk with Iran? She shared the proposal with Mr. Hadley, and then raised it with Mr. Bush in private on May 5  The idea intrigued Mr. Bush, White House officials say, and on May 8, Ms. Rice met with him just hours before flying to New York for a meeting with her European counterparts. She asked him what kind of body language to display at the United Nations meeting. Should she signal that the United States was considering negotiations with Iran? ''Be careful,'' he said, according to officials familiar with the conversation. ''I haven't made up my mind.''  That same day, an 18-page letter from Mr. Ahmadinejad arrived. It declared liberal democracy a failure, although it also was perceived by many as an effort to reach out and start a dialogue. Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley read the letter on the flight to New York, but dismissed it. ''It isn't addressing the issues we're dealing with in a concrete way,'' Ms. Rice said that day. Her meeting in New York with her European counterparts turned testy, particularly an exchange with Mr. Lavrov, who was still smarting from a speech by Mr. Cheney denouncing Russia for its increasingly authoritarian behavior. But the discussion, while fractious, convinced her that the only way to break the stalemate was to offer to join the negotiations. While Mr. Bush was intrigued, he was intent on secrecy, and so when the National Security Council met on the subject on May 17, he warned against leaks. The session was notable because Mr. Cheney, who had fought in the first term against engagement with Iran, said the offer might work, largely because it would force the choices back on Iran. And while the council had dismissed the letter, it used the meeting to discuss whether to respond. While Mr. Bush initially told Ms. Rice that others could work out the final negotiations, Ms. Rice told the president that ''only you can nail this down,'' apparently a reference to keeping Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin on board. Mr. Bush made the calls and got them to agree that if Iran resists, they will move ahead with a range of sanctions. But Mr. Bush, led by Ms. Rice, is taking a significant risk. He must hold together countries that bitterly broke with the United States three years ago on Iraq. And now, he seems acutely aware that part of his legacy may depend on his ability to prevent Iran from emerging as a nuclear power in the Middle East, without again resorting to military force.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was among the seven negotiators at a March 30 meeting in Berlin trying to address Iran's nuclear program. Ms. Rice's meeting with President Bush several days later eventually led to the White House reconsidering its decades-long ban on talks with Iran.

3484,1629536294.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDBERLIN -- The death of a Turkish-German student who tried to stop a young man from taunting two teenage girls has galvanized Germany at a time when its dealings with immigrants and its attempts to forge a more multicultural society are being intensely debated. In a chilling surveillance video posted online by the Bild Zeitung newspaper, the student, Tugce Albayrak, who had intervened to help the girls, can be seen becoming involved in an altercation with the young man in the parking lot of a McDonald's in Offenbach, a town near Frankfurt, in mid-November. Much is murky in the video, but a young woman with dark hair falls to the concrete ground of the parking lot, and then is still. Ms. Albayrak never regained consciousness, and her life support was switched off at her parents' request on Friday, her 23rd birthday. Whether Ms. Albayrak, who was studying at the University of Giessen to become a schoolteacher, died from a blow to her head by the youth, identified only as Sanel M., 18, or from her fall to the ground is not clear. Her family members, who will bury her Wednesday, have objected to the posting of the video, which the authorities say they are investigating. What is certain is that her fate has resonated because of heavy attention from conventional and social media, and also because Germany is immersed in discussion about how best to integrate non-Germans pouring in both as potential workers and as refugees fleeing war and hardship, from the Middle East to Africa. Although changing demographic patterns mean that foreign workers are critical to the continued success of Germany's economy, the immigrants are not always made to feel welcome. On Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted what her office billed as an ""integration summit,"" the seventh such meeting, and urged employers to ensure that immigrants and refugees received the same training opportunities as native Germans. A growing group of immigrant women, frequently from Turkey, are entering professional life, often as teachers and social workers, but also as journalists and politicians. That gave Ms. Albayrak's death resonance beyond the misfortune of a good Samaritan who sacrificed her life trying to protect others. The youth suspected of attacking her is in detention; the two girls she reportedly tried to protect came forward and testified to the police only late on Monday. President Joachim Gauck, a former East German pastor who has made a point of opening up his presidential palace to multicultural gatherings, wrote to Ms. Albayrak's parents this week. ""Like countless citizens, I am horrified and shaken by this terrible deed,"" he wrote. ""Our whole country is grieving with you."" An Internet petition calling for Ms. Albayrak to be awarded the country's highest civilian honor has garnered more than 158,000 signatures. Mr. Gauck would have to make a special exception to confer the award, which is not given posthumously. About 180,000 people have ""liked"" a Facebook page established by Ms. Albayrak's friends, which is headlined, ""Tugce showed civic courage; let us show her respect."" McDonald's paid for a full-page ad in Tuesday's editions of Bild. ""We grieve for an extraordinary woman, who showed civic courage and in doing so lost her life,"" the ad says, in German and Turkish. Correction:  December 10, 2014, Wednesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Wednesday about the death of a Turkish-German student who was killed when she tried to stop a man from harassing two girls, a case that has provoked debate over Germany's efforts to form a multicultural society, referred incorrectly to the student, Tugce Albayrak. Although of Turkish descent, Ms. Albayrak was born in Germany; she was not an immigrant. The error was repeated in the headline.

2487,433918368.xml,"      CORRECTION: An article last Sunday about the history of tension between Russia and Georgia misidentified the educational affiliation of an expert whose view of the motivation behind Putin-era foreign policy is similar to that of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. The expert, Stephen Cohen, is on the faculty of New York University; he is no longer with Princeton. The hostilities between Russia and Georgia that  erupted on Friday over the breakaway province of South Ossetia look, in retrospect, almost absurdly over-determined. For years, the Russians have claimed that  Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has been preparing to retake the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and have  warned that they would use force to block such a bid. Mr. Saakashvili, for his part, describes today's Russia as a belligerent power ruthlessly pressing at its borders, implacably hostile to democratic neighbors like Georgia and Ukraine. He  has thrown in his lot with the West, and has campaigned ardently for membership in NATO. Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's former president and current prime minister, has said  Russia could never accept a NATO presence in the Caucasus.   The border between Georgia and Russia, in short, has been the driest of tinder; the only question was where the fire would start.   It's scarcely clear yet how things will stand between the two when the smoke clears. But it's safe to say that while Russia has a massive advantage in firepower, Georgia, an open, free-market, more-or-less-democratic nation that  sees itself as a distant outpost of Europe, enjoys a decisive rhetorical and political edge. In recent conversations there,  President Saakashvili compared Georgia to Czechoslovakia in 1938, trusting the West to save it from a ravenous neighbor. ""If Georgia fails,"" he  said to me darkly two months ago, ""it will send a message to everyone that this path doesn't work.""   During a 10-day visit to Georgia in June, I heard the 1938 analogy again and again, as well as another to 1921, when Bolshevik troops crushed Georgia's thrilling, and brief, first experiment with liberal rule.    Georgians are a melodramatic people, and few more so than their hyperactive president; but they have good reason to fear the ambitions, and the wrath, of a rejuvenated Russia seeking to regain lost power. Indeed, a renascent and increasingly bellicose Russia is an ominous spectacle for the West too. While China preaches, and largely practices, the doctrine of ""peaceful rise,"" avoiding confrontation abroad in order to focus on development at home, Russia acts increasingly like an expansionist 19th-century power, pressing at its borders. Most strikingly, Russia has bluntly deployed its vast oil and gas resources to punish refractory neighbors like Ukraine, and reward compliant ones like Armenia.   A senior American official said that while the United States and Russia have common interests, Russia has become ""a revisionist and aggressive power,"" and the West ""has to be prepared to push back.""  But the Bush administration also recognizes that Russia has legitimate security interests, and that Mr. Saakashvili has played a dangerous game of baiting the Russian bear. Officials were laboring into the weekend -- in vain, they feared -- to coax both sides back to their corners. For much of the diplomatic and policy-making world, the border where Georgia faces Russia, with South Ossetia and Abkhazia between them, has become a new cold war frontier.   Georgia ardently aspires to join the peaceable kingdom of Europe; but to talk to Georgians about Russia is to enter a cold war time warp. I was speaking one evening to the owner of a fine antiques shop in Tbilisi when the conversation somehow swerved to Russia. ""These Russians are so stupid,"" he cried. ""They do not know what is friend. They would rather have angry enemies than real friends."" Russia's apparent hatred for Georgia provoked  endless bewilderment, and no little bit of pride. I heard from three different people about a poll in which Georgia had just surged ahead of the United States  as the country Russians identified as Enemy No. 1. Georgians insist that they are free of such zero-sum pathologies, though you might have thought otherwise if you had listened to the crowd in Betsy's Hotel in Tbilisi during the Russia-Holland quarterfinal of the Euro Cup; suddenly the Dutch were everyone's darling.     SUBMISSION AND REBELLION   The roots of this bitter relationship are deep and tangled, as is practically everything in the archaic world of the Caucasus. Modern Georgian history is a record of submission to superior Russian power. Threatened by the expanding Persian empire, in 1783 the Georgians formally accepted the protection of Russia; this polite fiction ended when Russia annexed Georgia in 1801. The chaos of the Russian Revolution finally gave Georgia a chance to restore its sovereignty a century later. The Georgians were Mensheviks -- social democrats, in effect -- and for three years  enjoyed one of the world's most progressive governments. The Bolshevik government signed a treaty respecting Georgia's independence -- which Europe, as President Saakashvili pointedly reminded me, naively insisted on taking at face value. By the time the Europeans woke up to reality,  it was too late.   From the time of Pushkin, Russians viewed Georgia as a romantic, exotic frontier. During the long puritanical deep-freeze of Communism, Georgia served as Russia's Italy -- a warm, lotus-eating sanctuary of singers and poets and swashbuckling gangsters. The elite had their beloved dachas on the Black Sea coast of Abkhazia. At the same time, Stalin, though himself Georgian, kept the republic  subdued through brutal purges. The head of the Georgian Communist party was Lavrenti  Beria, a cold-blooded killer who would become the master architect of Stalin's terror. The Georgians, though helpless, never accepted their Soviet identity, and preserved their language, culture, religious practice and sense of national identity, as they had under the czars. And when, at last, the Soviet empire collapsed as the czarist one had, Georgia immediately broke away and declared its independence, in 1991.    The infant country spent the next decade stagnating under the Soviet-style rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former foreign minister to Mikhail Gorbachev. But in 2003, Mr. Shevardnadze was peacefully overthrown in what came to be known as the Rose Revolution. Mr. Saakashvili was elected the following year. Since then, Georgia has become a poster child for Westernization.  The growth rate has reached 12 percent. The countryside remains impoverished, but what the outside world sees of Georgia is delightful. Tbilisi is a charming city, its ancient Orthodox churches restored to life, the lanes of the old city lined with cafes and art galleries. Mr. Saakashvili has also made Georgia one of the world's most -- or few -- pro-American countries. President Bush received a rapturous welcome when he visited in 2005, and the road to the airport has now been named after him, complete with a large poster of the president.      RUSSIA RESURGENT   It was, of course, at this very moment that another ambitious young figure was reshaping Russia's politics, economy and self-image. The combination of Vladimir Putin's reforms and the dizzying rise in the price of oil and gas have rapidly restored Russia to the status of world power. And Mr. Putin has harnessed that power in the service of aggressive nationalism.    Marshall Goldman, a leading Russia scholar, argues in a recent book that Mr. Putin has established a ""petrostate,"" in which oil and gas are strategically deployed as punishments, rewards and threats. The author  details the  lengths to which Mr. Putin has gone to retain control over the delivery of natural gas from Central Asia to the West. A proposed alternative pipeline would skirt Russia and run through Georgia, as an oil pipeline now does. ""If Georgia collapses in turmoil,"" Mr. Goldman notes, ""investors will not put up the money for a bypass pipeline."" And so, he concludes, Mr. Putin has done his best to destabilize the Saakashvili regime.   But economic considerations alone scarcely account for what appears to be an obsession with Georgia. The ""color revolutions"" that  swept across Ukraine, the Balkans and the Caucasus in the first years of the new century plainly unnerved Mr. Putin, who has denounced America's policy of   ""democracy promotion"" and stifled foreign organizations seeking to promote  human rights in Russia. Georgia, with its open embrace of the  West, thus represents a threat to the legitimacy of Russia's authoritarian model. And this  challenge is immensely compounded by Georgia's fervent aspiration to join NATO, one of Russia's red lines. Russian officials frequently recall that President Bill Clinton  promised Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not expand beyond Eastern Europe. Of course NATO is no longer an anti-Soviet alliance, and the fact that Russia views NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to its security is a vivid sign of the deep-rooted cold war mentality of Mr. Putin and his circle.   Still, they seem to mean it. Both Mr. Putin and his successor as president, Dmitri Medvedev,  have reserved their starkest rhetoric for this subject. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has threatened that Georgia's ambition to join NATO ""will lead to renewed bloodshed,"" adding, as if that weren't enough, ""we will do anything not to allow Georgia and Ukraine    to join NATO.""    After Mr. Saakashvili, then 37, became president, Mr. Putin made no attempt to court him,  and Mr. Saakashvili,  made a point of showing the regional hegemon no deference. The open struggle began in late 2005 and early 2006, when Russia imposed an embargo on Georgia's agricultural products, then on wine and mineral water -- virtually Georgia's entire export market. After Georgia very publicly and dramatically expelled Russian diplomats accused of espionage, Mr. Putin  cut off all land, sea, air and rail links to Georgia, as well as postal service. And then, for good measure, he cut off  natural gas supplies in the dead of winter.      ECHOES OF TRAGEDY   This new round of bellicosity struck Georgians as frighteningly familiar. Alexander Rondeli, the director of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies, recited to me a thought he attributed to the diplomat-scholar George F. Kennan: ""Russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals."" Here, for him, was further proof, as if it were needed, that imperialist expansion and brute subjugation are coded in Russia's DNA. The Georgian elite came to view Russia as an unappeasable power imbued with the paranoia of the K.G.B., from which Mr. Putin and his closest associates rose, and fueled by the national sense of humiliation over Russia's helplessness in the 1990s. ""You should understand,""  Mr. Saakashvili said, mocking the Europeans who urge forbearance on him, ""that the crocodile is hungry. Well, from the point of view of someone who wants to keep his own leg, that's hard to accept.""    And yet the crocodile might have been held at bay were it not for Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- the first a traditional Black Sea resort area that  defined Georgia's western frontier, and the second an impoverished, sparsely populated region that  borders Russia to the north. Georgia is a polygot nation, and views both regions as historically, and inextricably, Georgian. Each, however, had its own language, culture, timeless history and separatist aspirations. When the Soviet Union collapsed, both regions sought to separate themselves from Georgia in bloody conflicts -- South Ossetia in 1990-1, Abkhazia in 1992-4. Both wars ended with cease-fires that were negotiated by Russia and policed by peacekeeping forces under the aegis of the recently established Commonwealth of Independent States. Over time, the stalemates hardened into ""frozen conflicts,"" like that over Cyprus.    But the Georgians are intensely nationalistic, and viewed these de facto states on their border as an intolerable violation of sovereignty. Mr. Saakashvili cashed in on this deep sense of grievance, vowing to restore Georgia's ""territorial integrity."" Soon after taking office, he succeeded in regaining Georgian control over the southwestern province of Ajara. Then, in the summer of 2004, citing growing banditry and chaos, he sent Interior Ministry troops into South Ossetia. After a series of inconclusive clashes, the troops were forced to make a humiliating withdrawal.    Still, this violation of the status quo infuriated the Russians, and Mr.   Saakashvili, for once listening to his few dovish advisors, agreed to seek a negotiated settlement in Abkhazia. By late 2005, a Georgian mediator had initialed an agreement: Georgia would not  use force, and the Abkhaz would allow  the gradual return of 200,000-plus ethnic Georgians who had fled the  violence. But the agreement collapsed in early 2006, done in by hardliners  on both sides. This chapter has been all but effaced from the history one hears in Georgia.     WAITING FOR A SPARK   This brief interval of talk came to an abrupt end two summers ago,  when Mr. Saakashvili sent troops to retake the Kodori Valley in  Abkhazia -- in order, once again, to curb banditry (of which there was, in fact, a  great deal). Both the Abkhaz and the Russians took this as a sign that Georgia was prepared to fight to regain its former province. Indeed, last year Mr. Saakashvili traveled to  the Abkhaz border and promised a crowd of Georgian refugees that they would be back home within a year.   The breakaway regions were thus a stick of dynamite waiting to be lit. And  Mr. Putin struck a match. Although Russia, as the peacekeeping power,  was charged with preserving an international consensus that recognized Georgia's claims over Abkhazia, Russia lifted sanctions on Abkhazia last March. This had nothing to do with local events: Mr. Putin had tried for years to prevent Kosovo from declaring its independence from Serbia, and when the Kosovars went ahead, with strong American and European support, last  February, Mr. Putin responded by leveling a blow at America's Caucasus darling.   Soon afterward, the Russian Duma held hearings on recognition of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway republic in Moldova. Moscow argued that the West's logic on Kosovo should apply as well to these ethnic communities seeking  to free themselves from the control of a hostile state. And then, in mid-April, Mr. Putin held out the possibility of recognition for the breakaway republics.    Now things began to  degenerate rapidly. On April 21, Mr. Saakashvili called the Russian leader to demand that he reverse the decision. He reminded Mr. Putin that the West had taken Georgia's side in the dispute. And Mr. Putin, according to several of Mr. Saakashvili's associates, shot back with a suggestion about where they could put their statements.  Mr. Saakashvili, prudent for once, shied from uttering the exact wording,  but said that Mr. Putin had used ""extremely offensive language,"" and had repeated the expression several times.    Mr. Saakashvili was shaken by the naked hostility. He already feared that the West, or at least Europe, would never rally to Georgia's side in a crisis; and here was Mr. Putin saying that the West's support meant nothing to him. Here, indeed, was 1938.   The atmosphere during the early spring was electric with tension. Georgia accused Russia of shooting down a drone aircraft over Abkhazia; a United Nations report later confirmed the claim. Russia loudly insisted that Georgia was preparing for war; the Georgians had, indeed,  mobilized troops and prepared fuel dumps.    Russia responded to the apparent Georgian preparations by dispatching 400  paratroopers and  a battery of howitzers to a staging area not far from the cease-fire line, provoking a strong protest from NATO.  ""At the end of the day, we were very close to war"" on May 9, says Temuri Yacobashvili, the Georgian minister of reintegration and a Saakashvili confidant. In fact, diplomats in Georgia and elsewhere give somewhat more credence to the Russian claims than to Georgia's.  State Department officials urged Mr. Saakashvili to calm down. Perhaps each side was trying to provoke the other into striking first, and thus losing the battle of public opinion. Of course, that's how wars often start.    Until last week, it was Abkhazia, not South Ossetia, that seemed the likeliest candidate for a war of inadvertence, and so I visited there in late June.  It was hard to fathom what people were fighting over. In the capital, Sukhumi, population 40,000,  relics of the fighting were everywhere, and  the giant Soviet-era Parliament building was a scorched hulk. The streets were all but deserted.      THE SPIRAL DOWN   Talking to the Georgians about Abkhazia, and the Abkhaz about Georgia, was like shuttling between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Georgians said that they were ""always there,"" that Abkhazia was a Georgian kingdom, and that only by expelling the ethnic Georgians at the end of the war did the Abkhaz make themselves a majority in the province. The Abkhaz said that they are the descendants of a ""1,000-year-old kingdom,"" that they were the victims of a massive campaign of Russian deportation in the 1860s, and then that Stalin forced them into the Georgian yoke.  The Abkhaz talk about the Georgians pretty much the same way that the Georgians talk about the Russians. On that point, the Abkhaz share much with the South Ossetians. For them, as for the Ossetians, Georgia is the neighborhood bully.    It's a pretty safe bet that  Georgia and Abkhazia will not resolve their conflict  on their own. Both breakaway regions are quite willing to live with the Russian-enforced status quo, but even relatively moderate Georgian officials consider that status quo utterly unacceptable. When I asked Temuri Yacobashvili, a cultivated man who is one of the country's leading art patrons, why Georgia couldn't focus on the threat from Russia and let the Abkhaz have their de facto state, he said, ""These are not two different things, because it's not amputating hand, it's amputating head, or heart. No Georgian president could survive if he gave up on Abkhazia."" And, he added, ""if the international community by its inaction will not leave any other option for Georgia, then we have to make decision.""    If the West, that is, won't induce Russia to stop using the border region as a pawn, Georgia will be left with no choice save war. And how will the West do that? Mr. Saakashvili suggests sanctions, like  travel bans, on individual Russian leaders. When I posed the same question to Giga Bokeria, another confidante who is deputy minister for foreign affairs, he said, ""If Russia ceases to be an empire."" These are not serious answers.   The situation in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia took yet another turn down the spiral of confrontation in July, when mysterious acts of violence plagued both regions. There were bombings in Abkhazia.  There were shootings in South Ossetia. Who was behind the string of attacks? Criminal gangs? Provocateurs? Georgian secret agents? No one knew, but that didn't stop the accusations from flying. Abkhazia closed the cease-fire line,  then cut all ties with Georgia. On July 8, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about to visit Georgia, Russia sent fighter jets over South Ossetia.   Georgian Interior Ministry forces squared off against civilians in South Ossetia. The pot was boiling. And then, last week,  the lid blew in South Ossetia, for reasons that remain unclear.  Diplomats are now laboring mightily to prevent the war from spreading, though hostilities may serve too many different interests to be easily contained.   THE WEST GETS SCARED   There is real alarm in the West about the deteriorating situation in the Caucasus. Diplomats from Washington and the major European capitals, as well as from the United Nations, the European Union and NATO, have been crisscrossing the region trying to bring the parties together. In July, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister of Germany, the lead nation of the United Nations secretary general's ""Group of Friends"" of Georgia,  approached the Georgians and the Abkhaz with a peace plan similar in outline to the one that failed two years ago. The Georgians agreed to a meeting in Bonn; the Abkhaz, presumably with Russian support, refused. Mr. Saakashvili himself had tried to show a more conciliatory side, proposing guarantees of autonomy for Abkhazia within a federated Georgia, as well as the establishment of a jointly controlled free economic zone adjacent to the cease-fire line. (The Abkhaz rejected the offer, not only because they insist on independence, but because they assumed, perhaps correctly, that Mr. Saakashvili was posturing for the West.)   What is striking, though, is the growing consensus about Russian behavior. The United Nations,  the European Union and NATO have all sided with Georgia in the disputes over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Mr. Saakashvili was deeply disappointed when NATO declined in early April to put Georgia and Ukraine on the path to membership,  but he says that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel,  explained to him that while the Germans ""don't want to be pushed"" on NATO, they might offer their support later this year. Almost as satisfying to Mr. Saakashvili was his discovery that Ms. Merkel ""gets it"" about Russia -- ""because she knows Russia from her own experience.""   In a recent essay, the archrealist Henry Kissinger argued that Putin-era policy had been driven not by dreams of restored glory, but by ""a quest for a reliable strategic partner, with America being the preferred choice."" Some Russia experts on the left, like Stephen Cohen of Princeton, have taken a similar view. But Russia's bellicose behavior, and now the hostilities along its border, make it increasingly difficult to act on such a premise without seeming naive.   People of all political persuasion now seem to get it about Russia. In ""The Return of History and The End of Dreams,"" Robert Kagan, the neoconservative foreign policy expert who is advising John McCain, writes of Mr. Putin and his coterie: ""Their grand ambition is to undo the post-cold war settlement and to re-establish Russia as a dominant power in Eurasia.""  Michael McFaul, a Russia expert at Stanford who is advising Barack Obama, also views Russia as a premodern, sphere-of-influence power. He  attributes Russia's hostility to further NATO expansion less to geostrategic calculations than to what he says is Mr. Putin's cold war mentality. The essential Russian calculus, he says, is, ""Anything we can do to weaken the U.S. is good for Russia.""    For the West, the core issue is the survival of democratic, or at least independent, states along Russia's frontier. But for this very reason, even the United States, which has been  Georgia's most steadfast ally, distinguishes between the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on the one hand, and Russia's threat to Georgia's autonomy and integrity on the other.   HOPING FOR PATIENCE   Administration officials have regularly cautioned Mr. Saakashvili to be patient on Abkhazia and South Ossetia, even as they have given private and public reassurances about NATO membership. It would, in fact, be surprising if Georgia had consciously provoked a war in South Ossetia, since Mr. Saakashvili understands that doing so would almost certainly put an end to the NATO bid; indeed, Russia may well calculate that NATO will continue to exclude Georgia so long as the country is embroiled in hostilities along its border.    Georgia's predicament seems very simple from the vantage point of Tbilisi -- 1921, 1938 -- but extremely complicated from a great remove. Russia threatens Georgia, but Georgia threatens Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia looks like a crocodile to Georgia, but Georgia looks to Russia like thecats' paw of the West. One party has all the hard power it could want,  the other all the soft. And now, while the world was looking elsewhere, the frozen conflict between them has thawed and cracked. It will take a great deal of care and attention even to put things back to where they were before.

3544,1934952076.xml,"BERLIN -- The only televised debate between Chancellor Angela Merkel and her main challenger, Martin Schulz, before German elections later this month appeared not to sway many undecided voters on Sunday about who should be their next leader.Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Schulz clashed in the 97-minute exchange on refugee policy, Turkey and domestic security. She agreed with his statement that Turkey should not become a member of the European Union, while he expressed doubt about whether President Trump could deal effectively with North Korea's nuclear provocations.Polls released by Germany's public broadcasters afterward declared Mrs. Merkel the winner. But polls also have shown that many voters remain uncertain about who could better lead them over the next four years -- and there are three weeks to go before they cast their ballots on Sept. 24.A survey published last week showed that nearly half of all German voters, 46 percent, remained undecided. Winning their support will be crucial for each candidate.""Merkel Wins TV Duel,"" Bild, the mass-circulation newspaper, said in its digital edition, citing a poll by the public broadcaster ARD that showed 55 percent support for the chancellor, compared with 35 percent for her challenger.In Freiburg, where a group of residents had been invited to watch the debate, few appeared to be swayed.Anna Joos told the public broadcaster ZDF that she went in undecided, and saw and heard nothing in the exchange to move her in either direction.Walter Schneider echoed the lack of conviction about either candidate, telling ZDF, ""I don't see many big differences.""Another woman, Janina Welke, said: ""I think it confirmed many things that I already thought. There was nothing new.""Germany's political landscape thrives on consensus, and the two main parties have governed together for four years in a coalition led by Ms. Merkel and her center-right Christian Democratic Union. This was evident in the many instances during the debate that Mr. Schulz, of the center-left Social Democrats, agreed with the chancellor.For Mr. Schulz, who appeared to capture Germans' imagination after he announced his candidacy, sending support for his party to highs above 30 percent in February, the debate had largely been viewed as a chance to claw back that position. The Social Democrats have since dropped to around 24 percent.At the beginning of the debate, he appeared more willing to attack his rival, challenging her decision to throw open Germany's borders to nearly one million migrants in 2015. It was the start of 45 minutes centered on refugees and integration.But Mrs. Merkel stood steadfastly by her decision, even as she said a similar action would not happen again.Mr. Schulz later attacked President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, saying that he was trampling on international law and calling for an end to negotiations for Turkey to join the European Union.Germans have a long list of frustrations with Turkey, including the detention of 14 of its citizens on political charges and a vast crackdown by the Turkish government, which has purged around 150,000 public employees, including 4,000 judges and prosecutors.Mrs. Merkel agreed that Turkey should not become a member of the European bloc, saying that she would seek a joint position on this with other leaders from member nations. Her comments were likely to worsen Germany's long-running diplomatic feud with Turkey.Mr. Schulz also targeted Mr. Trump, calling him ""unpredictable,"" criticizing his habits on Twitter and questioning whether he would be capable of calming the situation over North Korea's nuclear tests.But his attacks appeared to give the chancellor the opportunity to play the role for which she is best known at home and abroad: a capable international leader. Mrs. Merkel insisted that despite the difficulties with Turkey, diplomatic relations should not be halted.The chancellor also said she would do ""everything in her power"" to keep the United States on a path of diplomacy in dealing with North Korea, even as she made clear that differences with the United States, Germany's strongest ally, would be called out.""Merkel played the head of government, who is out and about in the world,"" Süddeutsche Zeitung of Munich wrote in an editorial. ""Schulz played the friend next door, who would meet viewers at the bar. He was too tame, too stuffy, too conciliatory, too lacking in power-consciousness. He was not a challenger.""Chancellor Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz Faced Off in a Debate in Berlin On Sunday, Three Weeks Before German Elections.

1419,433558185.xml,"      No matter who wins the presidency of France on May 6, life in the grand, presidential Elysee Palace is destined to change. There is no future for the role of dutiful partner filled for the past dozen years by Bernadette Chirac, who as first lady has run charities, held dinners and served as a local official in the farming town of Correze. Both presidential candidates are members of unconventional couples. Segolene Royal, the Socialist Party candidate, is not married to the father of her four children, Francois Hollande. But more than that, they are political rivals. As head of the Socialist Party, he was nearly the candidate himself, and says he will try to run in 2012 if Ms. Royal loses this time. ''Certainly, without doubt,'' he said Wednesday in an interview on a train from Paris to Nantes. ''It's also a competition between us.'' He added that even if Ms. Royal won the election, he would not be joining her in Elysee Palace for her five-year term. ''I am not the one who is going to be elected,'' he said. ''If Segolene Royal wins, my situation doesn't change. It is Segolene Royal who has a great responsibility and has to decide what is the best way of exercising it -- including where she lives.'' This is not Bill-and-Hillary in 1992, when Bill Clinton told the American people they would be getting ''two for the price of one,'' pledging that Mrs. Clinton would be a full-time policy-making partner, and perhaps even a cabinet member, in his presidency. ''In France, you don't need two, you need one,'' Mr. Hollande said. ''My role is not to be a co-candidate with Segolene Royal. The candidate must be free and responsible. My role is to help the candidate -- but as party secretary, not my private capacity.'' Cecilia Sarkozy, 49, the wife of the front-runner and conservative candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy, has been largely absent from the campaign. Asked how she envisioned her life in 10 years, she replied, ''In the United States, jogging in Central Park.''  ''I don't see myself as a first lady,'' she said on a popular French television show. ''That bores me. I am not politically correct.'' Certainly there have been other instances in the 49-year history of the Fifth Republic in which presidential spouses -- and even presidents -- did not relish life in Elysee Palace. Presidents Georges Pompidou, Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Francois Mitterrand and their spouses kept their private residences and rarely stayed overnight in Elysee Palace. When the wife of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, Anne-Aymone, was asked early on what she wanted to do most as first lady, she replied, ''To no longer be one.''  But the role is shifting, from a long-suffering pillar of support to a symbol of independence, at a time when the private life of politicians has ever so slightly become part of politics in France. Mr. Hollande may have already suffered enough. He is the forgotten man of French presidential politics, the one who could have been a contender. Instead, he has been condemned to a small supporting role: crisscrossing the country to promote Ms. Royal. He plays the role several ways. He can be loyal and likeable, cool and conflicted, or simply bemused. He has been helped along the way by his natural charm and a sense of humor. Scanning an article titled ''Hollande's Calvary'' in the magazine Le Point, he smiled and said: ''If she wins, it's not a drama. It's not a comedy, either. It's a celebration! It's a success!''  Asked again about his ambitions for 2012, he said: ''There will be a competition. It could be Ms. Royal again. It could be others. It could be me.'' But he pulled back, adding: ''We are not there at the moment. We have to try to win 2007 before thinking about 2012.'' The Royal-Hollande relationship is, to say the least, complicated. The two have been together since they met in the late 1970s as students at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the finishing school for France's political elite. As deputies in Parliament, they have offices linked by a common door. Even though the two politicians officially share the same home address, they do not seem to coordinate their political messages. On Monday, the day after Ms. Royal came in second in the first round of the election and qualified for the runoff, Mr. Hollande ruled out any negotiations with Francois Bayrou, the centrist candidate who came in third. On the same day, Ms. Royal left a telephone message for Mr. Bayrou proposing a dialogue. The couple also clashed in January over tax policy, when Mr. Hollande proposed tax increases for workers earning more than $5,200 a month and Mr. Royal rejected the idea. Those differences help explain why Mr. Hollande says he would be neither Bill Clinton nor Joachim Sauer, the scientist-husband of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mr. Sauer was nicknamed Phantom of the Opera because for some time, he was only seen at his wife's side during performances of Wagner. ''I'm the third way!'' he joked. Mr. Hollande might have been the candidate instead of his partner. But the moment Ms. Royal announced that if the party wanted her, she was ready, she became a media star; he receded into the background. Their relationship is unclear. Repeatedly throughout the campaign, Ms. Royal has called herself a ''free woman.'' In an interview last year, she said bluntly, ''We are not a couple.''  Asked on Wednesday whether they were a couple, Mr. Hollande replied: ''It is not for us to either confirm or deny. Our lives belong to us.''  Ms. Royal has denied rumors that she and Mr. Hollande were living apart, saying in a book of her interviews published in March, ''Yes, we are still together, and yes, we still live together.''  Unlike Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Sarkozy has largely stayed away from the campaign trail, even though for much of Mr. Sarkozy's tenure as a cabinet minister, she worked side by side with him, managing his schedule, his strategy, even his diet. During the first round of balloting, however, Mrs. Sarkozy suddenly reappeared, accompanying her husband to the polling place. Mr. Sarkozy said in a recent interview with Le Figaro magazine that he intended to live in Elysee Palace if he were elected. Asked whether his wife would play the role of first lady, he skirted the question. ''You elect a candidate, not a family,'' he said. ''If I am elected, my wife will play a role. That's obvious. I was reproached for years for exposing my family. Now I am being asked why I don't expose it.''  In the last two weeks, the French media has gingerly raised the issue of whether Mrs. Sarkozy has left home, as she did in 2005 when she apparently went off with a prominent public relations executive, returning with a flurry of publicity. ''A wife leaving the marriage has far more serious consequences, both physical and psychological, than some extramarital affair,'' Daniel Schneidermann, the media columnist for the left-leaning newspaper Liberation, wrote last week. He was referring to the successful concealment for well over a decade of the existence of Mr. Mitterrand's daughter Mazarine, who was born out of wedlock. The columnist called on his fellow journalists to break the code of silence and ask the question that ''any American colleague would consider natural: 'Mr. Sarkozy, there are rumors that your wife has left home. What can you tell us about them?' ''  Asked whether the Sarkozys were no longer living together, Franck Louvrier, Mr. Sarkozy's spokesman, declined comment, saying in an e-mail message, ''That is a private matter.''  Francois Hollande, the father of the four children of Segolene Royal, says he will not move into the presidential palace if she wins the presidency on May 6. The wife of Ms. Royal's opponent is not enthusiastic, either. (Photo by Eric Feferberg/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images)(pg. A10)  ",2007-04-27
2430,1884700071.xml,"Hillary Clinton left no doubt on Thursday that she believes Russia contributed to her defeat by interfering in the election, condemning what she called Moscow's ""weaponization of information.""""I didn't fully understand how impactful that was,"" Mrs. Clinton said at a women's conference in New York. She said she was convinced that intrusions into Democratic Party leaders' emails were carried out by Russian hackers under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin and aided by so-called online trolls and social media bots to spread disinformation.""It is something that Putin has used inside Russia, outside Russia to great effect,"" Mrs. Clinton said, and she called for an independent investigation into Russian involvement.""I'm hopeful that the Congress will pull together and realize that because of the success the Kremlin feels it's had they're not going to go away,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""So whatever party you are, whatever business you run, whatever concerns you have, if we don't take action together to hold whoever was involved accountable, they will be back time and time again.""Mrs. Clinton made the remarks at the Women in the World conference in Manhattan, where she was interviewed by the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof before an audience of about 3,000 people. It was her first extensive interview since her loss in November to Donald J. Trump.She did not stint on criticism of the Trump White House. ""I don't take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning"" of the current administration, Mrs. Clinton said. ""Here's what I don't understand -- I don't understand the commitment to hurt so many people that this administration, this White House, seems to be pursuing.""Women in particular, she said, are under attack by Mr. Trump's policies.""The targeting of women -- which is what's going on -- is absolutely beyond any political agenda,"" Mrs. Clinton said, pointing in particular to the State Department's move to defund the United Nations Population Fund, among other programs.She criticized efforts to strip maternity care and other treatments from Republicans' failed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. ""They had not a clue what that meant,"" she said. ""I don't know if any of them had ever even read the bill.""She also noted that it was mostly men who were behind the push to curtail women's health benefits.""The things that come out of some of these men's mouths -- like, 'Why do we have to cover maternity care?""' she said with a laugh. ""Well I don't know, maybe you were dropped by immaculate conception?""She said Mr. Trump's two attempts at ordering travel bans aimed at people from a handful of predominantly Muslim countries had ""really sent a chilling effect across the world to not just Muslims, but to all kinds of people who said, 'Wait a second, don't you still have Lady Liberty in the New York Harbor?""'Mrs. Clinton, in an unvarnished dig at the president, noted that Mr. Putin ""shook my hand"" when they met, a reference to Mr. Trump's failure to shake the hand of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mrs. Clinton seemed to dismiss rumors that she would some day run for New York City mayor, saying that while she had a lot of work to do, ""I don't think that will include ever running for office again.""She was occupied, she said, with the unfinished business of the last century -- ""the rights and opportunities for women and girls.""""I think I have a lot to do,"" she said.She said she was puzzled by the fact that she was popular as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, according to polls at the time she left that job, but unpopular as a candidate.""Well, what happened?"" she said.

1677,1879350428.xml,"BRUSSELS -- They discussed Greece's bailout. They grappled with pension issues. They pored over draft budgets.But Monday's meeting of the Eurogroup, the 19 finance ministers from countries that share the euro, was most notable for what it did not address: the future of their president.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and current president of the Eurogroup, has been one of the public faces of austerity in Europe. He has been praised for helping lay the foundations for the region's economic recovery, but has been scorned for arguing in favor of fiscal restraint even as countries like Italy and Greece have struggled to overcome economic downturns.Now, his fate is in doubt after last week's election in the Netherlands. With his Dutch Labor Party recording a poor showing at the polls, he will probably lose his post as finance minister, meaning he will be replaced in the Eurogroup by the end of his term early next year.The fight to fill the impending vacancy is likely to kick off a wave of jockeying among member states. The head of the Eurogroup plays an intensely political role, setting the tone for a bloc of ministers that presses individual governments to shore up their finances and grants political approval for bailouts.Candidates are already being discussed, including Spain's center-right economy minister and a Socialist member of the Slovak government. But whatever minister prevails, Germany, the region's heavyweight economy, is still expected to dominate on issues like Greece's bailout and regional budgetary rigor.""Dijsselbloem has essentially been Germany's agent in the Eurogroup,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Mr. Dijsselbloem had been his country's finance minister for a matter of months when he took over as head of the Eurogroup in early 2013, and his tenure had a rocky start.An expert in agricultural economics who studied in Ireland and lives in the Dutch countryside, he incited controversy by endorsing a bailout of Cyprus that forced losses on many ordinary depositors.Though Mr. Dijsselbloem conceded that he made mistakes, and the Cypriot government agreed to a revised deal that put a greater burden on richer depositors, the stage was set for even tenser negotiations with Greece.By early 2015, Greece had been subject to years of tough austerity, and an increasing number of people were fed up with the seemingly never-ending belt-tightening measures sought by creditors. Thousands flocked to exuberant rallies against the country's lenders.In January of that year, Greeks voted in Syriza, a far-left party that campaigned on a broad pledge to roll back years of austerity measures, restoring cuts to salaries and pensions and securing a write-off of the country's huge debt burden. At the center of that effort was Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's combative finance minister.At a joint news conference with Mr. Dijsselbloem in Athens, Mr. Varoufakis flatly rejected working with the so-called troika -- the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank -- which had jointly demanded spending cuts and tax increases in exchange for loans.Those comments prompted a stony-faced Mr. Dijsselbloem to admonish his Greek counterpart for effectively seeking to derail the talks.Behind closed doors, the atmosphere was even worse. In one meeting of finance ministers in February 2015, the pair called each other liars and nearly came to blows, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of economic and financial affairs, told a French journalist.Then, after Mr. Varoufakis left a pivotal meeting in late June, the Eurogroup's finance ministers continued to confer. Mr. Dijsselbloem said the session would proceed ""without the Greek colleague,"" declining to even use his counterpart's name.The clashes between the two men inspired a Dutch rap video, and although Mr. Varoufakis was replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos in July 2015, he remained critical in his references to Mr. Dijsselbloem, writing in April 2016 that they were never going to have ""a beautiful friendship.""Ultimately, the Eurogroup failed to reach a deal with Greece, and it fell to national leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of Holland to negotiate an agreement. Athens was forced to create a 50 billion euro, or $53.6 billion, privatization fund to help pay down debt in exchange for an international bailout, its third since 2010.Mr. Dijsselbloem certainly presided over more than an unending series of crises.The eurozone has expanded under his watch, with Latvia and Lithuania joining in 2014 and 2015. Eurogroup meetings have also run far more smoothly than under his predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission, according to finance ministers and European officials.And since the European Central Bank introduced an effective backstop in 2012, buying bonds from eurozone countries with distressed economies, the Eurogroup has also allowed countries like France and Italy significant fiscal leeway.""Dijsselbloem is widely perceived as a good chair of the Eurogroup who has exercised a steady hand,"" said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels think tank.But Greece has loomed large over Mr. Dijsselbloem's tenure, and is likely to dominate his successor's priorities.The country's debt still stands at 180 percent of gross domestic product, and nearly a quarter of the population is unemployed. The prospects for economic recovery remain bleak. Fearful of the political uncertainty caused by seemingly unending bailout talks, foreign investors have been wary of putting money into Greece.More recently, Mr. Dijsselbloem has tried to forge a more equitable policy for the country, pushing for meaningful ways to ease its debt burden.

3674,1265763583.xml,"       SAY what you will about the euro zone's quarreling policy makers. They can claim at least one achievement during 2012: their common currency still has a heartbeat. A year ago, many people seriously doubted whether the euro would still exist by now. On the threshold of 2013, the debate is more about how long it will take for the euro zone economy to recover and what must be changed to avoid future crises. Europe still has plenty to worry about. Economic output is shrinking in nine of the 17 nations that use the euro. European banks remain weak, and many have yet to confront their problems decisively. Many businesses in Spain, Italy and other distressed countries cannot obtain credit, hampering a recovery. On top of that, with national elections coming in Italy in February and Germany in September, leaders there may be more focused on the narrow concerns of their voters than the cause of European unity. ""At the moment the crisis seems to have calmed down somewhat,"" Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper published on Sunday. ""But the underlying causes have by no means been eliminated."" But consider some of the doomsday situations that did not occur in 2012. Greece did not leave the euro zone or set off a financial disaster like the one sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Spanish and Italian bond yields, rather than succumbing to contagion from Greece, retreated from levels that had threatened their governments with bankruptcy. And nowhere did populist, anti-euro political parties gain the upper hand. All of these things could still happen, but the probability of catastrophe has fallen substantially because of a fundamental change in the way that European leaders are dealing with the crisis. Under its president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank has promised to buy the bonds of countries like Spain, if needed, to control their borrowing costs.  That vow, which cooled the crisis fever of late summer, bought time for elected officials to begin creating the superstructure needed to make the euro more credible, including a permanent fund for rescuing stricken member countries and a unified system for overseeing banks. ""In 2012, the euro area leaders finally got the diagnosis right,"" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""It wasn't about Greek debt or Irish banks. It was about some very fundamental design flaws that needed to be fixed. That's what markets were looking for."" Even though European political leaders seem to argue endlessly, they have made enough progress to keep speculators at bay. Investors surveyed by UBS recently ranked the chances of a breakup of the euro zone well behind the potential danger from a combination of spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in the United States next month or a hard landing by the Chinese economy. ""There is more of a perception that nobody is better off if this thing breaks up,"" said Richard Barwell, senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. The question in 2013 will be whether a fragile calm in Europe holds long enough for economic growth to resume, for banks to rebuild their balance sheets and for leaders to make progress creating a more durable currency union. Here are some of the main things to watch: ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE The euro crisis, arguably, will be over the day that all of the stricken countries are generating economic growth. Ireland, one of the first countries to get into debt trouble back in 2008, might already have turned the corner. Its gross domestic product grew 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the period a year earlier. Spain, Italy and Portugal are still deep in recession, and Greece is in a de facto depression. But there are some signs of progress in one crucial measure: trade balances. All of the distressed countries have increased exports this year and reduced trade deficits. That is a sign their products have become more competitive on world markets. The gains in competitiveness have come at the expense of working people, who had to accept lower wages. But the worst may be over. ""The hardest part of that adjustment has probably come to pass,"" economists at UBS said in a recent note to investors. Banks and European financial institutions still face an array of problems, including bad real estate loans in Spain and overexposure to the shipping industry in Germany. And despite a generous supply of cash from the European Central Bank, credit is scarce for businesses in Southern Europe. Europe probably cannot recover until the banking system is fixed, but that is taking a long time. In December, European leaders agreed to put the central bank in charge of supervising the 100 or so biggest banks in the euro zone, while also giving it the power to intervene in other banks if it sees fit. The central bank is expected to push banks harder to deal with problem loans and rebuild their cash reserves. But the central bank will not fully assume its regulatory duties until the beginning of 2014. And European leaders have not resolved another big problem: how to close down insolvent banks in a way that does not stick taxpayers with the bill. They also have been unable to agree on a deposit insurance plan for the euro zone that would protect consumers and help prevent bank runs. One result is that confidence in banks remains low, making it hard for them to raise money they can lend to their clients. According to the European Central Bank, almost all big banks in Europe are valued by the stock market at substantially less than the book value of their loans outstanding and other assets. ""It is really a very negative judgment by the stock market,"" Vítor Constâncio, the bank's vice president, said this month. POLITICS National elections in Italy in February and Germany in September could make it harder for leaders to agree to measures that could strengthen the euro zone but might be unpopular with voters, like stricter oversight of government spending. Mario Monti, the caretaker prime minister of Italy, said in recent days that he would not campaign for the top post but would agree to stay on if centrist parties asked him to. Investors and many European leaders would probably be happy to see Mr. Monti stay. He has helped Italy regain credibility abroad, lowering its borrowing costs, and he has taken steps to overhaul the economy. There is palpable nervousness about an attempted comeback by Silvio Berlusconi, a mercurial former prime minister, even if he is unlikely to regain his old job. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is very popular and the opposition is weak. But German voters are also grumpy about having to pay for bailouts of Greece and other countries. Until the election is behind her, Ms. Merkel may be reluctant to contribute more German money to hold together the euro. DEBT Greece still owes more money than it can repay, economists say. But the danger to financial markets of a default has receded because the debt is effectively out of circulation. Less than 20 percent of outstanding Greek bonds is in private hands, according to Goldman Sachs. The rest belongs to other euro zone governments or public sector institutions like the European Central Bank or International Monetary Fund. ""Since official-sector holdings are now predominant, it is political considerations -- rather than economic and financial dynamics -- that will determine whether Greece remains within the euro area,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients. In other words, Greece will stay in the euro zone as long as other members want it to. Spain also remains a concern because of the financial burden of rescuing its ailing banks. Political leaders and investors will be watching closely in coming months to see if Spain formally asks for support from the euro zone rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism.  If so, Spain would also qualify for support from the central bank, which would buy Spanish bonds if needed to help control the country's borrowing costs. FRANCE Tensions may be easing in much of the euro zone, but they are growing in France. The economy is at a standstill, and the government is perceived as hostile to business. That has many people worried. ""The real fundamental question is whether France will be able to restructure and make France strong and competitive again,"" Günter Verheugen, a former member of the European Commission, said at a conference in Warsaw this month. Still, Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute remains optimistic that the euro currency union will survive. Despite all the complaining about the cost, Europeans recoil at the alternative, Mr. Kirkegaard wrote recently. ""Most voters,"" he said, ""will not take a chance on a new drachma, lira or escudos.""

3593,2126758206.xml,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel has reigned as Germany's -- and often Europe's -- leading political power for 13 years. But within hours of her announcement on Monday that she would step down this year as leader of her conservative party, focus had shifted to who could possibly replace her.Ms. Merkel said she would not run again when the Christian Democrats elect a leader in December, relinquishing a post she has held since 2000. She said she planned to serve out her fourth term as chancellor, through 2021, but in light of strains within her party and its coalition partners, even many people within the party think she is unlikely to remain in power until then.
Whoever is elected to lead the Christian Democrats after Ms. Merkel would be well positioned to eventually succeed her as Germany's leader, as well, greatly raising the stakes in the December contest. As the power struggle shapes up, here are some of the potential candidates:
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer -- The ""Mini-Merkel""
Of all the possible successors, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, is the candidate who most resembles Ms. Merkel in her pragmatic, restrained governing style, earning her the moniker of ""mini-Merkel.""
Earlier this year, the Christian Democrats elected Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer party secretary-general -- the post Ms. Merkel once used as a steppingstone to the top position -- with a mandate to rejuvenate the party. She is expected to run for the party leadership in December.
The former governor of the tiny state of Saarland, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer is also believed to be the person the chancellor would most like to see succeed her, and the pair have shown that they can collaborate while maintaining separate political profiles. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose unwieldy last name is often shortened to her initials, A.K.K., enjoys support in the party's conservative ranks, where she is admired for her Roman Catholic family values, as well as from centrists.
Jens Spahn -- The Anti-Merkel
Ms. Merkel's health minister, Jens Spahn, is seen as one of the most vocal critics of the chancellor's 2015 refugee policy and is a darling of the party's conservative ranks. At 38, he would meet the demand from many members for a young leader to breathe new life into the Christian Democrats, in the style of Austria's Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who is 32.
In 2002, Mr. Spahn won a seat in Parliament, becoming its youngest member, and then earned a seat on the conservative party's governing board. He has made a name for himself by attacking the chancellor on laws approving dual citizenship and English-speaking staff working in cafes in the German capital. Since becoming health minister, he has taken on more serious issues, focusing on care for the sick and the frail.
Over the past year, Mr. Spahn has become friendly with the United States' ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who helped organize a meeting at the White House for the minister with John R. Bolton, President Trump's national security adviser, earlier this month.
Armin Laschet -- The Voice of Reason
A close ally of the chancellor, Armin Laschet has warned against shifting the party too far to the right, positioning himself as a voice of reason amid the recurring mutinies within Ms. Merkel's fractious coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and Bavarian conservatives.
Mr. Laschet, 57, is already a deputy party leader, and last year was elected leader of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, winning control from the Social Democrats.
Friedrich Merz -- The Banished Former Rival
Once a rival of Ms. Merkel, Friedrich Merz rose to prominence in the party alongside her, as an older group of leaders was toppled by a campaign finance scandal.
But he quit politics altogether after Ms. Merkel pushed him out as the head of the conservative group in Parliament in 2002.
Mr. Merz, now 62, went on to become head of Germany for BlackRock, which is generally considered the largest private fund manager, and a senior counsel in Düsseldorf at Mayer Brown, an international law firm.
The conservatives called him back into politics in 2014 to serve on an internal commission aimed at strengthening society. Last year, Mr. Laschet appointed him to a nonpaid position as Brexit commissioner for North-Rhine Westphalia.
The state is seeking to position itself as a relocation magnet for businesses that may leave Britain when it exits the European Union.

2345,433953933.xml,"      CORRECTION: An article on Monday about European efforts to shore up struggling banks omitted part of one sentence in some copies. The passage should have read, ''In Iceland, government officials and banking chiefs were discussing a possible rescue plan for the country's commercial banks.'' This article was reported by Carter Dougherty, Nelson Schwartz and Floyd Norris and written by Mr. Norris.    European nations scrambled on Sunday night to prevent a growing credit crisis from bringing down major banks and alarming savers as troubles in financial markets spread around the world, accelerating economic downturns on three continents.   The German government moved to guarantee all private savings accounts in the country on Sunday, hoping to reassure depositors who had grown nervous as efforts to bail out a large German lender and a major European financial company failed.   Late Sunday, it was disclosed  that new bailouts had been arranged for both of those companies, Hypo Real Estate, the German lender, and Fortis, a large banking and insurance company based in Belgium but active across much of the Continent.   The spreading worries came days after the United States Congress approved a $700 billion bailout package that officials had hoped would calm financial markets globally.    The moves came as federal regulators were trying to help resolve a merger fight in the United States that could make investors more uneasy. Court hearings were under way in New York on Sunday over competing efforts by Citigroup and Wells Fargo to acquire Wachovia, a large bank that nearly failed a week ago.      In Europe, meanwhile, the crisis appears to be the most serious one to face the Continent since a common currency, the euro, was created in 1999. Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel research group in Brussels, said Europe confronted ""our first real financial crisis, and it's not just any crisis. It's a big one.""   The European Central Bank has aggressively lent money to banks as the crisis has grown. It had  resisted lowering interest rates, but signaled on Thursday that it might cut rates soon. The extra money, aimed at ensuring that banks would have adequate access to cash, has not reassured savers or investors, and European stock markets have performed even worse than the American markets.   In Iceland, government officials and banking chiefs were discussing a possible rescue plan for the country's commercial banks. In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, appeared before television cameras to promise that all bank deposits would be protected, although it was not clear whether legislation would be needed to make that promise good.   Mindful of the rising public anger at the use of public money to buttress the business of high-earning bankers, Mrs. Merkel promised a day of reckoning for them as well. ""We are also saying that those who engaged in irresponsible behavior will be held responsible,"" she said. ""The government will ensure that. We owe it to taxpayers.""   Stock markets fell sharply in early trading on Monday in Asia on growing fears about the health of European banks and the resilience of the global economy.   The Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.4 percent in Tokyo on Monday, the Kospi index in Seoul fell 3.7 percent and the Standard and Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 index in Sydney declined 3.3 percent. The events in Berlin and Brussels underscored the failure of Europe's case-by-case approach to restoring confidence in the Continent's increasingly jittery banking sector. A European summit meeting Saturday did little to calm worries.    President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and his counterparts from Germany, Britain and Italy vowed to prevent a Lehman-like bankruptcy in Europe but they did not offer an American-style bailout package.   The crisis has underlined the difficulty of taking concerted action in Europe because its economies are far more integrated than its governing structures.   ""We are not a political federation,"" Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said. ""We do not have a federal budget.""   Last week, Ireland moved to guarantee both deposits and other liabilities at six major banks. There was grumbling in London and Berlin about the move giving those banks an unfair advantage. But Germany proposed its deposit guarantee Sunday after Britain raised its guarantee to $:50,000, or almost $90,000, from $:35,000.   Unlike in the United States, where deposits are fully guaranteed up to a limit of $250,000 -- a figure that was raised from $100,000 last week -- deposits in most European countries have been only partially guaranteed, sometimes by groups of banks rather than governments. In Germany, the first 90 percent of deposits up to 20,000 euros, or about $27,000, was guaranteed.   The Paris meeting produced a promise that European leaders would work together to halt the financial crisis and reassure nervous investors, but even before the meeting began it was becoming clear that two bailouts announced the week before had not succeeded and that a major Italian bank might be in trouble. That bank, Unicredit, announced plans on Sunday to raise as much as 6.6 billion euros, or $9 billion, in capital.    Fortis, which only a week ago received 11.2 billion euros from the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, was unable to continue its operations. On Friday, the Dutch government seized its operations in that country, and Sunday night the Belgian government helped to arrange for BNP-Paribas, the French bank, to take over what was left of the company.    In Berlin, the government arranged a week ago for major banks to lend 35 billion euros to Hypo, but that fell apart when the banks concluded that more money would be needed. Late Sunday, the government said a 50 billion euro package had been arranged, with the government and other banks participating.   The credit crisis began in the United States, a fact that has led European politicians to claim superiority for their country's financial systems, in contrast to what Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, called the ""speculative capitalism"" of the United States. On Saturday, Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, said the crisis ""has come from America,"" and Mr. Berlusconi bemoaned the lack of business ethics that had been exposed by the crisis.   Many of the European banks' problems have stemmed from bad loans in Europe, and Fortis got into trouble in part by borrowing money to make a major acquisition. But activities in the United States have played a role. Bankers said Sunday that the additional need for funds at Hypo came from newly discovered guarantees it had issued to back American municipal bonds that it had sold to investors.   The credit market worries came on top of heightening concerns about economic growth in Europe and the United States. Many economists think there are recessions in both areas, and one also appears to have started in Japan, where the Nikkei newspaper reported Monday that a poll of corporate executives found that 94 percent thought the country's economy was deteriorating.    ""Unless there is a material easing of credit conditions,"" said Bob Elliott of Bridgewater Associates, an American money management firm, after the retail sales figures were announced, ""it is unlikely that demand will turn around soon.""   Almost unnoticed as the United States Congress approved a $700 billion bailout for banks last week, it also agreed to guarantee $25 billion in loans for America's troubled automakers. European automakers said Sunday they would seek similar aid from the European Commission.   Henry M. Paulson Jr., the United States Treasury secretary, hoped that approval of the American bailout, which will involve buying securities from banks at more than their current market value, would free up credit by making cash available for banks to lend and by reassuring participants in the credit markets.   But that did not happen last week. Instead, credit grew more expensive and harder to get as investors became more skittish about buying commercial paper, essentially short-term loans to companies. Rates on such loans rose so fast that some feared the market could essentially close, leaving it to already-stressed banks to provide short-term corporate loans.   Altria, the parent company of the cigarette maker Philip Morris, said lenders wanted it to delay its planned $10.3 billion acquisition of UST, another tobacco maker, until 2009, but promised it would complete the deal.    Europe's need to scramble is in part the legacy of a decision to establish the euro, which 15 countries now use, but not follow up with a parallel system of cross-border regulation and oversight of private banks.   ""First we had economic integration, then we had monetary integration,"" said Sylvester Eijffinger, a member of the monetary expert panel advising the European parliament. ""But we never developed the parallel political and regulatory integration that would allow us to face a crisis like the one we are facing today,"" he added.   In Brussels, Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, agreed. ""Maybe they will be shocked into thinking more strategically instead of running behind events,"" he said. ""The later you come, the higher the bill.""   While the European Central Bank has power over interest rates and broader monetary policy, it was never granted parallel oversight of private banks, leaving that task to dozens of regulators across the Continent.   This patchwork system includes national central banks in each of the euro-zone's 15 members and they still retain broad powers within their own borders, further complicating any regional approach to problem-solving.   The European economic landscape today bears little resemblance to the 1990s, when the groundwork for the euro was laid. Back then, Mr. Pisani-Ferry recalled, few banks in Europe had cross-border operations on a significant scale.    A wave of mergers over the last decade created giants like HSBC and Deutsche Bank, which straddle continents and have major American exposure.   ""The European banking landscape was transformed fairly recently,"" Mr. Pisani-Ferry said. ""When the euro was first introduced, the question of cross-border regulation didn't really arise.""   Optimists say one potential long-term benefit from the current turmoil is that it often takes a crisis to propel European integration forward.   ""Progress in Europe is usually the result of a crisis,"" Mr. Eijffinger said. ""This could be one of those rare moments in E.U. history.""

487,1543330294.xml,"       A recent decision by European regulators to approve the merger of two cellphone companies in Germany will significantly reduce competition and encourage further consolidation in the industry.  The European Commission agreed on Wednesday to allow Telefónica to acquire E-Plus for [euro]8.6 billion, about $11.8 billion. The deal will reduce the number of cellphone networks in Germany to three. Telefónica agreed to abide by certain conditions, like selling 30 percent of its network capacity to companies that do not own their own networks and selling some of its spectrum and other assets, but the acquisition will undoubtedly lead to higher prices for German cellphone users. In approving the deal, Joaquín Almunia, the European Commission's vice president in charge of competition policy, appears to have succumbed to pressure from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Ms. Merkel has championed consolidation in the telecommunications industry, arguing that it would allow European firms to ""score internationally,"" presumably against companies from the United States and Asia. As recently as May, Mr. Almunia had publicly pushed back against Ms. Merkel's call for a more relaxed antitrust policy. Germany's competition regulator, the Federal Cartel Office, had  warned against the deal's risks last month.  There is clear evidence that telecom mergers have already hurt customers in Europe. In Austria, for example, prices for smartphone plans went up an average of 60 percent, according to Rewheel, a consulting firm, after a merger reduced the number of wireless companies in that country to three, from four. These companies always argue that acquisitions give them more resources to invest in new technologies and provide better service. But such claims are not backed up by experience. The result in almost all cases is less choice for consumers and higher prices over all.   ",2014-07-04
2801,1940379143.xml,"WÜRSELEN, Germany -- What happened to Martin Schulz?Mr. Schulz, 61, the candidate of Germany's Social Democratic Party, was once the only person who had a real chance of taking the chancellorship from Angela Merkel after nearly 12 years.He had left his job as president of the European Parliament to take her on. He won his party's backing in March with 100 percent support. Some early polls had him beating Ms. Merkel. The German news media called the sudden burst of enthusiasm the Schulz effect.Fast forward, just days from the Sept. 24 election, and that hype has fizzled. Ms. Merkel's party leads Mr. Schulz's Social Democrats 36 percent to 23 in the latest polls. No one gives him even an outside chance of winning.Many, even within his own party, say Mr. Schulz became a victim of overly inflated expectations and tactical missteps. But there has also been a larger problem for his party -- having its independent voice and identity subsumed after joining a coalition dominated by Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, or C.D.U.Four years of governing together with Ms. Merkel has left the Social Democratic Party, or S.P.D., in the awkward position of having to criticize the very government it is a part of. It is hard now to be a real opposition party.""The S.P.D. missed an opportunity to bring the politics of social democratic values against a C.D.U. that is not as conservative as it once was,"" said Prof. Emanuel Richter, political scientist at RWTH Aachen University, a research university.The one debate between Mr. Schulz and Ms. Merkel was widely criticized for its lack of actual debate. The roughly 16 million television viewers were instead treated to a polite exchange of policy ideas, plenty of nodding of heads and only very limited glimpses of daylight between the two candidates, let alone real friction.The press called the encounter a duet, rather than a duel.""Merkel was successful in not getting into a real election debate,"" said Tarik Abou-Chadi, a researcher at Humboldt University in Berlin, who studies electoral competition.When it comes to the last four years of their governing together, ""many of the good things that happened are being credited to the C.D.U.,"" Mr. Abou-Chadi said, referring to Ms. Merkel's party.But some of Mr. Schulz's problems are of his own making, analysts said.Having spent five years as president of the European Parliament and more than two decades working on broader European matters rather than specifically in German politics -- something once seen as a potential advantage for him -- Mr. Schulz has taken pains to shed the image of a globalist interloper and present himself as a man of the people.In many ways, he is. He likes to talk about his hometown, Würselen, a former coal-mining town north of Aachen, just miles from the Dutch and Belgium borders.He often mentions his neighbors, the local mosque, the bookstore he ran and the city hall, where at 31, he became the region's youngest mayor ever.For a time, it looked like a strategy that could work.Mr. Schulz's enthusiastic ""Bürgernähe,"" or closeness to the people, and his emphasis on social issues were seen as potential qualities that might expose chinks in Ms. Merkel's impressive armor.Unlike Ms. Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics, Mr. Schulz never graduated from high school, having dropped out to pursue a soccer career. He has made public a youthful period of being lost before learning the trade of book dealer and setting up his own little shop in Würselen that is now owned and still run by a woman he trained nearly three decades ago.At 19, he joined the Social Democrats and got into city politics. In his hometown, Mr. Schulz is remembered mostly fondly, whether for his time as a mayor or because of the relative fame his candidacy has brought.""In the 11 years he spent here, he dealt directly with the problems, the challenges and the lives of people here in Germany,"" Arno Nelles, Würselen's current mayor, said.According to a recent study, perhaps the only category in which Mr. Schulz outperforms Ms. Merkel is the perception that he is ""closer to the problems of people.""""Of course, Germany is a wealthy country, but not all people in our country are wealthy,"" Mr. Schulz said in the debate with Ms. Merkel, one of the few areas where he directly challenged her.But some analysts say Mr. Schulz should have put more emphasis on his tenure in the European Union post and less on his experience as a small-time mayor, nearly two decades ago.""You have this big politician who speaks five languages, but you keep on hearing about the mayor of Würselen,"" said Mr. Abou-Chadi of Humboldt University. ""He does do well with a certain class of people, but it's no longer enough.""Indeed, after the party's ephemeral success in polls early this year, the Social Democrats lost three state elections, most painfully in North Rhine-Westphalia, a bellwether state with a history of voting for Mr. Schulz's party.Although few fault Mr. Schulz for the results -- German state elections generally turn on regional issues -- the results did much to halt his momentum.""The Schulz effect was actually only visible in opinion polls,"" said Marcel Lewandowsky, a researcher at the Helmut Schmidt University-University of the Federal Armed Forces in Hamburg.While there was real early enthusiasm for Mr. Schulz when voters saw the possibility of an upset, as soon as that looked less likely, their attention drifted, Mr. Lewandowsky said.At the height of Mr. Schulz's appeal in March, Marcus Gross at INWT Statistics predicted that Mr. Schulz had a 30 percent chance of becoming chancellor. As the vote nears, Mr. Schulz is limping into the homestretch.""Right now the chance that S.P.D. beats the C.D.U., or that Martin Schulz becomes chancellor, is at less than 1 percent,"" Mr. Gross said.Mr. Richter, the political scientist at RWTH Aachen, noted that ""the S.P.D. is now polling exactly the same as it was before it nominated Martin Schulz.""""Twenty percent in the polls has really become normal for them,"" he said.That is a dangerous place to be for the country's main opposition party. But it reveals a narrowing of its traditional political terrain since the Social Democrats tacked toward the center in the late 1990s under their last chancellor, Gerhard Schröder.After nearly 12 years in office, Ms. Merkel has by now successfully co-opted much of the same space.While the personal popularity of Ms. Merkel, and Germany's economic progress under her, always made a victory by Mr. Schulz a long shot, some still wonder how his early momentum might have been preserved.""He might have been too slow in presenting his platform,"" ventured Georg Gauger, who at 20 is one of the youngest S.P.D. campaign directors in the country.But critics from the left say that, just days from the finish line, it was still hard to know what the party's candidate stands for.""They don't really know what they want,"" said Pascal Meiser, a parliamentary candidate for Die Linke, a leftist party.Last week, Mr. Schulz named the four conditions -- equal access to education, gender pay parity, secure and sufficient pensions and the protection of German and European values -- that he would insist on in coalition negotiations.He quickly had to quell the idea that he was opening the door for talks as a junior partner to Ms. Merkel yet again.He was still running for chancellor, he insisted. If Ms. Merkel wished to stay in the government, she should take a post as vice chancellor -- a role usually reserved for leaders of smaller coalition parties, he told disbelieving journalists.""Let the others win the opinion polls,"" Mr. Schulz said. ""I don't care, I'm fighting until the last second for every voter.""CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE   Follow Christopher F. Schuetze on Twitter @CFSchuetze.

2021,1916923014.xml,"HAMBURG, Germany -- For years the United States was the dominant force and set the agenda at the annual gathering of the leaders of the world's largest economies.But on Friday, when President Trump met with 19 other leaders at the Group of 20 conference, he found the United States isolated on everything from trade to climate change, and faced with the prospect of the group's issuing a statement on Saturday that lays bare how the United States stands alone.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the host of the meeting, opened it by acknowledging the differences between the United States and the rest of the countries. While ""compromise can only be found if we accommodate each other's views,"" she said, ""we can also say, we differ.""Ms. Merkel also pointed out that most of the countries supported the Paris accord on climate change, while Mr. Trump has abandoned it. ""It will be very interesting to see how we formulate the communiqué tomorrow and make clear that, of course, there are different opinions in this area because the United States of America regrettably"" wants to withdraw from the pact, she said.Mr. Trump seemed to relish his isolation. For him, the critical moment of Friday was his long meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, which seemed to mark the reset in relations that Mr. Trump has been desiring for some time. It also provided Mr. Putin the respect and importance he has long demanded as a global partner to Washington.Where previous American leaders saw their power as a benevolent force, and were intent on spreading prosperity through open markets and multilateral cooperation, Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as a nationalist, a unilateralist and a protectionist, eager to save American jobs.What recent events have underscored, though -- and especially at the G-20 -- is that no nation is today large or powerful enough to impose rules on everyone else. In advancing his views, Mr. Trump has alienated allies and made the United States seem like its own private island.Nowhere was Mr. Trump's isolation more evident than on the issue of trade.Mr. Trump thinks the United States has been unfairly disadvantaged by sweeping free-trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He believes the steel industry in particular has been savaged by globalization.Within days, he could impose restrictions and new tariffs on steel imports. Doing so would be a provocative move that could affect trade with more than a dozen major countries even while lifting the spirits of his most ardent supporters.The tariffs could very well provoke a global trade war.European officials here reacted astringently, threatening to retaliate. ""We will respond with countermeasures if need be, hoping that this is not actually necessary,"" the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said on Friday. ""We are prepared to take up arms if need be.""Targets could include American whiskey imports. ""I don't want to tell you in detail what we're doing,"" Mr. Juncker said. ""But what I would like to tell you is that within a few days -- we won't need two months for that -- we could react with countermeasures.""The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, warned that new protectionist trade measures could bring ""contagion"" that would slow the growth of the world economy. ""We cannot waste this moment of recovery, giving signals of protectionism or of incorrect trade behavior,"" he said.But as Mr. Trump contemplates protectionism, Europe and Japan reached a landmark free trade agreement this week. Mexico and China, two of the United States' largest trading partners, have been mulling their own deal. The world is moving ahead regardless.Mr. Trump and his economic team have been delaying the decision on steel in recent weeks because of disagreement among his advisers.For weeks, trade lawyers, industry leaders and members of Congress have been anxiously awaiting a recommendation on the matter from the Department of Commerce. They view Mr. Trump's decision as a moment that will illuminate whether he is ready to make good on his campaign promises to protect flagging American industries with tariffs.Among those most on edge are economists, many of whom have been uneasy about Mr. Trump's unorthodox views on trade because they have seen the damage from such actions before.The United States imported 30.1 million metric tons of steel last year, making it the world's largest steel importer, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada, Brazil and South Korea are the three biggest exporters to the United States, followed by Mexico and Turkey. China, the target of much anti-globalization rhetoric, is not such a major factor, at least not in steel.Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, worries that retaliation from China and Europe to any steel tariffs would be particularly painful for American exporters and could lead to job cuts when Mr. Trump is trying to bolster employment and labor force participation.While the steel industry, which Mr. Trump promised to revive, could benefit, other industries like construction and housing would probably suffer. Many of the workers in these industries and the consumers who buy their goods are likely to be the types of moderate-income voters who backed Mr. Trump.""It will hurt the people it's designed to help through higher prices,"" Mr. Strain said. ""Ultimately the economy will lose.""On Friday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, warned the Trump administration that new tariffs would face a challenge in the World Trade Organization. A similar challenge led to a rollback of tariffs imposed by President George W. Bush in 2002.""If global trade rules are not upheld, the E.U. will retaliate, but I cannot say now exactly how and when,"" Ms. Malmstrom said. ""We understand that the U.S. has concerns about overcapacity in China but we don't think this is the right way to go, as you cannot fight protectionism with protectionism,"" she added.But Mr. Trump has even contemplated pulling the United States out of the World Trade Organization itself.On climate, too, the United States -- just a year ago a leading voice in favor of global action to reduce carbon emissions -- is on its own path.Negotiators haggled late into Friday night over language declaring that 19 of the G-20 members consider the Paris accord ""irreversible,"" an effort to cast the United States as an outlier for jettisoning the pact while glossing over friction about the decision.But American officials were pressing language saying the United States would work with other nations to help them gain access to and use fossil fuels ""more cleanly and efficiently."" This suggestion met with stiff resistance from President Emmanuel Macron of France.Mr. Trump did little to paper over the disagreement, although his staff made sure that he did not have to listen to much criticism on climate change. His meeting with Mr. Putin was scheduled to begin just 15 minutes after the start of a G-20 working session on ""Sustainable Growth, Climate, and Energy,"" so he left after making a brief statement on the matter.Credit: STEVEN ERLANGER and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS; Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, Peter S.

2237,433303908.xml,"      With the World Cup opening June 9, Germany is in a familiar panic as the host country, fearing that its coach is merely a ''Baywatch'' blond, more concerned with his tan lines than with the bottom line of winning a global soccer championship. Since Jurgen Klinsmann, a former star forward and captain of Germany's national team, became the coach in July 2004, he has continued to live half of each month in Southern California with his American wife and two young children. This transcontinental commuting has aroused three of Germany's favorite preoccupations -- soccer, the United States and the weather.  A self-described cosmopolitan who speaks four languages, Klinsmann has hired an American trainer, as well as a sports psychologist, and has opened his roster to younger players. These reforms have unsettled the insular and conservative German soccer federation, which appears to want and fear change, said Oliver Bierhoff, the national team manager. Germany is split between those who embrace Klinsmann and those who vaguely fear an Americanization of German soccer, according to Andrei Markovits, a professor of German studies at the University of Michigan who has written about Klinsmann and anti-Americanism in Europe. The United States is still considered a soccer upstart here. In the view of some soccer officials, journalists and politicians, whatever New World approaches Klinsmann has learned in America have little application for an Old World soccer power like Germany. ''It's a clash between the new and the old in Germany,'' Markovits said by telephone. ''There is a real cleavage between the left, liberal, urbane, youngish Germany that really likes him and the 'real' guys who go to the bar every night and think he's the worst because he's sort of an intellectual, he lives in L.A. and brings in American methods and married an American wife.'' Particular dread set in March 1, when Italy routed Germany, 4-1, in an exhibition in Florence, Italy. Klinsmann was blamed for everything from poisoning German soccer to grinning too much to undermining the brittle economy. Speculation even arose that Klinsmann could be fired if Germany were to lose an exhibition to the United States on Wednesday in Dortmund. At the least, soccer officials fear that he will be booed for dropping a Dortmund-based defender, Christian Worns, from the national team. T-shirts exhorting ''You for us and we for you'' will be handed out to placate and rally the home fans. Criticism grew so intense by last week that Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, felt it necessary to deflate mounting pressure on Klinsmann. She declared that he was ''on the right track'' and urged him to ignore his critics. ''It's simply sad for a country that is going full speed to their biggest sporting event for the next 50 years,'' Klinsmann, 41, said here Sunday in an interview with a small group of international reporters. ''The World Cup is bigger than the Olympics,'' Klinsmann said. ''It's the biggest thing you can host. And it seems like we do everything possible to be far too skeptical, far too critical, instead of being happy and proud and honored that you have that competition.'' German reporters were not invited to the interview. It infuriates Klinsmann that he is portrayed by some as a beach bum. Apart from pledging to spend most of his time in Germany as the World Cup approaches, he has defiantly said he will stick to his plans ''no matter where home is.'' ''I take this job very seriously,'' he said, adding of the World Cup: ''If we win our first two games, everyone will try to jump on our train. But the train will have left already.''  Those unhappy with Klinsmann were surely unmoved by the latest rankings from FIFA, soccer's world governing body, which put the United States fifth, the highest it has ever been, and Germany 22nd, the lowest it has been. ''I think there is a lack of respect for our soccer,'' said Bruce Arena, the American national team coach. The United States threatened Germany before losing, 1-0, in the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup. Yet Arena said he still sensed a competitive jealousy among traditional powers who felt threatened by the rise of teams from North America, Africa and Asia. Germany's obsession with the weather, which has been particularly cold this winter, might influence the dissatisfaction with Klinsmann, said Peter Zygowski, a language consultant at the Goethe Institute in San Francisco. ''They are completely obsessed with sunshine and the beach, and when they hear about Klinsmann in California, it conjures images of vacation, slacking off,'' Zygowski said by telephone. That was certainly not his image as a rapacious goal scorer. Klinsmann scored 47 goals in 108 appearances with the German national team. He played forward for the team that won the 1990 World Cup and was the captain of the squad that won the 1996 European championship. After a professional club career in Germany, Italy, France and England, Klinsmann retired in 1998 and settled in Huntington Beach, Calif., to work in sports marketing and consulting. He prefers the privacy afforded him in the United States, believing that anonymity abroad will allow his son and daughter to grow beyond his considerable sporting shadow. The United States, he said, also appealed to him for its ''let's go for it'' attitude. Many Germans seem pleased by the new attacking style Klinsmann has put in. There was widespread agreement that change was necessary after Germany's embarrassing exit in the first round of the 2004 European championships, only two years after reaching the final of the World Cup. (It lost to Brazil. National team coaches face constant second-guessing in soccer-consumed nations. But Klinsmann's management style has been especially provocative: spending half of each month in California, communicating with his players via e-mail and telephone, following their club matches on satellite television. He would do the same thing if he lived in Berlin or Rome, Klinsmann said. But to some soccer officials, ''e-mail and PowerPoint is an American way of doing things,'' said Bierhoff, who is Klinsmann's second in charge. ''Every proposal seems suspicious,'' Bierhoff said. Germany's recent exhibition loss to Italy unleashed an angry response. ''Disaster,'' proclaimed the soccer magazine Kicker. The Bild tabloid, Germany's largest daily and one that has been highly critical of Klinsmann, wrote, ''Mama Mia We Are Bad.'' The tabloid showed a picture of a grinning Klinsmann (''Grinsi Klinsi'') and added, ''With you, one can only cry about our national team.'' Die Tageszeitung wrote that Klinsmann threatened the expected $9.5 billion economic windfall from the World Cup and sapped Germany of its anticipation and general optimism. ''Euphoria has been replaced by depression,'' the paper said, adding, ''At most, the gastronomy branch can hope that, out of desperation, the masses grab for the bottle.'' After that defeat, Klinsmann returned to California on the anniversary of his father's death, missing a workshop for World Cup coaches. That prompted a rebuke from Germany's greatest soccer hero, Franz Beckenbauer, who led West Germany to the 1974 World Cup title as the captain and to the 1990 World Cup title as the coach. ''Time is running out,'' Beckenbauer, who is president of the 2006 World Cup organizing committee, told reporters. Stefan Effenberg, a former teammate of Klinsmann's, urged that he be fired immediately, saying, ''The rest of the world is laughing at us.'' Some politicians even wanted Klinsmann censured before a sports subcommittee of the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, according to Markovits, the Michigan professor. ''That's like Larry Brown being cited before Congress for only bringing home a bronze from the Athens Olympics,'' Markovits said, referring to the Knicks' coach. ''Absurd.'' In recent days, the criticism has subsided, with Chancellor Merkel supporting Klinsmann and saying: ''We should not destroy our justified joy of anticipation with all this negativity. Do not let yourself be deterred from your path.'' Beckenbauer, too, offered encouragement, saying, ''There is no question that Germany can win the World Cup.'' But he also could not resist a dig at Klinsmann as they met in Berlin, telling reporters: ''It is fine that Jurgen will now stay in Germany. He has had enough of the sun.'' The German team does not have the skill of Brazil or Argentina, and the tactical sophistication of Italy, Klinsmann acknowledged. But he also noted that his team would enjoy a tremendous home-field advantage in the World Cup. ''The truth will be on the field,'' he said. If Germany wins the World Cup on July 9, Klinsmann will again be a national icon. If things go badly, Markovits said a German journalist recently suggested to him that Klinsmann would become persona non grata in his home country. ''Maybe he could visit his parents, but he would be completely vilified,'' Markovits said. ''I would seriously worry about his safety if the Germans lose in the quarterfinals.''

107,1840934022.xml,"       BERLIN -- In his strongest public comments since the election, President Obama on Thursday sharply criticized the spread of fake news online and said that President-elect Donald J. Trump would not remain in office for long if he failed to take the job seriously. Mr. Obama made his remarks at a news conference in Berlin beside the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, one of his closest allies on the Continent, calling the pair ""veterans"" of the international political stage. Ms. Merkel was unusually sentimental. ""It is hard to say goodbye,"" she said. But instead of basking in the glow of his valedictory tour of Europe, Mr. Obama used the moment to make a passionate and pointed attack on bogus news stories disseminated on Facebook and other social media platforms, twice calling such false reports a threat to democracy in his hourlong news conference. Mr. Obama also warned Mr. Trump of the need to take the job of the presidency seriously and to be tough on Russia. ""The extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States not just by its own people, but by people around the world -- that forces you to focus,"" Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump's ascent to the presidency. ""That demands seriousness."" ""And if you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long,"" Mr. Obama added. But it was on the subject of false information coursing through social media and television that Mr. Obama was most impassioned, so much so that at one stage he lost track of the question he was answering. ""Because in an age where there's so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television,"" Mr. Obama said. ""If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect."" ""I got all caught up in that one,"" he said. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, recently said fake news on the social network was rare, and dismissed notions that such reports might have swayed the election as ""pretty crazy."" But executives and employees at Facebook have been questioning if, or how, the social network helped influence the opinions and votes of Americans, according to interviews with current and former Facebook employees. Bogus news stories appearing online and on social media appear to have had a greater reach in the final months of the campaign than articles by authoritative, mainstream news outlets, according to an analysis of Facebook activity by BuzzFeed. In the three months before Election Day, the most popular stories produced by hoax sites and ""hyperpartisan blogs"" generated more engagement -- likes, shares and comments -- on Facebook than the most popular articles by major news websites, the analysis found. Among the 20 most popular fake election stories identified by BuzzFeed, all but three favored Mr. Trump or denigrated Hillary Clinton. Facebook and Google, which has also faced mounting criticism over distribution of fake stories on its platforms, said this week that they would take aim at the fake news sites' online sources of revenue. In Berlin, Mr. Obama pointed a second time to the potential dangers of false news reports. ""In the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened,"" he said in response to a question about the recent election. ""If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems."" Ms. Merkel offered her own warnings about the disruptions associated with digitization, likening the present period to the social disruptions that occurred during the Industrial Revolution. Germans have shown deep ambivalence toward social media, worried that global companies fail to respect the country's strict laws protecting personal privacy. Facebook has also come under scrutiny from the German government for allowing the spread of hate speech in postings that would be illegal in traditional media. The chancellor thanked Mr. Obama for putting ""personal privacy on the agenda,"" a nod to the strain in relations between the two after it emerged in 2013 that the National Security Agency had been monitoring Ms. Merkel's cellphone, prompting outrage among Germans. Mr. Obama urged Mr. Trump to cooperate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when the Russians behave, but said he hoped ""that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms."" ""And I don't expect that the president-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That will be something we'll learn more about as the president-elect puts his team together,"" he added. Mr. Trump has repeatedly complimented Mr. Putin and has sought to improve ties with Russia. The United States has accused Russia of hacking emails of Democratic Party officials in order to influence the election, and Mr. Putin warmly welcomed Mr. Trump's victory. Mr. Obama said he spoke to Mr. Trump last week about ensuring that his actions help to unify and not divide the country. ""And what I said to him was what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And he's indicated his understanding of that."" ""That has to reflect itself not only in the things he says but also in how he fills out his administration,"" Mr. Obama said, apparently referring to Mr. Trump's appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as a senior adviser. Mr. Bannon has been criticized for his association with racist, nationalistic and anti-Semitic views. ""My hope is that that's something he is thinking about,"" Mr. Obama added. ""Because not only is the president of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction, but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways."" Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump had reassured him that he would remain committed to the NATO alliance once in office, and that he was encouraged by that. Germans have been unsettled by many of Mr. Trump's campaign pledges, above all his questioning of America's commitment to NATO. West Germany relied on the alliance to protect it from the Soviets throughout the Cold War and many Eastern European countries now see it as their guarantee against a resurgent Russia. Yet the Europeans, including Germany, have failed consistently over the years to uphold their financial commitment to supporting the alliance, long a sore point with Washington. Germany has fallen short of its contributions over the past several years, and in 2015 made good on only about half its pledge, despite record tax income for the government. Ms. Merkel vowed that this would change in the future, crediting Mr. Obama with delivering the message that Germany needed to increase military spending. ""In the long term, the imbalance over defense spending cannot be maintained, and Germany has understood this message and already begun to react,"" Ms. Merkel said. Mr. Obama added that Germans should appreciate what the United States had done for the country since World War II. ""But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany,"" he said. ""Has looked out for Germany. Has provided security for Germany. Has helped rebuild Germany. And unify Germany."" Mr. Obama also said that if he were German, he would probably vote for Ms. Merkel, who may run next year for a fourth four-year term. ""I don't know whether that hurts or helps,"" he said with a smile. Mr. Obama arrived in Berlin on Wednesday night, and the two leaders had a private dinner. Mr. Obama spent much of Thursday morning waiting at his hotel for Ms. Merkel's schedule to clear. The two dined again Thursday evening and will meet Friday morning along with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Mr. Obama leaves for an Asian-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, early Friday afternoon.

820,1448199836.xml,"       BERLIN --  Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American security contractor granted temporary asylum by Russia, has appealed to Washington to stop treating him like a traitor for revealing that the United States has been eavesdropping on its allies, a German politician who met with Mr. Snowden said on Friday. Mr. Snowden made his appeal in a letter that was carried to Berlin by Hans-Christian Ströbele, a veteran member of the Green Party in the German Parliament. Mr. Ströbele said he and two journalists for German news outlets met with Mr. Snowden and a person described as his assistant -- probably his British aide, Sarah Harrison -- at an undisclosed location in or near Moscow on Thursday for almost three hours. Mr. Ströbele had gone to Moscow to explore whether Mr. Snowden could or would testify before a planned parliamentary inquiry into the eavesdropping. Any arrangements for Mr. Snowden to testify would require significant legal maneuvering, as it seemed unlikely that he would travel to Germany for fear of extradition to the United States. In his letter, Mr. Snowden, 30, also appealed for clemency. He said his disclosures about American intelligence activity at home and abroad, which he called ""systematic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act,"" have had positive effects. Yet ""my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defense,"" Mr. Snowden wrote. ""However, speaking the truth is not a crime. I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavior."" Mr. Ströbele, 74, is a seasoned left-wing defense lawyer and the longest-serving member of the parliamentary committee that oversees German intelligence. At a packed news conference after his return to Berlin, he said he was contacted about going to Moscow late last week after the German government said Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone might have been tapped by American intelligence agents. He declined to elaborate, but said he has had no dealings with the Russian authorities or the German Embassy in Moscow. He deftly parried requests to reveal more, while appealing to the governments and citizens of Germany, France and the United States to stop treating Mr. Snowden as a criminal. Instead, Mr. Ströbele said, echoing an opinion gaining support here, Germany should thank Mr. Snowden. After ARD, the premier German television network, reported on Thursday night about the Moscow visit, it broadcast a commentary arguing that Germany should show gratitude for his exposure of United States intelligence practices. Mr. Ströbele said he had found Mr. Snowden lucid and well informed. He said he had been told that Mr. Snowden was allowed to go shopping, but Mr. Ströbele declined to reveal any other details about Mr. Snowden's routine. News about the visit to Moscow eclipsed a number of interviews given on Thursday by the American ambassador, John B. Emerson, who tried to assuage German fears that the United States Embassy in Berlin was the center for monitoring Ms. Merkel and other well-placed Germans. Mr. Emerson, who arrived in Berlin two months ago and is a strong proponent of a landmark American and European trade deal under negotiation, was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry last week after Berlin's suspicions about eavesdropping on Ms. Merkel were made public. The action was unprecedented in post-World War II relations between the United States and Germany. Ms. Merkel, while palpably angry in appearances last week, has made no direct statements since, quietly sending two senior advisers to Washington this week to begin re-establishing the trust she said had been breached. Mr. Ströbele's news conference yielded moments of humor as well. At one point, his cellphone rang. He pulled it out, looked at it and asked cheerfully, ""Does anybody know the chancellor's number?"" Asked to speculate about which intelligence services might have monitored his trip to Moscow, he said with a smile, ""I assume that they are all interested.""

3037,1644570000.xml,"       BERLIN -- The foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine met here on Monday with their German and French counterparts in the latest attempt to ease the crisis in eastern Ukraine, where some 4,700 people have been killed since the conflict erupted last spring. Sounding weary but determined to pursue any chance of a diplomatic solution, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany said he had invited his colleagues for more talks because ""it would be wrong not to undertake this attempt at the beginning of a new year."" But he noted soberly that the situation in Ukraine remains ""extremely tense,"" with acute humanitarian needs, people continuing to die and still ""no way out."" Some four hours after talks began, Mr. Steinmeier announced that there would be more meetings at a lower level with a view to the foreign ministers gathering again next week. Only then, he indicated, would it be possible to contemplate a summit of top leaders from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, who could move the peace process significantly forward. President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine announced optimistically in late December that he would meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France on Thursday in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. But Ms. Merkel dampened expectations for the meeting last week, and neither she nor Mr. Hollande will travel to Astana without concrete indications that the impasse between Russia and Ukraine can be overcome. The deadlock concerns a 12-point accord that was reached in Minsk last September, calling for a truce and other steps toward peace. Ms. Merkel said last Thursday that the agreement must be carried out in full. While the shaky cease-fire has slowed the killing in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, the violence has not stopped, officials in Berlin noted, and the Russian and Ukrainian sides have yet to agree on demarcation lines, humanitarian aid deliveries or the removal of Russian fighters and weapons. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under Foreign Ministry rules, said that both Ukraine and Russia had raised new obstacles in recent days, revolving around whether Ukrainian officials would meet directly with representatives of the separatists. Those new obstacles, the officials said, had dimmed hopes for a breakthrough that might allow the Astana summit meeting to occur soon. Adding another complication, Interpol said on Monday that it had placed the former pro-Russian president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, on an international list of wanted fugitives, issuing what is known as a red notice. Mr. Yanukovych was driven from power by street protests and fled to Russia in February 2014. The current government of Ukraine wants to try Mr. Yanukovych and several of his former subordinates on embezzlement and other charges, but Russia is thought to be very unlikely to hand him over. Fighting between pro-Russian separatist rebels and government forces erupted in eastern Ukraine last spring, after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk issued declarations of independence from Ukraine.

3816,434311660.xml,"      WASHINGTON -- The Greek prime minister called on Monday for the United States and the European Union to crack down on speculative trading, arguing that exotic bets had driven up Greece's borrowing costs and threatened its effort to ease its debt crisis.   The prime minister, George A. Papandreou, said in an interview that he would not rule out turning to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. But he expressed hope that such aid, which would be unprecedented in the euro zone, would be unnecessary.    Also on Monday, the European Commission, which has been wary of I.M.F. involvement, endorsed a German proposal for a European monetary fund to head off future debt crises, though details remained vague. Any such plan would face political and legal impediments, and would arrive too late to help Greece even if all European Union members agreed to it, analysts said.    During a speech at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Papandreou outlined Greece's new austerity measures and spoke about the need for a global overhaul of financial regulations. Later on Monday, Mr. Papandreou met with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. On Tuesday, he is to meet with President Obama.   Mr. Papandreou said his recent meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France showed that ""there is a will for creating some ad hoc mechanism"" that would help the country borrow at reasonable costs.    While Greece successfully sold 5 billion euros in bonds last week, it has about 20 billion euros' worth of debt maturing in April and May.    ""We haven't asked for money,"" Mr. Papandreou said in the interview. ""We haven't asked for a bailout.""    Mr. Papandreou said the concept of a European monetary fund had merit. ""The more there is a European solution to a theoretical, but possible, problem in the markets, the less we will have to talk about an I.M.F. solution,"" he said.   But Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said it would not be easy to establish such a fund. ""It has to go through the whole ratification procedure,"" he said. ""Even in the simplest hypothesis it's not trivial.""    Impetus for the fund came from the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, who told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, in an interview published Sunday, that the countries that use the euro needed an institution with ""similar powers to intervene"" as the I.M.F.   The European Commission, the executive agency of the European Union, quickly endorsed the idea.    ""The commission is ready to propose such a European instrument for assistance, which would require the support of all euro-area member states,"" Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, a spokesman for the commission, told reporters in Brussels. ""Things are moving very quickly.""    Finance ministers will discuss the plan at their regular meeting next Monday.   The fund proposal, which Ms. Merkel has not yet formally endorsed, would be a shift for Germany, which has resisted providing assistance to countries that get in fiscal trouble because of unsound policies.    But German leaders have concluded that more cooperation is preferable to intervention by the  I.M.F. Although French officials appeared to be surprised by the speed of the proposal, they said they supported it in principle. (One unspoken reason might be the rivalry between Mr. Sarkozy and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F. chief and a former French finance minister.)   Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, said German leaders wanted to make sure that the Greek people understood what deep sacrifices would be needed.    ""They cannot get out of this without a very deep recession under the best of circumstances,"" Mr. Gros said. ""If they just start screaming when they see the dentist's drill, they are lost.""    Mr. Gros and Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, had proposed a fund with ability to lend money to ailing euro members or guarantee their bonds, as well as impose sanctions or cut off other forms of aid. If a government were in imminent danger of default, the fund would have the power to issue replacement debt. But it would impose a so-called haircut on investors, who would receive only a fraction of the government bonds' face value.    Mr. Papandreou used the first full day of his visit to the United States to attack traders who had driven up Greece's borrowing costs.    ""Despite the deep reforms we are making, traders and speculators have forced interest rates on Greek bonds to record highs,"" Mr. Papandreou said in his speech.    Mr. Papandreou, who took office in October, said Greece faced ""a credibility deficit as a result of the fabricated budget figures our predecessors had published.""    He described plans to sharply reduce the country's deficit, shrink public sector salaries, raise the retirement age and increase taxes. He vowed to curb tax evasion, saying that fewer than 5,000 Greeks declare annual incomes of 100,000 euros or more. And he promised to crack down on corruption and increase transparency.   Mr. Papandreou also called for patience. ""Countries are not like financial markets,"" he said. ""Social change cannot be executed as swiftly as credit-default swaps. You cannot sell short on social commitments and practical responsibilities.""   Credit-default swaps were also largely blamed for the financial crisis that swept the world in 2008.   Mrs. Clinton, at a news briefing with Mr. Papandreou, called for tighter regulation of ""these financial instruments that have been used to the detriment not only of Greece but of other countries, including our own.""   Also on Monday, Mario Draghi, the chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a group of global regulators, said there was ""a strong uneasiness"" about ""the sense that bets can be placed on any institution, be it government, be it a company.""

398,238069710.xml,"      BERLIN -- For Chancellor Angela Merkel, selling the German public on the country's nearly $30 billion share of the bailout deal for Greece may prove even harder than her part in negotiating the financial rescue package.   German taxpayers, most of whom oppose any kind of bailout, were dragged unwillingly into helping their southern neighbor. Mrs. Merkel, whose cabinet approved the deal on Monday, now faces two tests that will determine how successful she has been in selling it: a vote on the bailout in Parliament on Friday, and an election on Sunday in Germany's most populous state.    While analysts say they believe that Mrs. Merkel's governing coalition will deliver the necessary votes to get the bailout bill through Parliament this week, the outcome of the vote in the state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is anything but decided. A loss there would deliver a significant setback to her party and stand as a stark rebuke to her second term in office.   The urgency was evident in Mrs. Merkel's television blitz on Monday, with a news conference in the afternoon and appearances on three stations in the evening.    ""If she's taking such drastic measures, it means that she fears that if she can't anchor her version that it will cause real damage,"" said Oskar Niedermayer, professor of political sociology at the Free University in Berlin. ""It's still unclear at the moment which view of the Greek crisis will win the upper hand in the minds of the public.""    Mrs. Merkel hopes to convince voters that she took the necessary steps to ensure the stability of the euro, and hence the German economy. Mrs. Merkel and top officials from her conservative Christian Democratic Union have worked hard to head off the view that the bailout is nothing more than a giveaway to the Greeks, with other indebted countries like Portugal and Spain forming a line behind them.   ""It does not just mean that we help Greece, but that we stabilize the euro as a whole, which helps people in Germany,"" Mrs. Merkel said at the news conference on Monday in Berlin. She called the bill ""a last resort"" and ""an emergency situation,"" portraying it as a necessary evil.    Up to two-thirds of Germany's people have said in opinion surveys that they oppose a bailout, which according to the draft legislation would send $11.2 billion to Greece this year, in the form of guaranteed loans through the state development bank.    The opposition runs deep. The bitter German news coverage of Greek tax dodging and early retirement touched a nerve here. German workers have long accepted stagnant wages and shrinking pensions to stay competitive in the global economy.   ""If Germany had to go through that, why shouldn't other countries as well?"" said Ian Stewart, chief economist for Deloitte in Britain. ""The German public is not happy about the bailout, but I think that's understandable. The German economy has been through the mill. It has had to cope with loss of competitiveness and has done so very successfully.""   On Sunday, in an interview in Germany's largest-circulation newspaper, Bild, Mrs. Merkel contended that the loans to Greece might not cost taxpayers a cent, and could even make money for the government if the Greek government paid them back as planned.   In a continent awash in debt, Germany has the most fiscal flexibility among European Union members to help Greece, and as Europe's largest economy, it has historically been the leader on economic matters, including the establishment of the euro. In other European capitals, Mrs. Merkel was criticized for slowing down measures to help Greece in recent months, and raising the cost of the bailout as a result.    The question for Mrs. Merkel has been one of political will in the face of public discontent and threats of a constitutional challenge over breaking the monetary union's no-bailout clause.   The latest opinion surveys show that the election in North Rhine-Westphalia, a western rust belt state, is too close to call. And it is far from a referendum on Greece, with the state's voters weighing a campaign-finance scandal that has damaged the Christian Democrats there, as well as issues like education and health care policy.    ""The federal government is anything but popular for its financial and social policies,"" said Timo Grunden, a political scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in the state. But he said the Greek bailout's effect would be muted by the fact that the main opposition parties all supported measures to stabilize Greece's finances, even if they disagreed over the exact methods.    Right now, Mrs. Merkel's party appears set to lose at least seven percentage points compared with the last election, in 2005, when the Christian Democrats won nearly 45 percent of the vote. In an interview on the N24 television news station on Monday, the interviewer asked Mrs. Merkel whether she believed that her party would be punished in the election for the Greek bailout.    ""I believe that the people know that one does what one has to do,"" she said.   Credit: NICHOLAS KULISH; Stefan Pauly contributed reporting from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

2132,896508748.xml,"      BERLIN -- The European Central Bank increased aid to cash-strapped financial institutions Thursday, but disappointed those expecting more drastic measures to combat slowing growth and address a deepening bank emergency.   The E.C.B.'s restraint came in contrast to the action of the Bank of England, which announced another round of bond buying to support the slowing British economy. The pound fell against all major currencies after the announcement; the euro rose against the dollar.   As a slump in German factory orders provided the latest sign of a looming recession, the E.C.B. left its benchmark rate unchanged, at 1.5 percent. The Bank of England also left its main rate unchanged, at 0.5 percent.   During his last news conference as E.C.B. president, Jean-Claude Trichet said that members of the central bank's governing council had discussed a rate cut before concluding ""by consensus"" that inflation in the euro area -- at 3 percent -- was still too high. The statement, and a subdued assessment of the euro zone economy, suggested the bank will be open to cutting rates in coming months, as many analysts expect.   Mr. Trichet said the central bank expected ""very moderate"" growth ahead in ""an environment of particularly high uncertainty.""   Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC, wrote in a note to clients that the E.C.B. ""has clearly left the door open to a cut, possibly as soon as November."" She said that Mr. Trichet may have been reluctant to send any stronger signals on E.C.B. intentions that might constrain his successor, Mario Draghi, now governor of the bank of Italy. Mr. Draghi will take office Nov. 1.   Mr. Draghi brings a similar outlook and background as Mr. Trichet and is not expected to radically alter monetary policy. But he may find it hard to move boldly at the beginning of his term, given that he may feel it necessary to establish his anti-inflation credentials. He has kept an extraordinarily low profile in the final months of Mr. Trichet's tenure and his intentions are largely a mystery.   The E.C.B. did respond to signs that banks are reluctant to lend to each other because of fears about their exposure to shaky government debt.   Those fears were intensified by the woes of the French-Belgian bank Dexia, which is seeking its second taxpayer-financed bailout in three years and said Thursday that it was close to selling its Luxembourg unit.   The central bank will spend  40 billion, or $53.6 billion, in the coming year buying so-called covered bonds, a form of debt secured by payments received on assets like packages of loans.   Covered bonds are one of the main ways that European banks raise money. The E.C.B. also bought covered bonds in 2009 to alleviate the bank financing squeeze that followed the collapse of the U.S. investment firm Lehman Brothers in 2008.   The E.C.B. measure, however, was dwarfed by the Bank of England's plans to widen its so-called quantitative easing program to $:275 billion from $:200 billion.   ""Vulnerabilities associated with the indebtedness of some euro area sovereigns and banks have resulted in severe strains in bank funding markets and financial markets more generally,"" the Bank of England's governor, Mervyn A. King, wrote in a letter to the British Treasury explaining the bank's decision.   The E.C.B. does not have the power to save ailing banks like Dexia or address deeper problems in the banking system, officials insist, caused by banks' exposure to sovereign debt and reserves that are too thin to absorb potential losses. That task belongs to governments.   Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, suggested Thursday that Europe was moving closer to a coordinated effort to bolster European banks and address the longer-term problems.   While cautioning that more expert advice was needed, she said, ""If the conditions are there we shouldn't hesitate."" Mrs. Merkel appeared at a news conference in Berlin that also included Christine Lagarde, president of the International Monetary Fund, and Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank.   Her comments were similar to what she said Wednesday during a visit to Brussels and in line with remarks made Thursday by Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.   A coordinated bank recapitalization is ""not only obvious but indispensable,"" Mr. Barroso said in Brussels. ""I don't think anyone in Europe is opposed to coordination in such a sensitive area.""   But he declined to put any figure on the euro zone's bank recapitalization needs or to say whether he would propose the use of the euro zone's common bailout fund to help with the task.   The E.C.B. also said it would resume offering banks unlimited loans at the benchmark interest rate for about one year. Previously the maximum loan term was six months. Banks must put up collateral like bonds or other securities, but otherwise are allowed to borrow as much as they want.   Mr. Trichet said the E.C.B. would continue the unlimited lending ""for as long as needed"" and at least through mid-2012.   Separately, the Dutch parliament voted Thursday to extend the powers of the euro zone's rescue fund, leaving Slovakia and Malta as the last two euro zone members whose legislatures have yet to approve the program.   While calling on European leaders to implement an expanded bailout fund for Greece and other countries with severe debt problems, Mr. Trichet sought to dash hopes that the E.C.B. could be used as a vehicle to leverage borrowing by the fund, and increase its firepower. Analysts like Daniel Gros at the Center for European Policy Studies have suggested that the bailout fund register as a bank so that it could borrow from the E.C.B.   The British move came about a month earlier than some economists had expected but was no surprise.   The Bank of England's rate-setting committee had hinted last month that it might have to inject more money into financial markets to support an increasingly threatened economic recovery.   The decision shows that ""they believe an already difficult outlook for the economy has deteriorated,"" said Howard Archer, chief economist for Britain and the euro zone at IHS Global Insight.   Many economists have argued that the E.C.B. erred when it raised rates twice this year, most recently in July.   A bigger-than-expected drop in German factory orders in August, according to data released Thursday, provided the latest evidence that the euro zone economy is headed for a downturn caused by severe austerity programs in countries like Spain, as well as the uncertainty created by the European government debt crisis.   Recent figures showed inflation in the euro zone rose to an estimated 3 percent in September, well above the E.C.B. target of about 2 percent. Hard liners on the governing council are likely to have argued that the E.C.B. would violate its mandate to preserve price stability if it cut rates now.   The E.C.B. governing council, in one of its occasional forays from Frankfurt, met at the Berlin offices of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, which remains Europe's bastion of price stability.   Finland's prime minister, Jyrki Katainen, who was visiting the European Commission, underlined how such proposals for bank recapitalization are likely to encounter opposition.   The first step, he said, was for national governments to encourage their banks to raise capital from the financial markets. Failing that, ""the government is responsible for recapitalization,"" he added.   The European Banking Authority, which coordinates national regulators, is reviewing the results of the last banking stress tests, which took place in July, in light of the slump in the value of Greek and other bonds.   The value of the tests has been called into question by Dexia, which passed easily because those tests did not have to take into account the market valuation of holdings of Greek debt. The banking authority underlined in a statement that it had not announced new tests.   So far the E.C.B. has followed a more conservative course than the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of England. The E.C.B. has bought government bonds in an effort to hold down borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy, but has avoided the wholesale asset purchases made by its peers.   With governments struggling just to approve a relatively modest aid package for Greece, the E.C.B. may eventually be faced with a choice of letting the country fail -- an event that could threaten the whole euro zone -- or making huge bond purchases even though such a move would enrage many north Europeans and split the governing council.   Like their European peers, British leaders are under mounting pressure to act amid criticism from some economists and lawmakers for holding on to far-reaching spending cuts that were introduced before the recent economic slowdown.   Prime Minister David Cameron has been adamant that he was sticking to his austerity plan, but he acknowledged Wednesday that the economic slowdown was worse than he had expected. The government suggested this week that it could sell government bonds to finance loans for struggling companies.   The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that Britain's economic output rose 0.1 percent from the first quarter, half the 0.2 percent it had said earlier. The I.M.F. last month cut its growth forecast for Britain for this year to 1.1 percent from 1.5 percent.   Consumers have started to curb spending, feeling squeezed by rising prices and unchanged salaries.   Julia Werdigier reported from London. Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels.

3300,433726406.xml,"      Germany's second most powerful politician, Vice Chancellor Franz Muntefering, announced Tuesday that he would resign from office. His departure is likely to destabilize the already shaky power-sharing coalition between the country's two biggest parties. The announcement that Mr. Muntefering would step down to care for his ailing wife, who he said last week had her fifth cancer operation, surprised the nation. While Mr. Muntefering insisted in a news conference that the move was based entirely on ''personal and private'' motivations, he is leaving at a time of growing dysfunction in both the coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel and his own party.   Mr. Muntefering helped form that coalition of traditional rivals of the center-left and center-right parties in negotiations after the close election here two years ago. Since that time he has often seemed like the glue that held it together, a stalwart of his left-wing Social Democratic Party but at the same time a confidant and trusted adviser to the conservative Mrs. Merkel. That has been an increasingly difficult balance to strike as Mr. Muntefering's party has shifted back toward its traditional base among voters on the left. That in turn has meant trying to roll back economic reforms made under the former chancellor -- and fellow Social Democrat -- Gerhard Schroder, reforms that Mr. Muntefering helped enact and had recently tried to defend. His departure will test Mrs. Merkel's strength as a leader and consensus builder. While she remains very popular, with approval ratings hovering around 70 percent, her successes have only encouraged her coalition partners to differentiate themselves by challenging her policies that much more. After Mr. Muntefering's announcement, the Social Democrats  chose Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier as his successor as vice chancellor. Olaf Scholz, a leading member of Parliament from the party, will take over Mr. Muntefering's other post as labor and social affairs minister. In contrast to Mr. Muntefering, Mr. Steinmeier has been sharply critical of Mrs. Merkel on foreign policy recently. He is considered a possible challenger for chancellor in future elections. ''You have a new one coming who doesn't get along as well with Angela Merkel,'' said Jurgen Falter, a professor of political science at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz. ''That's going to make the work in the cabinet more difficult.'' Speaking on German television, Mrs. Merkel thanked Mr. Muntefering. ''There are situations in life which are more important than politics,'' said a somber Mrs. Merkel. ''I wish Franz Muntefering and his wife all the best. It is a pity that we cannot continue to work together.'' Mr. Muntefering, 67, was one of the most experienced leaders in the Social Democratic Party, but also one of the last of his generation in such a high political position. As labor minister, he tried to steer a reformist path. The price for the reforms he and Mr. Schroder fought for, however, was disillusionment among disgruntled trade unionists and other traditional Social Democrat voters, who joined with elements of the former Communist Party of East Germany to establish the new Left Party. With the Left Party seizing the populist ground and the Christian Democratic Union led by Mrs. Merkel increasingly centrist in its approach, the Social Democratic Party ''has found itself caught between two hard rocks,'' said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who now works as a banker in Berlin. In a bid to fend off growing support for the Left Party -- it now has over 10 percent of the vote, according to the latest opinion polls -- and to stop the Sicial Democratic Party's  further decline, the leader, Kurt Beck, shifted course to the left. Although Germany is enjoying its lowest level of unemployment in 14 years, there have been calls to use the fruits of the country's economic revival to restore some of the social safety net cut back by Mr. Schroder. Mr. Muntefering lost a very public battle with Mr. Beck over increasing social benefits for unemployed people over 50 years old. Some leading conservatives and opposition leaders said this month that the coalition had already run its course, after conservatives and Social Democrats failed to reach agreement on several issues, including disputes over the privatization of the federal railways and the introduction of a minimum wage. ''In some ways the campaign for the next federal election has already started,'' said Gero Neugebauer, a political science professor at the Free University in Berlin. ''Don't expect any more reforms. The conservatives and Social Democrats will now start staking out their positions and identifying the election issues.'' With two years remaining before the scheduled parliamentary elections, Mr. Muntefering's exit raised the prospect of deeper fissures within the government, or even early elections, if the deadlock between the parties worsened further. Opinion polls show that the public is  disenchanted with the coalition, with 55 percent saying it should be abandoned.

3927,1539223085.xml,"       LONDON --  Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, recently described by a former adviser to his Conservative Party as ""a sphinx without a riddle,"" has set himself up for a highly public failure this week, as other European leaders look set to ignore his strident opposition and select an old Brussels hand, Jean-Claude Juncker, as the next head of the powerful European Commission. It will be a defeat for Mr. Cameron on numerous levels, leaving him at risk of looking weak at home and isolated abroad, and leading many to question his diplomatic skills and judgment. Yet seen from the hothouse of British politics, where Mr. Cameron is fighting the anti-Europe wing of his own party and the anti-Brussels populism of the U.K. Independence Party with national elections next May, his stance is less perplexing. Principled opposition to an appointment of a Brussels retread at odds with his government's hopes of negotiating a new relationship with the European Union may be better for Mr. Cameron than submitting passively to what many in Europe view as a power grab by the European Parliament. ""I will go on thinking it is wrong right up until the end,"" Mr. Cameron said last week. His aides say that he will force his fellow leaders to vote on Mr. Juncker at this week's European Union summit meeting, a provocative step at a gathering where decisions are usually reached by consensus after bargaining. The summit is to start in Ypres, Belgium, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting in World War I, just ahead of the 100th anniversary of the start of the conflict, in what was meant to be a symbol of European reconciliation. If he forces a vote on Mr. Juncker, Mr. Cameron will not endear himself to the other leaders, especially not to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose help Mr. Cameron will still need if he is to succeed in changing Britain's relationship with the European Union. If re-elected next year, Mr. Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the bloc. The predicament with Mr. Juncker, a European federalist who would replace José Manuel Barroso, is another reminder of the power of European Union institutions, the momentum of existing bureaucracy and, these days, the indispensability of Germany, without whose support nothing important happens in Brussels. But it is also a response, Mr. Juncker's supporters argue, to the perceived ""democratic deficit"" of the European Union. Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, is the candidate of the center-right parties in the European Parliament, which promoted the idea during last month's European elections that the winning party would also capture the presidency. In the past, national leaders have selected the commission president. To a great degree the dilemma is Mr. Cameron's fault, even though it was Ms. Merkel, no fan of Mr. Juncker, who had promised Mr. Cameron that the commission presidency would go to someone else. Ms. Merkel then found that for her own domestic political reasons, caught in her own coalition with the Social Democrats, she could not follow through on her vow.  Ms. Merkel has found it difficult to go against a German consensus that the choice of Mr. Juncker represents a democratic vote, even as Mr. Cameron argued that Mr. Juncker appeared on no Pan-European ballot and that the national leaders should not forfeit their right to choose. Still, even the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, a friend to the British, said Sunday, ""The rules of democracy are that the largest party gets the top job."" Jan Techau, a German who is the director of Carnegie Europe, a research group, said Mr. Cameron's ""reform agenda for Europe is, by and large, the right one, and most people would agree with it."" But Mr. Cameron's approach has two flaws, Mr. Techau said. ""He tries to leverage British power to get results, often in a clumsy way,"" and he believes that Britain can achieve a far-reaching economic overhaul of the European Union, including a more vibrant single market, ""without the political framework and integration to support it,"" he said. Mr. Cameron ""is right to point out the parliamentary power grab,"" Mr. Techau said. ""But he did it in a do-or-die way -- my way or the highway -- that is fundamentally un-European."" The European Parliament, the only European institution elected in a Pan-European vote, claims a higher democratic legitimacy and wants more power. It is dominated by the center-right and the center-left. The current Parliament president, Martin Schulz of Germany, a Social Democrat, had the idea that the largest bloc to emerge from last month's European parliamentary elections should, as in most national parliaments, have the right to name a candidate for president of the commission, the powerful European Union bureaucracy. Mr. Schulz, the candidate of his center-left bloc, thought he would win, but in fact the center-right, known as the group of the European People's Party, did. And it had grudgingly agreed on Mr. Juncker, 59. Ms. Merkel, whose party is at the heart of the European People's Party, went along, apparently judging that it all could be resolved later. While national leaders always chose the commission president in horse trading for other important jobs, under new rules the Parliament must confirm the choice. So Mr. Schulz and the Parliament insisted that the national leaders would have to endorse the democratic decision of the European voters and pick the candidate of the leading bloc -- Mr. Juncker. But Mr. Cameron's problems started sooner. A supporter of Britain remaining in the European Union, his efforts to manage fierce euro-skepticism within his own Conservative Party have led to risky compromises, most importantly the promise of the referendum. He will want to argue -- as Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Britain did in 1975, the time of the last such referendum -- that Britain had gained a better deal from the bloc. Mr. Wilson won his bet handily; it's not clear that Mr. Cameron would be able to pull off the same outcome. But it was an earlier decision that haunts Mr. Cameron. As a sop to the euro-skeptics in his party, he pulled the Conservatives out of the European People's Party group, infuriating Ms. Merkel, and put them into a smaller one. So Mr. Cameron, who might have quashed Mr. Juncker's candidacy early on, had no standing to do so. As the British press, always happy to remind readers of World War II, features cartoons and satirical asides about the Nazi Luftwaffe and its ""Juncker"" bombers, Mr. Cameron travels to Ypres to argue that a vote for Mr. Juncker will help euro-skeptics and make a British exit from the European Union more likely. Whatever the ""Tory Brownie points"" Mr. Cameron gets, The Sunday Times of London said, ""the outcome is, however, a defeat,"" and Mr. Juncker ""will be seen by voters as a block on Mr. Cameron's E.U. strategy.""

1891,520625535.xml,"      BERLIN -- In a landmark ruling that will make it easier for people to allow relatives and other loved ones to die, Germany's highest court ruled Friday that it was not a criminal offense to cut off life-sustaining treatment for a patient.   The court overturned the conviction of a lawyer who last year was found guilty of attempted manslaughter for advising a client to sever  the intravenous feeding tube that was keeping her mother alive,  although in a persistent vegetative state. The mother had told her daughter that she did not wish to be kept alive artificially.    The verdict is likely to spur significant changes in the practice of assisted suicide and is certain to restart the debate over euthanasia and the right to die in Germany.    In its decision, the court clearly distinguished between ""killing with the aim of terminating life"" and an action that  ""let a patient die with his or her own consent.""    The ruling strengthens an individual's right to die with dignity, since terminating life-sustaining treatments will no longer be a crime if patients have declared their wishes.   The lawyer, Wolfgang Putz, an expert in patient rights at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, called the decision ""outstanding.""    ""It protects against abuse and it sets down clear boundaries,"" Mr. Putz said in a telephone interview on Friday after the verdict. ""It helps the patients and it helps the doctors.  It takes away at last the fear of punishment.""   There has been a growing debate in Europe over assisted suicide, particularly in Britain. In February, a British filmmaker, Ray Gosling, was arrested after he admitted that he had helped kill a former lover. Euthanasia with the consent of the patient -- sometimes called voluntary euthanasia -- is legal in some European countries, including Belgium and Switzerland.    For years, Germans have traveled to Switzerland to die. But it is an especially difficult issue here because the Nazis used the term euthanasia as cover for a mass extermination program of disabled people.    ""The verdict transmits a fatal signal that does not comply with the  critically sick people's fundamental right to self-determination and care,"" said Eugen Brysch, the director of the German Hospice Foundation, in a statement on Friday. Mr. Brysch took exception, in particular, to the fact that the woman, Erika Kullmer, expressed her wish orally rather than in writing.    ""If, as in this case, a casual private conversation without sufficient witnesses is enough to determine the patient's wishes, then the floodgates for misuse are wide open,"" Mr. Brysch said.   But Germany's justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, applauded the decision by the high court in Karlsruhe.    ""In a difficult phase of life, wills by patients provide safety for patients, relatives, doctors and nurses,"" Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said. ""The will freely formulated by a human being must be respected in all circumstances of life.""   In the case before the court,  Ms. Kullmer was in a persistent vegetative state for five years after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage in 2002. Although she   had expressed the wish not to be kept alive under such circumstances, the management at her nursing home had refused to let her die.   The lawyer for Ms. Kullmer's  children, Mr. Putz, advised them to cut the tube in 2007, which the daughter did. The patient died of heart failure two weeks later.   In 2009, a district court in  Fulda gave the lawyer  a suspended sentence of nine months for attempted homicide. The daughter was acquitted.   ""For me it was always clear that I have done the right thing,"" Elke Gloor, Ms. Kullmer's daughter, told the German news agency DPA after the hearing.    Germany's conservative chancellor, Angela Merkel, declared in 2008 that she was ""absolutely against any form of assisted suicide, in whatever guise it comes.""    Those comments were made in the wake of a scandal after a German campaigner for assisted suicide, Roger Kusch, helped Bettina Schardt, a retired X-ray technician from the Bavarian city of Wurzburg, kill herself at home even though she was not sick or dying; she simply had not wanted to move into a nursing home.    Rudolf Henke, the chairman of the Marburger Bund, the German doctors' association, said in a statement that the acquittal of Mr. Putz should not be seen as ""a license for independent action while making decisions on the continuation of life-sustaining measures.""   ""Before life-sustaining measures are stopped, legal regulations must determine what kind of action is required to reflect the will of the patient,"" Mr. Henke said. ""The killing of people remains prohibited.""     Credit: VICTOR HOMOLA and NICHOLAS KULISH; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris.  ",2010-06-26
1844,1543582522.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  When President Obama placed a call to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany last Thursday, he had a busy agenda: to consult with a close ally and to mobilize wavering Europeans to put more pressure on Russia to end its covert incursions in Ukraine.  What Mr. Obama did not know was that a day earlier, a young German intelligence operative had been arrested and had admitted that he had been passing secrets to the Central Intelligence Agency.  While Ms. Merkel chose not to raise the issue during the call, the fact that the president was kept in the dark about the blown spying operation at a particularly delicate moment in American relations with Germany has led frustrated White House officials to question who in the C.I.A.'s chain of command was aware of the case -- and why that information did not make it to the Oval Office before the call. The details of this spying case remain murky. Intelligence officials have declined to comment, and it is still not clear what the German operative has told the authorities.  But the episode sheds light on the tensions that arise from the colliding cultures of spycraft and statecraft -- one driven by the need to vacuum as much secret material as possible; the other giving primacy to diplomatic objectives. It also reinforces the problem that surfaced a year ago in the wake of revelations about National Security Agency surveillance practices from the rogue contractor Edward J. Snowden: whether the costs of spying on close allies outweigh the gains.  At the White House, senior officials have expressed concern that the latest allegations could set back relations with Germany just as Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel are struggling to move past the distrust generated by the Snowden disclosures, including the revelation that the N.S.A. had tapped Ms. Merkel's cellphone. What is particularly baffling to these officials is that the C.I.A. did not inform the White House that its agent -- a 31-year-old employee of Germany's federal intelligence service, the BND -- had been compromised, given his arrest the day before the two leaders spoke. According to German news media reports, the agency may have been aware three weeks before the arrest that the German authorities were monitoring the man.  A central question, one American official said, is how high the information about the agent went in the C.I.A.'s command -- whether it was bottled up at the level of the station chief in Berlin or transmitted to senior officials, including the director, John O. Brennan, who is responsible for briefing the White House. For all his concerns, Mr. Obama does not plan any extraordinary outreach to Ms. Merkel, an official said, noting that some in the administration also feel that Germany should not overreact to the case or conflate it with the privacy issues raised by the N.S.A.'s surveillance.  Some experts say the recent tensions betray a lack of attention in Washington to its relationship with Berlin. ""Bush and especially Obama have treated it as a 'solved problem' requiring no further American involvement,"" said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany. ""Recent events have demonstrated that just the opposite is the case. Germany is still deeply conflicted about itself and about the world around it."" The White House and the C.I.A. both declined to comment on the case, with a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Caitlin M. Hayden, saying, ""We're certainly not going to discuss who knew what and when in regards to the allegations.""  On Tuesday, the chairwoman and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in separate interviews that Mr. Brennan had briefed them about the matter, but they refused to divulge any details of the conversations.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the committee, expressed concern about the damage that could come to American-German relations. ""We need to relook at this whole situation, how we handle our allies,"" said Ms. Feinstein, who said she met with German Parliament members who she said were ""very upset"" by the reports. The ranking Republican, Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, sounded a note of caution about the allegations. ""I'm not sure how much of it is true,"" he said. ""That's going to dictate how serious it is."" Over the past year, the German government has tried to use the Snowden revelations -- chiefly the embarrassing disclosure about Ms. Merkel's cellphone -- as leverage to negotiate a non-spying pact between the United States and Germany. The United States has such arrangements with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. But the White House has resisted, in part because officials worry that it would prompt other countries to request similar deals. In early 2010, the director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, explored a nonspying pact with French intelligence officials, partly because Mr. Blair believed such a deal would ease the burden on the F.B.I., which has the task of hunting French spies in the United States.  The French are reputed to be particularly aggressive in pursuing American industrial secrets. In contrast, current and former American officials said that German operatives are far less active in the United States, making the benefits of a nonspying deal with Berlin less obvious.  Likewise, some question the value of spying on Germany. Such operations threaten the close intelligence-sharing relationship that American and German spies have developed in recent years. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the BND has aggressively pursued terror suspects in Germany and played a role in the crippling Stuxnet cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program.  ""There's only so much that spying on the Germans is going to get you,"" said a former C.I.A. official once posted in Europe. ""It's not like the Germans are planning to establish relations with Iran.""  Last week's disclosure came at a delicate moment: Mr. Obama needs Ms. Merkel's support to impose additional sanctions against Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis. Germany, with extensive energy ties to Russia, has many reasons to resist, though Ms. Merkel has signaled she is running out of patience with President Vladimir V. Putin. The American authorities are also pursuing heavy financial penalties from German banks, including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, for dealing with Iran and other countries that are blacklisted by the United States. The German government owns 17 percent of Commerzbank, raising the prospect of further tensions. The prospect of new strains between the United States and Germany drew an expression of concern from the secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who met with Mr. Obama at the White House on Tuesday. ""I encourage them to sort this out as quickly as possible,"" Mr. Rasmussen said in an interview after his meeting, adding, ""All NATO allies profit from an intensive exchange of information and intelligence, so that's also part of the whole equation."" For Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel, the N.S.A. disclosures poisoned what had been one of the president's closest relationships with a foreign leader. At a Group of 8 meeting in Camp David in 2012, Mr. Obama invited Ms. Merkel to linger after the other leaders left. At a state dinner a year earlier, she was serenaded by James Taylor singing, ""You've Got a Friend.""  Credit: MARK MAZZETTI and MARK LANDLER; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

1679,2430850685.xml,"Nearly every country has struggled to contain the coronavirus and made mistakes along the way.China committed the first major failure, silencing doctors who tried to raise alarms about the virus and allowing it to escape from Wuhan. Much of Europe went next, failing to avoid enormous outbreaks. Today, many countries -- Japan, Canada, France, Australia and more -- are coping with new increases in cases after reopening parts of society.Yet even with all of these problems, one country stands alone, as the only affluent nation to have suffered a severe, sustained outbreak for more than four months: the United States.When it comes to the virus, the United States has come to resemble not the wealthy and powerful countries to which it is often compared but instead far poorer countries, like Brazil, Peru and South Africa, or those with large migrant populations, like Bahrain and Oman.As in several of those other countries, the toll of the virus in the United States has fallen disproportionately on poorer people and groups that have long suffered discrimination. Black and Latino residents of the United States have contracted the virus at roughly three times as high of a rate as white residents.How did this happen? The New York Times set out to reconstruct the unique failure of the United States, through numerous interviews with scientists and public health experts around the world. The reporting points to two central themes.First, the United States faced longstanding challenges in confronting a major pandemic. It is a large country at the nexus of the global economy, with a tradition of prioritizing individualism over government restrictions. That tradition is one reason the United States suffers from an unequal health care system that has long produced worse medical outcomes -- including higher infant mortality and diabetes rates and lower life expectancy -- than in most other rich countries.""As an American, I think there is a lot of good to be said about our libertarian tradition,"" Dr. Jared Baeten, an epidemiologist and vice dean at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said. ""But this is the consequence -- we don't succeed as well as a collective.""The second major theme is one that public health experts often find uncomfortable to discuss because many try to steer clear of partisan politics. But many agree that the poor results in the United States stem in substantial measure from the performance of the Trump administration.In no other high-income country -- and in only a few countries, period -- have political leaders departed from expert advice as frequently and significantly as the Trump administration. President Trump has said the virus was not serious; predicted it would disappear; spent weeks questioning the need for masks; encouraged states to reopen even with large and growing caseloads; and promoted medical disinformation.In recent days, Mr. Trump has continued the theme, offering a torrent of misleading statistics in his public appearances that make the situation sound less dire than it is.Some Republican governors have followed his lead and also played down the virus, while others have largely followed the science. Democratic governors have more reliably heeded scientific advice, but their performance in containing the virus has been uneven.""In many of the countries that have been very successful they had a much crisper strategic direction and really had a vision,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who wrote a guide to reopening safely for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. ""I'm not sure we ever really had a plan or a strategy -- or at least it wasn't public.""Together, the national skepticism toward collective action and the Trump administration's scattered response to the virus have contributed to several specific failures and missed opportunities, Times reporting shows:a lack of effective travel restrictions;repeated breakdowns in testing;confusing advice about masks;a misunderstanding of the relationship between the virus and the economy;and inconsistent messages from public officials.Already, the American death toll is of a different order of magnitude than in most other countries. With only 4 percent of the world's population, the United States has accounted for 22 percent of coronavirus deaths. Canada, a rich country that neighbors the United States, has a per capita death rate about half as large. And these gaps may worsen in coming weeks, given the lag between new cases and deaths.For many Americans who survive the virus or do not contract it, the future will bring other problems. Many schools will struggle to open. And the normal activities of life -- family visits, social gatherings, restaurant meals, sporting events -- may be more difficult in the United States than in any other affluent country.A travel policy that fell shortIn retrospect, one of Mr. Trump's first policy responses to the virus appears to have been one of his most promising.On Jan. 31, his administration announced that it was restricting entry to the United States from China: Many foreign nationals -- be they citizens of China or other countries -- would not be allowed into the United States if they had been to China in the previous two weeks.It was still early in the spread of the virus. The first cases in Wuhan, China, had been diagnosed about a month before, and the first announced case in the United States had come on Jan. 21. In announcing the new travel policy, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, declared that the virus posed ""a public health emergency."" Mr. Trump described the policy as his ""China ban.""After the Trump administration acted, several other countries quickly announced their own restrictions on travel from China, including Japan, Vietnam and Australia.But it quickly became clear that the United States' policy was full of holes. It did not apply to immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents returning from China, for example. In the two months after the policy went into place, almost 40,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China.Even more important, the policy failed to take into account that the virus had spread well beyond China by early February. Later data would show that many infected people arriving in the United States came from Europe. (The Trump administration did not restrict travel from Europe until March and exempted Britain from that ban despite a high infection rate there.)The administration's policy also did little to create quarantines for people who entered the United States and may have had the virus.Authorities in some other places took a far more rigorous approach to travel restrictions.South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan largely restricted entry to residents returning home. Those residents then had to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with the government keeping close tabs to ensure they did not leave their home or hotel. South Korea and Hong Kong also tested for the virus at the airport and transferred anyone who was positive to a government facility.Australia offers a telling comparison. Like the United States, it is separated from China by an ocean and is run by a conservative leader -- Scott Morrison, the prime minister. Unlike the United States, it put travel restrictions at the center of its virus response.Australian officials noticed in March that the travel restrictions they had announced on Feb. 1 were not preventing the virus from spreading. So they went further.On March 27, Mr. Morrison announced that Australia would no longer trust travelers to isolate themselves voluntarily. The country would instead mandate that everyone arriving from overseas, including Australian citizens, spend two weeks quarantined in a hotel.The protocols were strict. As people arrived at an airport, the authorities transported them directly to hotels nearby. People were not even allowed to leave their hotel to exercise. The Australian military helped enforce the rules.Around the same time, several Australian states with minor outbreaks shut their own borders to keep out Australians from regions with higher rates of infection. That hardening of internal boundaries had not happened since the 1918 flu pandemic, said Ian Mackay, a virologist in Queensland, one of the first states to block entry from other areas.The United States, by comparison, imposed few travel restrictions, either for foreigners or American citizens. Individual states did little to enforce the rules they did impose.""People need a bit more than a suggestion to look after their own health,"" said Dr. Mackay, who has been working with Australian officials on their pandemic response. ""They need guidelines, they need rules -- and they need to be enforced.""Travel restrictions and quarantines were central to the success in controlling the virus in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia, as well as New Zealand, many epidemiologists believe. In Australia, the number of new cases per day fell more than 90 percent in April. It remained near zero through May and early June, even as the virus surged across much of the United States.In the past six weeks, Australia has begun to have a resurgence -- which itself points to the importance of travel rules. The latest outbreak stems in large part from problems with the quarantine in the city of Melbourne. Compared with other parts of Australia, Melbourne relied more on private security contractors who employed temporary workers -- some of whom lacked training and failed to follow guidelines -- to enforce quarantines at local hotels. Officials have responded by banning out-of-state travel again and imposing new lockdowns.Still, the tolls in Australia and the United States remain vastly different. Fewer than 300 Australians have died of complications from Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. If the United States had the same per capita death rate, about 3,300 Americans would have died, rather than 158,000.Enacting tough travel restrictions in the United States would not have been easy. It is more integrated into the global economy than Australia is, has a tradition of local policy decisions and borders two other large countries. But there is a good chance that a different version of Mr. Trump's restrictions -- one with fewer holes and stronger quarantines -- would have meaningfully slowed the virus's spread.Traditionally, public health experts had not seen travel restrictions as central to fighting a pandemic, given their economic costs and the availability of other options, like testing, quarantining and contact tracing, Dr. Baeten, the University of Washington epidemiologist, said. But he added that travel restrictions had been successful enough in fighting the coronavirus around the world that those views may need to be revisited.""Travel,"" he said, ""is the hallmark of the spread of this virus around the world.""The double testing failureOn Jan. 16, nearly a week before the first announced case of the coronavirus in the United States, a German hospital made an announcement. Its researchers had developed a test for the virus, which they described as the world's first.The researchers posted the formula for the test online and said they expected that countries with strong public health systems would soon be able to produce their own tests. ""We're more concerned about labs in countries where it's not that easy to transport samples, or staff aren't trained that thoroughly, or if there is a large number of patients who have to be tested,"" Dr. Christian Drosten, the director of the Institute for Virology at the hospital, known as Charité, in Berlin.It turned out, however, that the testing problems would not be limited to less-developed countries.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed their own test four days after the German lab did. C.D.C. officials claimed that the American test would be more accurate than the German one, by using three genetic sequences to detect the virus rather than two. The federal government quickly began distributing the American test to state officials.But the test had a flaw. The third genetic sequence produced inconclusive results, so the C.D.C. told state labs to pause their work. In meetings of the White House's coronavirus task force, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, played down the problem and said it would soon be solved.Instead, it took weeks to fix. During that time, the United States had to restrict testing to people who had clear reason to think they had the virus. All the while, the virus was quietly spreading.By early March, with the testing delays still unresolved, the New York region became a global center of the virus -- without people realizing it until weeks later. More widespread testing could have made a major difference, experts said, leading to earlier lockdowns and social distancing and ultimately less sickness and death.""You can't stop it if you can't see it,"" Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the director general at the World Health Organization, said.While the C.D.C. was struggling to solve its testing flaws, Germany was rapidly building up its ability to test. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a chemist by training, and other political leaders were watching the virus sweep across northern Italy, not far from southern Germany, and pushed for a big expansion of testing.By the time the virus became a problem in Germany, labs around the country had thousands of test kits ready to use. From the beginning, the government covered the cost of the tests. American laboratories often charge patients about $100 for a test.Without free tests, Dr. Hendrik Streeck, director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital Bonn, said at the time, ""a young person with no health insurance and an itchy throat is unlikely to go to the doctor and therefore risks infecting more people.""Germany was soon far ahead of other countries in testing. It was able to diagnose asymptomatic cases, trace the contacts of new patients and isolate people before they could spread the virus. The country has still suffered a significant outbreak. But it has had many fewer cases per capita than Italy, Spain, France, Britain or Canada -- and about one-fifth the rate of the United States.The United States eventually made up ground on tests. In recent weeks, it has been conducting more per capita than any other country, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.But now there is a new problem: The virus has grown even more rapidly than testing capacity. In recent weeks, Americans have often had to wait in long lines, sometimes in scorching heat, to be tested.One measure of the continuing troubles with testing is the percentage of tests that come back positive. In a country that has the virus under control, fewer than 5 percent of tests come back positive, according to World Health Organization guidelines. Many countries have reached that benchmark. The United States, even with the large recent volume of tests, has not.""We do have a lot of testing,"" Ms. Rivers, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, said. ""The problem is we also have a lot of cases.""The huge demand for tests has overwhelmed medical laboratories, and many need days -- or even up to two weeks -- to produce results. ""That really is not useful for public health and medical management,"" Ms. Rivers added. While people are waiting for their results, many are also spreading the virus.In Belgium recently, test results have typically come back in 48 to 72 hours. In Germany and Greece, it is two days. In France, the wait is often 24 hours.The double mask failureFor the first few months of the pandemic, public health experts could not agree on a consistent message about masks. Some said masks reduced the spread of the virus. Many experts, however, discouraged the use of masks, saying -- somewhat contradictorily -- that their benefits were modest and that they should be reserved for medical workers.""We don't generally recommend the wearing of masks in public by otherwise well individuals because it has not been up to now associated with any particular benefit,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, a World Health Organization official, said at a March 30 news conference.His colleague Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained that it was important to ""prioritize the use of masks for those who need them most.""The conflicting advice, echoed by the C.D.C. and others, led to relatively little mask wearing in many countries early in the pandemic. But several Asian countries were exceptions, partly because they had a tradition of mask wearing to avoid sickness or minimize the effects of pollution.By January, mask wearing in Japan was widespread, as it often had been during a typical flu season. Masks also quickly became the norm in much of South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and China.In the following months, scientists around the world began to report two strands of evidence that both pointed to the importance of masks: Research showed that the virus could be transmitted through droplets that hang in the air, and several studies found that the virus spread less frequently in places where people were wearing masks.On one cruise ship that gave passengers masks after somebody got sick, for example, many fewer people became ill than on a different cruise where people did not wear masks.Consistent with that evidence was Asia's success in holding down the number of cases (after China's initial failure to do so). In South Korea, the per capita death rate is about one-eightieth as large as in the United States; Japan, despite being slow to enact social distancing, has a death rate about one-sixtieth as large.""We should have told people to wear cloth masks right off the bat,"" Dr. George Rutherford of the University of California, San Francisco, said.In many countries, officials reacted to the emerging evidence with a clear message: Wear a mask.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada began wearing one in May. During a visit to an elementary school, President Emmanuel Macron of France wore a French-made blue mask that complemented his suit and tie. Zuzana Caputova, the president of Slovakia, created a social media sensation by wearing a fuchsia-colored mask that matched her dress.In the United States, however, masks did not become a fashion symbol. They became a political symbol.Mr. Trump avoided wearing one in public for months. He poked fun at a reporter who wore one to a news conference, asking the reporter to take it off and saying that wearing one was ""politically correct."" He described former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s decision to wear one outdoors as ""very unusual.""Many other Republicans and conservative news outlets, like Fox News, echoed his position. Mask wearing, as a result, became yet another partisan divide in a highly polarized country.Throughout much of the Northeast and the West Coast, more than 80 percent of people wore masks when within six feet of someone else. In more conservative areas, like the Southeast, the share was closer to 50 percent.A March survey found that partisanship was the biggest predictor of whether Americans regularly wore masks -- bigger than their age or whether they lived in a region with a high number of virus cases. In many of the places where people adopted a hostile view of masks, including Texas and the Southeast, the number of virus cases began to soar this spring.The first rule of virus economicsThroughout March and April, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and staff members held long meetings inside a conference room at the State Capitol in Atlanta. They ordered takeout lunches from local restaurants like the Varsity and held two daily conference calls with the public health department, the National Guard and other officials.One of the main subjects of the meetings was when to end Georgia's lockdown and reopen the state's economy. By late April, Mr. Kemp decided that it was time.Georgia had not met the reopening criteria laid out by the Trump administration (and many outside health experts considered those criteria too lax). The state was reporting about 700 new cases a day, more than when it shut down on April 3.Nonetheless, Mr. Kemp went ahead. He said that Georgia's economy could not wait any longer, and it became one of the first states to reopen.""I don't give a damn about politics right now,"" he said at an April 20 news conference announcing the reopening. He went on to describe business owners with employees at home who were ""going broke, worried about whether they can feed their children, make the mortgage payment.""Four days later, across Georgia, barbers returned to their chairs, wearing face masks and latex gloves. Gyms and bowling alleys were allowed to reopen, followed by restaurants on April 27. The stay-at-home order expired at 11:59 p.m. on April 30.Mr. Kemp's decision was part of a pattern: Across the United States, caseloads were typically much higher when the economy reopened than in other countries.As the United States endured weeks of closed stores and rising unemployment this spring, many politicians -- particularly Republicans, like Mr. Kemp -- argued that there was an unavoidable trade-off between public health and economic health. And if crushing the virus meant ruining the economy, maybe the side effects of the treatment were worse than the disease.Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, put the case most bluntly, and became an object of scorn, especially from the political left, for doing so. ""There are more important things than living,"" Mr. Patrick said in a television interview the same week that Mr. Kemp reopened Georgia.It may have been an inartful line, but Mr. Patrick's full argument was not wholly dismissive of human life. He was instead suggesting that the human costs of shutting down the economy -- the losses of jobs and income and the associated damages to living standards and people's health -- were greater than the costs of a virus that kills only a small percentage of people who get it.""We are crushing the economy,"" he said, citing the damage to his own children and grandchildren. ""We've got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.""The trouble with the argument, epidemiologists and economists agree, was that public health and the economy's health were not really in conflict.Early in the pandemic, Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist and former Obama administration official, proposed what he called the first rule of virus economics: ""The best way to fix the economy is to get control of the virus,"" he said. Until the virus was under control, many people would be afraid to resume normal life and the economy would not function normally.The events of the last few months have borne out Mr. Goolsbee's prediction. Even before states announced shutdown orders in the spring, many families began sharply reducing their spending. They were responding to their own worries about the virus, not any official government policy.And the end of lockdowns, like Georgia's, did not fix the economy's problems. It instead led to a brief increase in spending and hiring that soon faded.In the weeks after states reopened, the virus began surging. Those that opened earliest tended to have worse outbreaks, according to a Times analysis. The Southeast fared especially badly.In June and July, Georgia reported more than 125,000 new virus cases, turning it into one of the globe's new hot spots. That was more new cases than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Australia combined during that time frame.Americans, frightened by the virus's resurgence, responded by visiting restaurants and stores less often. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has stopped falling. The economy's brief recovery in April and May seems to have petered out in June and July.In large parts of the United States, officials chose to reopen before medical experts thought it wise, in an attempt to put people back to work and spark the economy. Instead, the United States sparked a huge new virus outbreak -- and the economy did not seem to benefit.""Politicians are not in control,"" Mr. Goolsbee said. ""They got all the illness and still didn't fix their economies.""The situation is different in the European Union and other regions that have had more success reducing new virus cases. Their economies have begun showing some promising signs, albeit tentative ones. In Germany, retail sales and industrial production have risen, and the most recent unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. In the United States, it was 11.1 percent.The message is the responseThe United States has not performed uniquely poorly on every measure of the virus response.Mask wearing is more common than throughout much of Scandinavia and Australia, according to surveys by YouGov and Imperial College London. The total death rate is still higher in Spain, Italy and Britain.But there is one way -- in addition to the scale of the continuing outbreaks and deaths -- that the United States stands apart: In no other high-income country have the messages from political leaders been nearly so mixed and confusing.These messages, in turn, have been amplified by television stations and websites friendly to the Republican Party, especially Fox News and the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which operates almost 200 local stations. To anybody listening to the country's politicians or watching these television stations, it would have been difficult to know how to respond to the virus.Mr. Trump's comments, in particular, have regularly contradicted the views of scientists and medical experts.The day after the first American case was diagnosed, he said, ""We have it totally under control."" In late February, he said: ""It's going to disappear. One day -- it's like a miracle -- it will disappear."" Later, he incorrectly stated that any American who wanted a test could get one. On July 28, he falsely proclaimed that ""large portions of our country"" were ""corona-free.""He has also promoted medical misinformation about the virus. In March, Mr. Trump called it ""very mild"" and suggested it was less deadly than the common flu. He has encouraged Americans to treat it with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, despite a lack of evidence about its effectiveness and concerns about its safety. At one White House briefing, he mused aloud about injecting people with disinfectant to treat the virus.These comments have helped create a large partisan divide in the country, with Republican-leaning voters less willing to wear masks or remain socially distant. Some Democratic-leaning voters and less political Americans, in turn, have decided that if everybody is not taking the virus seriously, they will not either. State leaders from both parties have sometimes created so many exceptions about which workplaces can continue operating normally that their stay-at-home orders have had only modest effects.""It doesn't seem we have had the same unity of purpose that I would have expected,"" Ms. Rivers, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, said. ""You need everyone to come together to accomplish something big.""Across much of Europe and Asia, as well as in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, leaders have delivered a consistent message: The world is facing a deadly virus, and only careful, consistent action will protect people.Many of those leaders have then pursued aggressive action. Mr. Trump and his top aides, by contrast, persuaded themselves in April that the virus was fading. They have also declined to design a national strategy for testing or other virus responses, leading to a chaotic mix of state policies.""If you had to summarize our approach, it's really poor federal leadership -- disorganization and denial,"" said Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare and Medicaid from 2015 to 2017. ""Watch Angela Merkel. Watch how she communicates with the public. Watch how Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand does it. They're very clear. They're very consistent about what the most important priorities are.""New York -- both the city and the state -- offers a useful case study. Like much of Europe, New York responded too slowly to the first wave of the virus. As late as March 15, Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged people to go to their neighborhood bar.Soon, the city and state were overwhelmed. Ambulances wailed day and night. Hospitals filled to the breaking point. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo -- a Democrat, like Mr. de Blasio -- was slow to protect nursing home residents, and thousands died. Earlier action in New York could have saved a significant number of lives, epidemiologists say.By late March, however, New York's leaders understood the threat, and they reversed course.They insisted that people stay home. They repeated the message every day, often on television. When other states began reopening, New York did not. ""You look at the states that opened fast without metrics, without guardrails, it's a boomerang,"" Mr. Cuomo said on June 4.The lockdowns and the consistent messages had a big effect. By June, New York and surrounding states had some of the lowest rates of virus spread in the country. Across much of the Southeast, Southwest and West Coast, on the other hand, the pandemic was raging.Many experts now say that the most disappointing part of the country's failure is that the outcome was avoidable.What may not have been avoidable was the initial surge of the virus: The world's success in containing previous viruses, like SARS, had lulled many people into thinking a devastating pandemic was unlikely. That complacency helps explains China's early mistakes, as well as the terrible death tolls in the New York region, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Britain and other parts of Europe.But these countries and dozens more -- as well as New York -- have since shown that keeping the virus in check is feasible.For all of the continuing uncertainty about how this new coronavirus is transmitted and how it affects the human body, much has become clear. It often spreads indoors, with close human contact. Talking, singing, sneezing and coughing play a major role in transmission. Masks reduce the risk. Restarting normal activity almost always leads to new cases that require quick action -- testing, tracing of patients and quarantining -- to keep the virus in check.When countries and cities have heeded these lessons, they have rapidly reduced the spread of the virus and been able to move back, gingerly, toward normal life. In South Korea, fans have been able to attend baseball games in recent weeks. In Denmark, Italy and other parts of Europe, children have returned to school.In the United States, the virus continues to overwhelm daily life.""This isn't actually rocket science,"" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who ran the New York City health department and the C.D.C. for a combined 15 years. ""We know what to do, and we're not doing it.""Contributing reporting were Damien Cave, J.

235,1020932077.xml,"      ATHENS -- Antonis Samaras, the leader of the center-right party that placed first in Greek parliamentary elections, began talks on Monday to form a coalition government aimed at keeping Greece in the euro zone and renegotiating its loan agreement with the foreign creditors keeping the country afloat.   But even as European leaders expressed relief at the outcome of the election, it was not clear how far Germany and the rest of Europe were prepared to go to ease the terms of Greece's bailout agreement -- or whether the results of the vote would improve life for Greece's fast-imploding middle class or stem a deepening political divide between right and left.   At the same time, attention quickly shifted to Spain, where market traders pushed up rates on its long-term bonds in an apparent expression of little confidence that the election in Greece would resolve many of Europe's larger problems.   In a televised statement after meeting with his Socialist counterpart, Evangelos Venizelos, Mr. Samaras said the two had agreed on the need to put their differences aside in a country with no strong tradition of coalition rule and form a governing bloc, something they were unable to achieve in elections in early May that yielded largely the same outcome.   ""We agreed that a government has to be formed within this exploratory mandate,"" which ends on Thursday, Mr. Samaras said. ""We will talk again.""    Mr. Samaras, whose party placed first but does not have enough seats to form a government on its own, also met with the leaders of two smaller parties: Independent Greeks on the right, whose leader appeared unlikely to join a coalition, and Democratic Left, whose leader may be open to joining one.   New Democracy won 29.6 percent of the vote, while the Socialists, who once dominated the electorate and were in power when Greece signed the first of its two loan agreements in 2010, placed third with 12.2 percent of the vote, or 32 seats. They were punished by austerity-weary voters who turned to the leftist party Syriza, which placed second with 70 seats.   Syriza spooked European leaders with its calls for tearing up Greece's loan deal and shifted the debate with its position that the loan agreement was fatally flawed, a point Mr. Samaras and Mr. Venizelos have both conceded.   After his talks with Syriza's leader, Alexis Tsipras, on Monday, Mr. Samaras emphasized the need to renegotiate the bailout conditions.   Mr. Venizelos had earlier said that his party would join a coalition only that included Syriza, but Mr. Tsipras has said his party will not join any government that supports the loan agreement, preferring instead to take on ""the role of a strong and responsible opposition"" and ""intervene in a powerful way.""   It remains to be seen whether any coalition Mr. Samaras forms will have popular support. Because of a peculiarity of Greek electoral law, in which 50 bonus seats go to the front-runner, a pro-bailout government will emerge from a vote in which half of Greeks actually voted for parties that are opposed to the bailout or its conditions.   Speaking at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Mexico on Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Greece must honor the commitments it has already signed in its loan deal with creditors.   But with a backlash against austerity growing by the day -- not only in Greece but in larger countries including Spain and Italy -- creditors are likely to be sympathetic to arguments that Mr. Samaras had vowed to make to ease the burden on the average Greek citizen. ""We would be crazy not to grant them some flexibility,"" said a European Union official in Brussels, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly since negotiations are pending.   European Union officials said Greece's creditors would likely show some flexibility, especially on the time frame in which Greece is expected to reduce its budget deficit. To slash its deficit rapidly, the Greek government has raised taxes and cut wages, actions that have hit families hard and caused the real economy to dry up.   ""The conditions that were negotiated have to be observed, but we also need to give the Greeks room to breathe,"" said Austria's chancellor, Werner Faymann. ""For example, it must be assured that people have sufficient access to medicine. Consolidation cannot be carried out solely on the backs of the people.""   Many Greeks said they had feared that a Syriza victory would have pushed their country closer to quitting the euro, but many others feel they are paying for the profligacy of the same political parties, the Socialists and New Democracy, that caused Greece to seek a bailout and then imposed austerity measures that have helped push unemployment to 22 percent.   ""We're an experiment,"" said Vasso Kalama, 28, an architecture student who said she had voted for a small left-wing party that did not make it into Parliament. Her friend, Stella Soundoulounaki, 25, a medical resident, agreed.   ""It's going to be even worse,"" she said. ""After two elections it's the same government, and they have the people's O.K. to proceed doing exactly what they were doing."" Ms. Soundoulounaki said that her monthly wages had been cut to about $1,000 from $2,275 and that she would take to the streets if the government imposed more austerity measures. ""Now people have nothing to lose if they come to the streets and protest,"" she said.   Greece's new leaders face the formidable tasks of trying to slash public spending and restore growth as the economy is in its fifth year of a grinding recession. That task would seem impossible in the near term without more help from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The government is rapidly running out of money -- state coffers will run dry in mid-July, officials say -- and is struggling to draw in tax revenue, much less lure investments from wary foreign companies.   The next government must act fast. Greece's troika of foreign creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- are scheduled to send the country bailout payments totaling $9.6 billion at the end of June -- but only on the condition that Greece identify an additional $14.5 billion in savings.    If Greece manages to form a government committed to pushing through structural changes, the troika will likely agree to new bailout terms -- as well as to the conditions surrounding a third bailout package for Greece, before an end-of-September deadline, said the European Union official who insisted on anonymity.    But the lenders are unlikely to bend on demands for key reforms, including that Athens instill more flexibility in the Greek labor market and press ahead with the politically charged requirement to cut tens of thousands of civil service workers from a government that has more than a million.

1534,433885370.xml,"      Senator Barack Obama stood before a sea of cheering admirers on Thursday and sought to inspire fresh cooperation among American allies to defeat terrorism and other threats, introducing himself as a leader who could summon other nations to join the United States in confronting the world's next challenges.   On a perch steeped in history, Mr. Obama said it was time to reprise the spirit that conquered communism, and use it to heal divisions and forge closer partnerships to deal with nuclear proliferation, global warming, poverty and genocide. Without naming President Bush or going into detail about European disenchantment with the Iraq war and other policies of the current administration, he suggested the United States would become a better partner, but called on European countries to uphold their responsibilities.   ""The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand,"" Mr. Obama said, putting a new twist on the cold war calls to bring down the barrier that divided Berlin. ""The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down.""   The German police estimated that more than 200,000 people came to hear him speak from the base of the Victory Column in the Tiergarten, a sprawling park in the center of the city. Berliners waved American flags -- provided by the campaign -- throughout the address, offering precisely the visual message that Mr. Obama's aides wanted to beam back home: a candidate who could restore the world's faith in strong American leadership and idealism.    He looked out toward the Brandenburg Gate, where President Ronald Reagan once implored the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall"" and end the cold war.    The setting of the speech, as well as the size of the crowd, seemed to place Mr. Obama among a litany of American leaders who have stood before him, even though he is simply a first-term United States senator.   ""I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for president, but as a citizen -- a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world.""   In his 30-minute address, Mr. Obama did not overtly criticize Mr. Bush or his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain, but he did offer a gentle dose of criticism of his own nation. That, too, drew loud cheers from the crowd.   ""I know my country has not perfected itself,"" he said. ""We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions. But I also know how much I love America.""   As he offered a glimpse of an active foreign policy, should he be elected -- mentioning Darfur, Zimbabwe and Burma in his address -- he signaled an intention to leave behind what Mr. Bush's critics see as often-misguided unilateralism in favor of greater cooperation. Yet Mr. Obama also suggested that he would expect the cooperation to flow both ways, urging Europe to be more supportive of sending additional NATO troops to Afghanistan, a politically unpopular stance in Germany.   ""No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone,"" Mr. Obama said. On the other side of the Atlantic on Thursday, Mr. McCain campaigned in Ohio, where he belittled Mr. Obama's grasp of foreign policy and criticized him for traveling to Germany to deliver the address.   ""I'd love to give a speech in Germany -- a political speech or a speech that maybe the German people would be interested in,"" Mr. McCain told a crowd in Ohio, ""but I'd much prefer to do it as president of the United States rather than as a candidate.""    Republicans called Mr. Obama's visit presumptuous, but in his first trip to Berlin he was treated with unusual deference. Local newspapers and television stations chased him around town, offering minute-by-minute updates of his whereabouts. Hundreds of people lined streets at several points around town as his motorcade passed by.   Campaign volunteers holding clipboards shouted to passers-by, ""Stop here, registering American citizens to vote!"" Bratwurst-and-beer stands shared space with vendors who were selling an array of Obama products, including a T-shirt that declared, ""The World For Obama '08.""   Manfred Krause, 65, a retired citizen of the former East Germany, said Mr. Obama's address brought back memories of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s quieter visit to East Berlin in 1964, when he was a student. As Mr. Krause waited for Mr. Obama's arrival on Thursday, he said, ""I thought, here is someone coming from the same place.""   The response to Mr. Obama has been so warm that the coordinator for German-American relations in the foreign ministry here, Karsten D. Voigt, sought to scale back expectations. He reminded Germans in interview after interview that Mr. Obama would have to support positions unpopular with the German public, like a stronger presence engaged in more fighting for the Bundeswehr, the German army, in Afghanistan.   First and foremost, Mr. Obama was well received because he is not Mr. Bush, who is unpopular in Germany. But Mr. Obama said a new president in the United States would not take away the responsibility for the countries to increase their partnership.   ""No doubt, there will be differences in the future, but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together,"" Mr. Obama said. ""A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more -- not less.""   In Washington, Mr. Bush also gave a speech on America's role in the world on Thursday, and there were some striking thematic parallels between his and Mr. Obama's.    Mr. Bush talked about hope. He sought to revive the spirit of NATO, the Berlin Airlift of 1948 and the Marshall Plan for a new era and a new war against extremism. He championed the victims of political oppression in places like Darfur, Iran, Myanmar and Zimbabwe. But Mr. Bush's address was not televised, while Mr. Obama's was broadcast live on all the cable news networks. Throughout his address, Mr. Obama said that the path of history -- the Berlin Airlift and the cold war fight against communism -- offered hope for a future in dealing with eliminating nuclear weapons, dealing with Iran and resolving the conflict in the Middle East.   ""This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it,"" Mr. Obama said. ""This threat is real, and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it.""   While in Berlin, Mr. Obama met for about an hour with Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Federal Chancellery. Later, he held a session with Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. While Mr. Obama talked about the Iraq war in private sessions, aides said, he made only a passing mention of it in his speech.   The address received overwhelmingly positive attention from the German news media, which has frequently gushed over Mr. Obama for his aura, or as the large-circulation Bild daily put it on Wednesday, the ""political pop star.""

3509,433291474.xml,"      Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Saturday that the world must act now to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, evoking her nation's own history as a cautionary tale of what can happen when threats to peace remain unchecked. ''We want, we must prevent Iran from developing its nuclear program further,'' Mrs. Merkel told an audience of top security officials and policy makers during a speech to the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy. Mrs. Merkel, whose speech came on the same day that the International Atomic Energy Agency voted to report Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council, said Germany's own experiences during the 1930's should be a warning over how to deal with Iran. ''Now we see that there were times when we could have acted differently,'' she said. ''For that reason Germany is obliged to make clear what is permissible and what isn't.''  The annual Munich conference was first established in the height of the cold war, when Germany was divided and more than 350,000 American troops were stationed in Western Europe to protect it against communist Warsaw Pact forces. At the conference, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged the world to work for a ''diplomatic solution'' to halt the nuclear program of Iran, saying that the United States stands ''with the Iranian people, who want a peaceful, democratic future.''  ''The Iranian regime is today the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,'' he added. ''The world does not want, and must work together to prevent, a nuclear Iran.''  Mrs. Merkel, discarding any diplomatic niceties and raising her voice in a tone of frustration, said Iran had ''blatantly crossed the red line'' -- and not only with regard to respecting its international obligations as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. She said it was also ''unacceptable'' for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to deny the Holocaust and say that Israel should be ''wiped off the map.''  ''A president that questions Israel's right to exist, a president that denies the Holocaust, cannot expect to receive any tolerance from Germany,'' Mrs. Merkel said to applause. ''We have learned our history.'' Germany is one of the three European Union countries that has negotiated with Iran over the past two and a half years to try to persuade it to stop its uranium enrichment program, which can ultimately be used to produce either electricity or nuclear weapons. Iran has always insisted the enrichment program is for peaceful purposes only. Mrs. Merkel, 51, said Iran was a threat to both Europe and Israel. But she insisted that diplomacy rather than military action was the way to deal with the threat. ''Diplomatic avenues need to be exhausted,'' she said. ''We need to keep our nerves, go step by step.''  Abbas Araghchi, deputy foreign minister of Iran, challenged Mrs. Merkel, saying Iran had not crossed any lines. If Iran was referred to the United Nations Security Council, he said, it is obliged by its own laws to stop all cooperation with the atomic energy agency, a position Iran reiterated after the agency's vote. Mrs. Merkel said Iran should ''change the law.'' She then urged China, Russia and others to join the United States, Germany and European nations to pressure Iran to return to the negotiating table. ''The broader this is, the more significant it will be for Iran,'' she said. Mr. Rumsfeld, who spoke after Mrs. Merkel, gave a short speech painting a grim picture about the campaign against terrorism, warning that it would it would be a long, though winnable, one. ''Our situation today resembles that of free nations in the early days of the cold war,'' he said. Mr. Rumsfeld did not comment on the decision to refer Iran to the Security Council. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said at the conference that he was ''very pleased'' that Iran would be referred to the Security Council. ''With a nuclear deterrent, Iran would feel unconstrained to threaten anyone,'' he told the participants. ''It would induce Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia and others to reassess their defense postures.''  ''Every option must remain on the table,'' he added. ''There is only one thing worse than military action. That is a nuclear armed Iran. The regime must understand it can't win a showdown with the world.''  Mr. McCain called for a travel ban and an asset freeze for some Iranian officials and nuclear scientists, saying, ''it is in the interests of Russia and China to support these moves, regardless of their economic interests.''

2564,1349049692.xml,"       BRUSSELS -- The European Union's halting effort to create a more unified banking system, which many experts consider necessary for avoiding future financial crises, received fresh impetus on Tuesday. Two top E.U. finance officials gave a push forward to efforts to overhaul governance of the region's banks, easing concerns that the bloc is failing to move swiftly enough to avoid future crises that could sink the euro. Speaking in Berlin, Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, signaled support for moving ahead with efforts to create a so-called banking union. Germany, and Mr. Schäuble in particular had been widely viewed as standing in the way of progress, demanding a potentially complicated treaty change to proceed.  ""Naturally, with the inertia that we have in Europe, we cannot wait for treaty changes to solve current problems,"" Mr. Schäuble told an audience at the Free University in Berlin. ""We have to make the best of it on the basis of the current treaties."" German officials say there has no been a change in their stance, but proponents see a softening in tone that could signal a new openness.  Meanwhile on Tuesday in Brussels, the president of the euro zone's group of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said it would be ""dangerous"" to delay moving ahead with a banking union. He said some of the bloc's biggest banks could reveal new vulnerabilities as their accounts come under scrutiny in the next few months as part of a new round of so-called stress-test audits expected to be conducted by the European Central Bank.  Last month at a finance minister's meeting in Dublin, Mr. Schäuble conceded that a banking union could go forward under current E.U. law. But he still insisted then that treaty change would eventually be needed for a new single banking supervisor, under the aegis of the E.C.B., to work effectively. As the euro zone's paymaster, Germany has considerable clout in the banking union debate. On Tuesday, Mr. Schäuble still said there was a need for ""institutional changes"" in the medium term, requiring changes to the treaty. But he indicated that near-term problems required timely attention.  German leaders, however, remain cautious about any moves that could lead to further euro zone demands for money from their country. Chancellor Angela Merkel, up for re-election in September, has shown little inclination to test the patience of a bailout-weary electorate. E.U. leaders agreed last year to create a banking union as a way of breaking the so-called doom loop. This is a vicious circle in which states go so deeply into debt to support failing banks that they require bailouts or risk leaving the euro zone. But that agreement in principle has been hard to put into practice.  The question of how to regulate banks under a banking union has been politically contentious as the European debt crisis rumbles on. Bailing out banks has been one of the biggest factors in Europe's financial crisis, and Mr. Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said Tuesday that Europe continued to face ""very dangerous"" situation unless all its members started using the same rule book for restructuring or shutting down failing banks.  A standard process for winding down troubled banks would be a key component of a banking union.  The effect of huge bank debt on state finances almost forced Ireland and Cyprus to leave the euro zone before they received bailouts. And is now a major concern for Spain, which has received banking bailout money from the euro zone, and Slovenia, which is scrambling to avoid asking for a bailout. German officials had warned that adding the politically fraught business of bank supervision to the E.C.B.'s responsibility for monetary policy would risk the bank's independence.  At the Dublin meeting last month, Mr. Schäuble insisted that a treaty change, to keep those areas of responsibility distinct, would eventually be needed for the banking supervisor to work effectively. That threw up an unexpected and potentially formidable roadblock.  He also said a treaty change would be needed to create institutions to share the burden of restructuring and closing banks.  Many other countries resist trying to make any changes to the European Union's treaties at a time when Britain is already seeking modifications that many other member states oppose. And Europe's economic problems have made many citizens so disenchanted with the Union that they might very likely vote down any treaty changes.  German officials continue to argue that it is more important to get the banking union right than to adopt it quickly. But supporters of a swifter pace regarded Mr. Schäuble's go-slow message as blocking one of the few paths they see out of Europe's debt trap.  Mr. Dijsselbloem, speaking on Tuesday in Brussels at an economics conference, emphasized the need to establish a banking union to enable the restructuring of shaky banks, and the orderly shutdown of failing ones, because the coming bank stress tests -- which officials have dubbed an asset quality review -- could raise new questions about some of those lenders' viability. ""The outcome of that asset quality review we don't know yet, but it might be worrying,"" Mr. Dijsselbloem said. ""It might be worrying for some banks in some countries -- we don't exactly know.""  He added: ""What I do know is that when we do have an outcome that is worrying, we need to have the instruments to deal with the problems. Because just exposing problems in banks and not having an answer how to recapitalize banks and how to strengthen them, that would be very dangerous."" The comments by Mr. Dijsselbloem and Mr. Schäuble come against the backdrop of a worsening economic picture in the euro area and the wider Union. The deteriorating economy in the European Union is expected to drive unemployment to new highs this year in countries including Spain and Portugal that already are feeling acute pain. ""Unfortunately, unemployment is forecast to stay at the unbearable level of 11 percent in the E.U. and 12 percent in the euro area this year,"" Olli Rehn, the E.U. commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, told the same conference in Brussels on Tuesday. ""We expect a gradual turnaround to begin only next year,"" he said. Next Monday, euro zone finance ministers are to gather in Brussels for a monthly meeting overseen by Mr. Dijsselbloem. He is expected to lead talks to make progress on a rule book for directly injecting funds from the European bailout fund into troubled banks.  Next Tuesday, finance ministers from across the bloc will join the meeting for discussions expected to focus on rules for dealing with creditors in order to shut down banks without putting the burden on taxpayers. National representatives meeting in Brussels this week are trying to resolve differences about which bank depositors should be forced to bear losses. Nicholas Kulish reported from Berlin.

The workers' rebellion, which began at the shipyard in his hometown, Gdansk, gave him, as a bored young man who was something of a hooligan, real meaning.

But the problems of migrants, borders and Islamophobia were all stoked domestically, with Brussels as a handy scapegoat.The conflict was particularly complicated, even emotionally so, with Mr. Tusk's old friend and anti-Communist colleague, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban. And he is now even more Mr. Tusk's problem.Mr. Tusk has just begun a new job in Brussels as head of a center-right party grouping called the European People's Party. Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party are prominent members, and Mr. Tusk's predecessor did very little to rein in Mr. Orban, because the party needed his votes in the European Parliament. So what will Mr. Tusk do?Mr. Tusk is struggling to answer, because he has seen the transformation of Mr. Orban from an idealistic anti-Communist to a populist authoritarian, dabbling in Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and proud of creating an ""illiberal democracy.""""I have a problem with Viktor Orban, but also a private one, a personal one,"" Mr. Tusk said. ""Because we have known each other for so many years and our friendship started when he was one of the most talented and promising liberal democrats in our part of Europe,"" who stood up to the Communist authorities in 1989.""When I was president of the European Council he was my partner, and paradoxically, also because of our old friendship, we were personally very loyal to each other,"" Mr. Tusk said. Then he hesitated, sighed, then said, ""This is why it is something painful for me, because I like him as a person.""Mr. Orban is smart, Mr. Tusk agreed. ""You know this is why I think he is cynical, because he is too intelligent not to understand what is the problem. And of course cynicism is nothing new in politics, but the practical consequences of his cynicism in Hungary are,"" he stopped again, then said: ""I think it went too far. At least it's my opinion.""That opinion is shared by many, but Mr. Orban, by using his mandate to alter the Hungarian Constitution to his benefit, remains a powerful force inside the European Union and for populist, identitarian and anti-Brussels politics generally. His challenge to the rule of law is even more profound than that of the government of Poland.A request for comment from Mr. Orban was not answered.Once the highly praised prime minister of Poland, who resigned in 2014 to run the European Council, Mr. Tusk and his party lost the 2015 election to the populist Law and Justice party and its effective leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, now his archrival.As part of Mr. Kaczynski's campaign against the European-minded heirs of Solidarity, he has even accused Mr. Tusk of being responsible for the 2010 plane crash in Russia that killed his twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, then Poland's president.""Yeah, yeah, I'm a murderer, a thief,"" Mr. Tusk responds, laughing. ""I will survive anyway, I am quite experienced here, so this is nothing new for me.""But the intensity of the attacks represents something new, he said, a reflection of a broader problem with democratic debate he sees in Europe, the United States and Britain, over Brexit.""It's this shameless use of state-organized lies as a permanent tool and permanent method,"" he said. Ten years ago, he said, ""it would be something disqualifying for politicians,"" but no longer.Now it cuts to the heart of the European Union's idea of liberal democracy, shared values and the rule of law. And this is what is so troubling about the current trends in Central Europe, especially in Poland and in Hungary.""For me the red line is if someone is able and is ready to accept our fundamental set of values,"" Mr. Tusk said. ""We can describe this set with the simple term 'liberal democracy.' ""That, he said, included a commitment to ""freedom of speech, political pluralism, respect for the individual, tolerance, openness"" -- everything that used to be clear, and now is under threat.Still, he admits, the problem of Mr. Orban is even harder, because many in Europe, including Mr. Tusk, think he was correct in his strong defense of Europe's borders against uncontrolled immigration, inspired in part by the controversial decision of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to open her country's borders.Mr. Orban argued that Europe could not preserve the borderless internal Schengen area unless it defended Schengen's own borders. He then reinforced Hungary's with guards and barbed wire, herding migrants who tried to cross illegally into holding areas and refusing to take any Brussels-imposed quota of asylum-seekers, all to much publicity.""From the very beginning, I was absolutely sure that in some part of his approach he was right,"" Mr. Tusk said. While despising Mr. Orban's rhetoric, he said, he saw that ""the conflict between Orban and Merkel was something really very substantive.""""At the end of the day,"" he said, ""not only the European People's Party but the whole European family understood that if you want to have an asylum policy you have to be able to control the external borders.""What damaged Ms. Merkel was the sense of chaos and loss of control. But Mr. Orban understood, Mr. Tusk said, that ""the first condition is order, absolutely.""And that brought Mr. Tusk, as a liberal democrat, to what he describes as his nightmare. ""The biggest fear today, not only in Europe, is that people think that liberalism is a synonym for vulnerability and disorder and chaos and weakness,"" he said.""Liberal democracy must be also strong and decisive and sometimes even ruthless in protecting, you know, their own people, borders, territories, etc.,"" he added. ""If people start to believe that there is no possibility to combine freedom and a liberal set of values with safety and security and order, then we have no chance to survive.""Then, the field will be open to even more dictatorial populist politicians, he said.As for what he will do about Mr. Orban, Mr. Tusk refused to answer, citing a coming report from former party notables, including his predecessor as Council president, Herman Van Rompuy. Mr. Tusk said he will then make a formal recommendation to the larger party in February.But the politics remain awkward, Mr. Tusk admitted. ""I can recommend some solutions,"" he said, adding: ""Of course, it's a problem also because of this migration debate. Because almost no one in the E.P.P. wants to punish Orban because of this very context.""Donald Tusk, right, ex-president of the European Council, gave the ceremonial bell to his successor, Charles Michel, last month.

1812,1916098004.xml,"Western European efforts to isolate President Trump for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement appear to be faltering as leaders gather for a summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, at the end of the week.The gulf between Mr. Trump's worldview and that of most European leaders on topics from trade to immigration will be on display in the coming days. But nowhere is the difference as stark as it is on climate change, which Mr. Trump has mocked as a hoax.In announcing last month that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, the president portrayed the pact signed by 194 nations to cut planet-warming emissions as a bad deal for America.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has cast the agenda of the Group of 20 summit meeting as a stark contrast to Mr. Trump's America First approach, particularly on climate change. She has called the Paris accord ""irreversible,"" and diplomats have expressed hope that the 19 other countries would make it clear that their support is unwavering. Environmental activists, hoping to highlight America's status as an outlier, also are pushing hard for a united front against Mr. Trump.In recent days, however, those aiming to isolate the United States on climate issues have softened their language to say they hope an ""overwhelming majority"" embrace the Paris agreement. Saudi Arabia has indicated it is unlikely to climb on board and Russia, Turkey and Indonesia are sending mixed signals about how forcefully they will declare their support for the Paris deal.""Huge efforts are underway now to make sure as many countries as possible hold the line and compensate for America's withdrawal by redoubling their efforts. How far this goes, I have my doubts,"" said Dennis Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a leading German think tank advising the European Commission ahead of the summit meeting.""It doesn't look good,"" Mr. Snower said. ""It does not look like we are going to have 19 countries and the United States against.""The Group of 20 meeting is the first high-level diplomatic gathering since Mr. Trump announced last month that America would exit the Paris agreement. How full-throated a case other rich nations are willing to make for the climate deal now could set the tone for years to come.Some fear the future of the Paris agreement itself could be at stake. At a minimum, a weak statement or one that fails to clearly cast the United States as a renegade on climate change would signal that leaders are reluctant to jeopardize deals on trade or security by antagonizing the Trump administration over climate issues.""This is a litmus test. How does the world behave?"" said Jonathan Pershing, former special envoy for climate change under President Barack Obama and now director of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's environment program.Climate change policy is playing out in two places at the Group of 20. The first is in a document currently titled ""G20 Action Plan on Climate and Energy for Growth,"" which tells how nations can make good on their pledges. A May 5 draft obtained by The New York Times calls for nations to meet the emissions goals they set as part of the Paris agreement. A footnote explains the United States is reviewing its policies.An important second place is the Group of 20 communiqué, the leaders' official report of the summit meeting, and how it will address the Paris agreement. The Trump administration clearly will not accept language that commits the Group of 20 nations to the Paris agreement, but France and Germany are indicating they will not accept anything less.""It would be great to have a clear message that everyone understands we need to be taking action on climate change, and the Paris agreement is critical to that. Canada is really pushing for that,"" said Catherine McKenna, the Canadian minister of the environment.A proposal by Germany says leaders ""take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris agreement. The United States affirms its strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs."" The other countries, it says, agree that the Paris accord is ""irreversible.""A Trump administration official declined to say whether that language would be accepted, but maintained the United States was not trying to pull other countries away from the Paris agreement.""From a high level, what we're looking for is a positive outcome, one in which the chancellor and the president can walk away happy,"" the official said. ""We're very much committed to a unity document.""That is a way of saying the administration would prefer not to be left as a footnote again the way it was in the recent statement by the Group of 7's environment ministers. The Trump administration refused to support language calling the Paris agreement ""irreversible"" and central to the ""security and prosperity of our planet."" If the Trump administration and other leaders cannot agree on a way to sum up their divergent opinions on climate change, trade and other issues, Ms. Merkel might be forced to simply write a summary of where various countries stand.""A collision course is unavoidable, but the chancellor is doing her very best to avoid one,"" Mr. Snower said.It is not at all clear at this point what will emerge. Tensions are high between Turkey and several European nations, including Germany, where officials have refused to allow a demonstration of ethnic Turks at the summit meeting. Indonesia has ratified the Paris agreement but has been silent in more recent discussions, one diplomat said. Russia is similarly not showing its hand.Saudi Arabia is a wild card. Fresh off a $500 million arms deal with the United States that narrowly escaped Senate opposition, the Saudis are eager to keep Mr. Trump's support for the kingdom's crackdown against Qatar. Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest per capita emitters of planet-warming emissions, has always been a reluctant participant in climate discussions.Conservatives in the United States say Europeans should know by now that goading Mr. Trump is likely to fail.""It's like trying to poke a bear,"" said Nicolas Loris, a research fellow in energy and environmental policy at the Heritage Foundation. ""President Trump will stick to his convictions. I don't think any type of pressure from Merkel or any of the other 19 countries is going to change that.""Follow @NYTClimate on Twitter",2017-07-06
2358,433849857.xml,"      Last September, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, courageously broke with her predecessors and met with the Dalai Lama. China predictably objected, soon joined by Mrs. Merkel's vice chancellor and foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who accused her of trying to ""showcase"" human rights.    Now Mr. Steinmeier has one-upped himself, refusing to meet with the Dalai Lama, who was on a five-day visit to Germany while Mrs. Merkel was out of the country. The only German official to meet with the Dalai Lama was the development minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who properly considered it one of the ""core tasks"" of her office. Mr. Steinmeier issued the cynical statement that ""it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days.""   Presumably it also took great courage for Mr. Steinmeier to rush to Moscow to lavishly congratulate the new president, Dmitri Medvedev, again in contrast to Mrs. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and has been critical of the Kremlin over human rights. Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Steinmeier come from competing parties, and their service in the same government is a matter of necessity, not preference. Still, it was destructive of Mr. Steinmeier to break ranks with the leader of his government on human rights. The signal is that Germany will do anything to make money in China.   Mr. Steinmeier's defenders will undoubtedly argue that ""quiet diplomacy"" is better than a public rebuke. If he has been involved in any quiet diplomacy in China, or Russia, or Uzbekistan, or anyplace else he has shown his ""courage,"" it is hard to find evidence of it. Meeting leaders like the Dalai Lama, and trying to mediate in the crucial talks he is holding with Beijing, is a ""core task"" of a foreign minister.    Fortunately, the German people are more stalwart than their foreign minister, as 25,000 turned out at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to hear the Dalai Lama express his condolences to China over the earthquake. He is in Britain now, and he is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Gordon Brown.      ",2008-05-22

But the Nasdaq composite index slipped as the stocks of Chinese companies listed in the United States fell on the news of an investigation of accounting practices.    The Labor Department said initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low last week.   Europe again averted disaster in its debt crisis when members of the German Parliament rallied behind Chancellor Angela Merkel to approve a stronger euro zone bailout fund on Thursday.

Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland, said the news was especially bad because markets were already experiencing high levels of uncertainty and volatility.   High-tech shares pressured the Nasdaq, with Amazon.com off 3.2 percent at $222.44 after a sharp rally on Wednesday. Advanced Micro Devices sank 13.7 percent to $5.31 after it cut its third-quarter revenue outlook, prompting many analysts to downgrade their views on the stock.   Apple shares fell 1.6 percent to $390.57 on profit taking after gaining more than 16 percent during the quarter.   Other large-cap Internet names were also down. Netflix sank 11 percent to $113.19, while Yahoo lost 5.4 percent to $13.42.    A Merrill Lynch index of Internet stocks, which includes Amazon and Yahoo, fell 3.01 percent.

2435,2131644235.xml,"The Rev. Joseph Musser's family has always lived in the region of Alsace, but not always in the same country.His grandfather fought for the Germans in World War I, and his father for the French in World War II. Today, no one is fighting anymore. His great-niece lives in France but works in Germany, crossing the border her ancestors died fighting over without even noticing it.It is this era of peace and borderless prosperity that champions of the European Union consider the bloc's singular achievement.""The foundation of the European Union is the memory of war,"" said the Reverend Musser, 72. ""But that memory is fading.""On Sunday, as dozens of world leaders gather in Paris to mark the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I, the chain of memory that binds Mr. Musser's family -- and all of Europe -- is growing brittle.The anniversary comes amid a feeling of gloom and insecurity as the old demons of chauvinism and ethnic division are again spreading across the Continent. And as memory turns into history, one question looms large: Can we learn from history without having lived it ourselves?In the aftermath of their cataclysmic wars, Europeans banded together in shared determination to subdue the forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred with a vision of a European Union. It is no coincidence that the bloc placed part of its institutional headquarters in Alsace's capital, Strasbourg.But today, its younger generations have no memory of industrialized slaughter. Instead, their consciousness has been shaped by a decade-long financial crisis, an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, and a sense that the promise of a united Europe is not delivering. To some it feels that Europe's bloody last century might as well be the Stone Age.Yet World War I killed more than 16 million soldiers and civilians, and its legacies continue to shape Europe.""The war to end all wars"" set the scene for an even more devastating conflict and the barbarism of genocide. Winston Churchill, Britain's legendary wartime leader, thought of 1914-1945 as one long war.""Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it,"" he said in 1948.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose decision to welcome more than a million migrants to Germany in 2015 first became a symbol of a liberal European order, then a rallying cry for a resurgent far-right, said the jury is still out on whether Europe will heed the lessons of its past.""We now live in a time in which the eyewitnesses of this terrible period of German history are dying,"" she said of World War II. ""In this phase, it will be decided whether we have really learned from history.""Indeed, the last World War I veteran died in 2012. And the number of those who experienced World War II and the Holocaust is rapidly shrinking, too.Politicians are apt to use history selectively when it suits them. But the history in this case is ominous.Now as then, Europe's political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments.In Italy, a founding member of the European Union, Matteo Salvini, the nationalist deputy prime minister, has turned away migrant boats and called for the expulsion of Roma. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary speaks of a ""Muslim takeover"" and unapologetically flaunts his version of ""illiberal democracy.""""In 1990, Europe was our future,"" he said earlier this year. ""Now, we are Europe's future.""The political discourse is deteriorating in familiar ways, too. In Germany, the far right has become the main voice of opposition in Parliament, mocking the mainstream media as ""Lügenpresse,"" or lying press -- a term that was first used by the Nazis in the 1920s before their ascent to power.Traute Lafrenz, the last surviving member of the White Rose, an anti-Hitler student resistance group in the 1940s, said she got goose bumps seeing images of Hitler salutes at far-right riots in the eastern German city of Chemnitz recently.""Maybe it's no coincidence,"" Ms. Lafrenz, now 99, told Der Spiegel. ""We are dying out and at the same time everything is coming back again.""After World War II, the European Union sought to prevent anything like it from happening again by gradually creating a common market, a common currency, a passport-free travel zone and by pooling sovereignty in a number of areas.But on Sunday, standing next to Ms. Merkel and her host, the fiercely pro-European French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be a number of nationalist leaders who would like nothing more than to pull the European Union apart -- among them President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Historians guard against drawing direct parallels between the fragile aftermath of World War I and the present, pointing to a number of notable differences.Before World War I, a Europe of empires had just become a Europe of nation states; there was no tried and tested tradition of liberal democracy. Economic hardship was on another level altogether; children were dying of malnutrition in Berlin.Above all, there is not now the kind of militaristic culture that was utterly mainstream in Europe at the time. France and Germany, archenemies for centuries, are closely allied.""What is being eroded today, is being eroded from a much higher level than anything we had ever achieved in Europe in the past,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at the University of Oxford.Still, Mr. Garton Ash sees 1918 as a warning that democracy and peace can never be taken for granted.""It's a really sobering reminder that what seems like some sort of eternal order can very rapidly collapse,"" he said.In that sense, if Europe's motto after World War II was ""never again,"" the lesson of World War I is ""it could happen again.""Daniel Schönpflug, a German historian who recently published ""A World on Edge,"" an evocative book tracking 22 characters in the interwar period, points out that for centuries, periods of prolonged war in Europe's violent history have been followed by periods of prolonged peace.""But once the generation with living memory of fighting had died, the next war came along,"" Mr. Schönpflug said. ""History teaches us that when the generation that experienced war dies out, caution diminishes and naiveté toward war increases.""""That means we have to be very careful today,"" he said.In 1918, the artist Paul Klee made ""The Comet of Paris,"" a tightrope walker hovering precariously in the air with a comet searing through the sky above and the Eiffel Tower below. What is unnerving about the image is that one cannot discern the rope even though one knows it is there.""It sums up where people were then, and in a way where we are today,"" said Mr. Schönpflug.No one knows what might come next. Europe has entered the unknown.In 1929, as it happened, people entered a murderous decade without even knowing.""That's what's so eerie looking back,"" said James Hawes, a historian and author of The Shortest History of Germany. ""Right up to 1931-32, no one realized what was about to happen. They thought they were just entering another decade.""What might future historians write about the Europe of 2018?Antony Beevor, author of a numerous best-selling history books, is pessimistic. The moral dilemmas of the future will undo European liberal democracy, he predicts. The migration crisis of 2015 was only a foretaste of what is to come.""Future waves of migration are inevitable and Europe is their main destination,"" Mr. Beevor said, pointing to the disruptive forces of poverty and climate change in developing countries as the main reasons.""European leaders will face the choice of turning back starving refugees or of handing ammunition to the far right and eroding the fabric in their own societies,"" he said.Others see it differently. Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says the biggest problem facing Europe is not populism but the incomplete currency union of the euro.""The major threat of Europe at the moment is not Orban or Salvini, the major threat is that the E.U.'s institutional arrangement is unstable,"" Mr. Ferguson said. Mr. Macron's ambition has been to fix that; but there is no consensus backing him.Whatever the future of Europe's institutions, one big difference from 100 years ago is that the Continent is no longer at the heart geopolitics.""A century ago, Europe was the center of the world -- even if it was the dark tragic center of the world,"" said Dominique Moïsi, a French author and thinker. ""Today we might be back to tragedy but not to centrality.""""History is moving elsewhere,"" he said.That, too, should be a motivation to shore up European integration, says the Reverend Musser in Alsace. One of his grandnieces is doing an internship in China, not Europe.Bones, bombs and bullets remain in the soil of Alsace, a region switched back and forth between various incarnations of France and Germany five times between the Thirty Years' War that ended in 1648 and the devastation of World War II.Local residents joke that Alsatians still keep German street signs in their basements, just in case.The Reverend Musser puts it this way: ""Alsace is a reminder of how much has been won in Europe -- and how much can be lost.""Credit: KATRIN BENNHOLD; Christopher F.

1531,1014285308.xml,"      BERLIN -- Thousands of people on Saturday marched through the heart of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital and the home of the European Central Bank, to protest against unchecked capitalism and Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence on austerity measures for much of Europe.    The peaceful event, called Blockupy, in a nod to the Occupy movement, was the culmination of four days of demonstrations and drew about 20,000 protesters to Frankfurt, the police and organizers said.   The protest, which drew supporters from across Europe, was meant to send a ""clear and visible signal of international solidarity against the authoritarian crisis management and the poverty inducing policies of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund,"" organizers said.    Germany has pushed for deep spending cuts across Europe to control the debt crisis.   Ms. Merkel faces mounting criticism for championing what critics regard as a rigid agenda of fiscal discipline that has made unfair demands on countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain.    Speaking from the Group of 8 meeting in the United States on Saturday, Ms. Merkel sought to play down criticism that she was solely focused on austerity, or consolidation, saying Germany would be open to increasing loans and credits to struggling nations through the European Investment Bank.   ""The important message is this: Consolidation and growth are the two sides of the same medallion,"" Ms. Merkel said, according to the German broadcaster ARD.       ",2012-05-20
2993,858627241.xml,"      OTTAWA -- On the same day earlier this month that the Canadian company Cameco, a global leader in uranium mining and processing, gathered its executives from around the world for a strategic planning session, news broke of Japan's staggering earthquake.    The accompanying tsunami, they learned, had swamped a Cameco customer: the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Suddenly, this strategy meeting would be anything but routine.   ""We had kind of a fortuitous convergence,"" said Gerald W. Grandey, the chief executive of Cameco, which held the meeting near its headquarters in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.   Fortuitous, but not fortunate -- for Cameco or the rest of the uranium industry, whose products fuel the world's nuclear power plants.    Over the last five years, uranium miners and processors -- and their stock prices -- have generally benefited from the assumption that rising energy demand in developing countries, and global concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, were creating a new appreciation for nuclear power industry.    Shares of Cameco had reached a recent high of $43.14 in mid-February, reflecting a steady rise from a low of $16 in October 2008. But since the tsunami, shares of Cameco have closed as low as $30.82, and closed Friday at $31.17.    Unusually rich ore deposits, particularly at Cameco's main deep-rock mine in northern Saskatchewan, help make it a low-cost producer. Uranium mining requires costly robotic systems and other measures to protect workers and the environment from radiation.   Cameco produces about 16 percent of the world's uranium supply and dominates the market, along with Areva, a French company with 17 percent of production, and the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, which also holds a 16 percent share. But compared with those more diversified companies, Cameco is essentially a pure-play uranium producer.   The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns that power plant, is not only a buyer of nuclear fuel from Cameco, among other suppliers. Tepco, as it is known, also holds a small stake in a Canadian mine that Cameco plans to open in 2013 as part of its goal to double production by 2018, which would make it the global leader in uranium.    Right now, most of the rest of the world is pausing to assess the future of its nuclear power programs. In Germany, a market for Cameco, Chancellor Angela Merkel has temporarily shut down seven nuclear plants and suspended a program for extending the life of aging reactors. And Italy, has suspended a plan to resume its nuclear power program, which it had stopped after the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl.    But for all that, Mr. Grandey said this week that he was still optimistic about the long-term future of nuclear power. He says he thinks the nuclear renaissance is only taking a temporary pause.    ""Even with Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and now Fukushima, nuclear still has an impeccable safety record,"" Mr. Grandey said in an interview. ""There will be in time -- I'm looking five, seven years -- a rapid acceleration of nuclear building putting us back on track to where we would have been, absent Fukushima.""    Not everyone, of course, shares Mr. Grandey's optimism, or his assessment of the industry's safety record. But there is no question that Cameco's future depends largely on the world's appetite for processed uranium after Fukushima.    Even if there is a global pullback on developing new power plants, Cameco has something of a cushion with its current customers. The company generally has multiyear contracts with utilities that require them to pay for fuel even if they do not accept delivery. (The company has suspended some contract terms for Tokyo Electric and another Japanese utility with reactors in the heavily damaged north, Tohoku Electric Power. Long-term Japan accounts for about 18 to 20 percent of Cameco's contracted sales.)   Farther out, Mr. Grandey bases his optimism on the inexorable rise in energy demand by developing economies like China and India, which have both indicated that they do not plan to curtail their ambitious rollout of new nuclear plants though they will proceed with a greater sense of caution. Fossil fuels, whether for environmental issues, supply constraints or price uncertainties, simply cannot meet the world's needs, he said.    ""It will take us six months a year to digest and learn the lessons of Fukushima,"" he said. ""After we digest the lessons learned, I think we'll get back on the path of nuclear construction.""   Joshua M. Pearce, a professor of mechanical and engineering at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, said that such analysis omitted an important factor.   ""This is not the 1950s when there was just nuclear and fossil fuels,"" he said, noting that alternative energy sources like solar and wind had become increasingly viable.   Professor Pearce was a co-author of a recent academic paper about indirect subsidies to nuclear power plants. He estimates that insurance liability caps granted to the American nuclear power industry, for example, produce an annual indirect subsidy of $33 million for every reactor in the United States.   He said that the liability costs to the Japanese government arising from Fukushima Daiichi, while still impossible to estimate, were presumably large, and might make other governments see that offering subsidies to renewable energy sources might be a comparative bargain.    Tony Ward, who heads Ernst & Young's power and utility practice in London, agrees that the current crisis will focus new attention on wind and solar power, particularly in China, which has already heavily invested in renewable energy technologies.   But Mr. Ward points to a significant limit to renewable energy as an alternative to nuclear. ""The supply chain is not sufficiently deep to provide the sheer scale of capacity that is sufficient,"" he said.   For Mr. Ward, one potential long-term change for Cameco stemming from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster is the issue of spent fuel storage -- which has been a big source of the trouble at that plant. He expects governments to reassess the economics of reprocessing nuclear waste into new fuel rather than allowing its continued storage.    But Cameco's Mr. Grandey, voicing optimism, insists that the nuclear industry's image will suffer no long-term harm.   ""The numbers that are questioning safety have gone up but that's inevitable,"" Mr. Grandy said. ""But it certainly can't be described as a mass change in attitude toward nuclear.""   He added: ""I think the public also understands that these are 35- and 40-year-old plants. So like airplanes that occasionally fall out of the sky, or like other industrial activities that experience disasters, every industry learns and improves.""

104,357050136.xml,"      BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel suffered a setback Thursday when her preferred candidate to be Germany's next president, Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen, lost the race after a leading conservative premier, Christian Wulff, was chosen by regional party leaders.    Mrs. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party had been rife with speculation over who would succeed Horst Kohler, who resigned unexpectedly Monday. The issue was decided after a meeting Thursday evening in Berlin with regional party leaders.   The choice of Mr. Wulff, 50, the ambitious premier of Lower Saxony, deals yet another blow to Mrs. Merkel and even undermines further her authority as leader of the Christian Democrats, said some party advisers.   ""Merkel has miscalculated her influence in the party,"" said a Christian Democrat who requested anonymity because the issue is so sensitive inside the party.    ""Von der Leyen was just too modern for the traditional, conservative wing of the Christian Democrats. Exactly like Merkel, von der Leyen did not cultivate the conservative wing, which is still immensely powerful inside the party.""   Mrs. Merkel already lost a key supporter when Roland Koch, the conservative premier of Hesse, resigned last month, saying he had had enough of politics. Mr. Koch, once seen as a challenger to Mrs. Merkel, was also an ally who was able to bolster the chancellor's support in the traditional wing of the Christian Democratic Union party.    Then this week, Mr. Kohler, a long-time ally of Mrs. Merkel's, resigned after the barrage of criticism he received over his remarks about the role of German soldiers serving abroad. He said they were there protecting Germany's economic interests.    By bringing together all the conservative premiers, Mrs. Merkel had wanted to end dissension and agree on a presidential candidate as soon as possible.    Mr. Kohler was chosen for a second term last year with just one vote to spare, an embarrassment for Mrs. Merkel, so this time she was seeking a candidate who would receive wider support when the vote is taken on June 30.    The German president is chosen by the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of Parliament, as well as an equal number of members elected by the Parliaments of the states, on the basis of proportional representation.   Dr. von der Leyen, 51, a physician with seven children, was considered a front runner earlier this week, so much so that she gained wide public support and enthusiastic backing from the influential newspaper Bild.    Dr. von der Leyen's previous post was family minister, from 2005 to 2009. During that time, the government pushed through changes aimed at expanding child care facilities so that women could return to work and gave generous financial benefits both to men and women who took leave from work to look after newborns.   Mr. Wulff, who has been premier of Lower Saxony since 2003, supports some of these issues, too.   But analysts say he has been careful never to polarize the party by pitting modernizers against traditional members.   Last month, in a bid to attract new voters, especially third generation Turks who were born in Germany, Mr. Wulff became the first state premier to bring into his cabinet a young, female politician with a Turkish background. Aygul Ozkan, 37 and secular Muslim, was appointed social affairs minister.    Mr. Wulff has not hidden his ambitions to become president. As soon as Mr. Kohler was re-elected last year, Mr. Wulff said he would be interested in the post when it came up again in 2013.    ""I would feel good as president,"" he said during a visit to the northern port of Cuxhaven in northern Germany.      This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

475,1967290714.xml,"THE HAGUE -- It was the closing of one of Europe's most shameful chapters of atrocity and bloodletting since World War II.With applause inside and outside the courtroom at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander, was convicted on Wednesday of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison.
It was the last major item of business for the tribunal in The Hague before it wound down, a full quarter-century after many of the crimes on its docket were committed.
From 1992 to 1995, the tribunal found, Mr. Mladic, 75, was the chief military organizer of the campaign to drive Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs off their lands to cleave a new homogeneous statelet for Bosnian Serbs.
The deadliest year of the campaign was 1992, when 45,000 people died, often in their homes, on the streets or in a string of concentration camps. Others perished in the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, where snipers and shelling terrorized residents for more than three years, and in the mass executions of 8,000 Muslim men and boys after Mr. Mladic's forces overran the United Nations-protected enclave of Srebrenica.
Sitting impassively at first in the court in a blue suit and tie, Mr. Mladic seemed much smaller than the burly commander in fatigues who had often appeared before the news media during the war to defend himself and his forces.
At one point, Mr. Mladic disappeared from the court, apparently to receive treatment for a dangerous surge in blood pressure. Upon returning, he began shouting at the court in a dispute over his blood pressure.
""Everything you are saying is a pure lie!"" he yelled at the bench. The judges then ordered him removed.
In pronouncing the life sentence, the presiding judge, Alphons Orie, said that Mr. Mladic's crimes ""rank among the most heinous known to humankind."" Mr. Mladic's lawyers said they would appeal.
But if Mr. Mladic's punishment drew a line of sorts -- juridically at least -- it was a halting and ambivalent marker between Europe's epochs of uncertainty.
Far from the quieted theaters of Balkan conflict, nationalist passions, the clamor for redrawn frontiers and collisions of faith are rising anew, not to the crump of mortar fire and the stutter of machine guns, but in the recharting of the political landscape.
In October, Austria became the latest European nation to veer to the right, following Hungary and Poland. In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany secured enough votes in national elections in September to enter Parliament for the first time. In many lands there is a sense of flux, from the secessionist yearnings of Catalonia in Spain to Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
Some of those passions are drawn from the angry response among Germans and other Europeans to Chancellor Angela Merkel's readiness to open Germany's frontiers to hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria and elsewhere -- many of whom passed through Serbia on their way north.
In Britain, many who voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union did so, they said, out of resentment of outsiders' influence over their destinies and the presence of what they saw as unchecked European immigrants.
In Serbia, calls are intensifying for a return to the nationalist politics of the 1990s. Once-discredited senior officials from the barbarous government of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade -- and not a few convicted war criminals -- are reclaiming positions of prominence.
There is a sense, too, of unfinished business and resentments that the war did not heal. Indeed, the trials of Mr. Mladic and others -- including his political boss, Radovan Karadzic, who was jailed for 40 years on almost identical charges last year, and Mr. Milosevic, who died in 2006 before the end of his trial -- may simply have intensified Serbia's rancorous perceptions of being treated unfairly and Muslims' sense of loss.
""Regardless of the verdict that we all feel as part of the campaign against Serbs, Ratko Mladic remains a legend of the Serb nation,"" said Milorad Dodik, the president of the Serb autonomous region in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was carved out and cleansed of non-Serbs by Mr. Mladic's wartime forces.
Sead Numanovic, a Bosnian journalist in Sarajevo who fought against Mr. Mladic's forces, said, ""This verdict, like all the others, will not bring back sons to their mothers, dead brothers to their sisters and husbands to their wives.""
The sense of victimhood among Serbs seemed to have been trumped on Wednesday by the sentencing of Mr. Mladic, which all but confirmed Bosnian Muslim resentments that the Serbs had succeeded in advancing their territorial ambitions by genocide.
""This should all have been behind us by now,"" said Hasan Nuhanovic, a Bosnian survivor of the Srebrenica massacre. ""The only thing that is behind us is that war.""
On both sides of the enduring ethnic divide, there was a feeling that the pronouncements of robed judges at The Hague will have no perceptible impact on the practicalities of eking out an existence in straitened times.
Bosnians in Sarajevo who once ran from snipers' bullets and sheltered from incessant indiscriminate shelling by Mr. Mladic's artillery units in the hills above the city have traded those perils for a dysfunctional government, joblessness and a collapsed social security and health system. (In The Hague on Wednesday, Judge Orie said Mr. Mladic had personally directed some of that deadly fire.)
In Belgrade, the crumbling socialist-era grandeur harks back to better times, when the city was the capital of a moderately developed Yugoslavia with a population of 22 million, rather than the impoverished republic it is today, among Europe's poorest.
Coupled with that struggle is a lingering memory not just of the war in Bosnia and Croatia of the early 1990s but also of the fighting later in the decade in what was then the southern Serbian province of Kosovo. To this day, banners in front of the Parliament building hold Bill and Hillary Clinton responsible for the widely resented 78-day NATO campaign that drove Serb-dominated forces out of Kosovo, enabling it to eventually declare independence in 2008.
Against that dim backdrop, Serbia is hoping to become the next member state of the European Union, although that would be in 2025 at the earliest.
Commenting on the outcome of the trial in The Hague, Natasa Kandic, a leading Serbian human rights activist, said that with the atrocities in the Bosnian war, ""we stopped being part of the civilized world.""
""Now we can see who stopped our progress and why we became a society without solidarity or compassion,"" Ms. Kandic said.
For advocates of human rights, the judgment -- the culmination of a trial that began in 2012 only to be interrupted by Mr. Mladic's health problems -- was historic.
The United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, called it as ""a momentous victory for justice"" and declared that ""Mladic is the epitome of evil.""
Mr. Mladic had left a compelling trail, recording his meetings and telephone conversations with military officials, politicians or foreign envoys. They were discovered behind a false wall in Mr. Mladic's home; included in that cache were 18 notebooks of his wartime diaries, an extraordinary windfall, prosecutors said.
It was also the first trial in which prosecutors presented evidence from recently explored mass graves around an open-pit mine at Tomasica, near Prijedor in northern Bosnia, where Muslims were herded into concentration camps, tortured, raped and killed during the ethnic cleansing campaign.
The International Commission on Missing Persons, which uses DNA testing, said this month that so far 656 bodies from the mine have been identified, among the nearly 6,000 people reported missing around Prijedor in the summer of 1992.
More bodies are emerging, including remains that were moved to other graves to hide the magnitude of the crime.
Mr. Mladic's diary notes a request in 1992 from Simo Drljaca, the Prijedor police chief, asking for the army's help to remove about 5,000 bodies buried in Tomasica by ""burning them or grinding them or in any other way.""
Mr. Mladic wrote that he replied: ""You killed them, you bury them.""

3750,433699952.xml,"      The world's leading finance ministers called Friday for a joint effort to set up guidelines for government-owned investment funds to make sure their investment strategies are clear and conform to sound business standards. The measure stemmed from concern about plans by Russia, China and the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East to buy up companies, banks and real estate in the West.   In a communique issued Friday evening, the ministers said that cross-border investment was generally ''a major contributor to robust global growth'' but it asked that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the organization that represents advanced industrial countries participate in setting rules of conduct when the investors are governments themselves. In another development, the finance ministers for the first time explicitly called on China to bring about a rise in the value of its currency, a step that might make exports from China more expensive and imports less expensive. The call for a code of ''best practices'' for government-owned investment funds was seen as a veiled warning to countries not to use their investments to influence the political climate in the countries in which they invest, nor to invest with political motives in mind, for instance, by trying to control a sector of the economy in a rival country. The statement referred to such practices as ''risk management'' and ''accountability.'' It appeared to reflect mounting anxiety in Europe, especially, that Russian investments were aimed at controlling more of the region's energy infrastructure. David H. McCormick, under secretary of Treasury for international affairs, said this week that best practices also meant the avoidance of political influence in any investment decision. Following the communique, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. held a private dinner for the  finance ministers in what he and others described as a process to reach out for the first time to the managers of government-owned ''sovereign wealth funds,'' which experts say now control up to $2.5 billion in investments. Morgan Stanley and other analysts say the government funds could grow to $17.5 billion in the next 10 years, making them major players on the international economic scene and possibly major players in countries where they own assets. The finance ministers' statement did not name any countries, but officials said it was directed at China, Russia and other countries that have started using revenue from oil and other exports to buy stakes in Western companies. The concern in Europe and the United States is that these purchases could provoke a backlash. Mr. Paulson was the host of the meeting among finance ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan as they met Friday afternoon. All were in Washington for annual meetings sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The weekend of meetings was to focus on concerns among the scores of finance ministers and central bankers about the precarious state of the world economy, and the lack of transparency in some markets that appear to have damped investor confidence. Also on the agenda is the concern in Europe about the decline of the dollar against the euro, which has hampered European exports, and the American and European criticism of what they say is China's deliberate policy of using an undervalued currency to promote exports. The finance ministers' message Friday evening repeated the recent predictions of many economic experts that the severe troubles in the housing sector in the United States ''will likely moderate'' the growth of the global economy. ''Nevertheless, our overall economic fundamentals continue to be strong,'' the ministers said, adding that growth in ''emerging markets'' -- a reference to China, India, Brazil and other developing countries -- were still providing ''critical impetus to the strength of the world economy.'' But in a sign of the growing importance of sovereign wealth funds, the Western finance ministers were planning to have dinner Friday night with representatives of the funds from Russia, China, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and other countries. The call for a voluntary code of ''best practices'' stopped short of saying that countries should not invest with political motivations in mind. Officials involved in drafting the communique said there was a concern that it not be seen as ''bashing'' Russia, China, Saudi Arabia or other investing governments. The Bush administration has for months called for a voluntary code of conduct and previously asked for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help draw one up. But the bank and the fund have resisted the request to go beyond a call for sound investment and asset management strategies. Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said this week that it was not the bank's role to tell countries not to exercise what they determine to be their own national interest in making investments. ''That's a question of national judgment,'' Mr. Zoellick said, noting that the United States, Canada and Germany had set up their own entities to bar investments that might damage their national security and that these decisions should be left to governments. So far American officials say they see no evidence of sovereign wealth funds exercising political decisions through their investments, but there is concern in Europe about Russia's use of its sovereign wealth funds and its government-owned oil companies buying pipelines and other energy infrastructure in Europe. While Russia sees such purchases as enhancing its energy security, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and others are concerned that Russia might try to coerce Europe on political decisions by using its oil power, much as it did during the crises of a couple years ago in Ukraine.

2441,433377554.xml,"      Lech Walesa, the hero of the Solidarity movement and former president now adrift in this political backwater, sat back in his office atop this city's historic Green Gate to reminisce about another Lech who worked for him years ago. ''His approach is to first destroy and then think about what to build,'' Mr. Walesa said of the country's current president, Lech Kaczynski, who served as Mr. Walesa's national security chief.  That sums up a growing consensus that has rippled across this still fledgling democracy in the days since Mr. Kaczynski appointed his twin brother, Jaroslaw, to the post of prime minister earlier this month. Many Poles see the twins' leadership as consolidating a shift toward right-wing, nationalist politics that has polarized the country between older, less educated rural voters who elected Mr. Kaczynski and the younger, educated urban voters who largely oppose him. Already, President Kaczynski had alienated Germany and strained relations with the European Union. He has nearly stopped the government's privatization program and has concentrated on a parliamentary commission to reassess privatization and banking practices since the end of Communist rule here 17 years ago. His current focus is lustration, the process of exposing former Communist Party collaborators and rooting them from positions of power. ''They concentrate on the past,'' said Marek Ostrowski, an editor at the Polish weekly magazine Polityka. ''The future seems to be not so important for them.'' A poll this month by the daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza found just 21 percent of people questioned saw Jaroslaw Kaczynski's appointment as a positive move. The Kaczynski twins were born to a World War II resistance fighter and a philologist 57 years ago and got an early taste of celebrity as child film actors. They look so much alike that to tell them apart people look for a mole that Lech Kaczynski has on his left cheek. They say their hero is Jozef Pilsudski, the Polish field marshal who resurrected the Polish state in 1918, but later, disillusioned with partisan quarrels, seized power in a 1926 coup and ruled as dictator until his death in 1935. The Polish press has made much of the inevitable comparisons. Many people see the appointment of President Kaczynski's brother as prime minister as a step toward the so-called Fourth Republic that the twin brothers have said they want to build. The Fourth Republic would purge former Communists from the corridors of power and concentrate power in the hands of the president. They lack the two-thirds parliamentary majority required for the constitutional changes that would make that dream a reality, but securing the presidency and the prime minister's job comes close to the same thing. Since Lech Kaczynski became president in December 2005, he has spent much of his energy on consolidating control of Poland's major state-owned enterprises. Early this year, he sparked a public outcry with the appointment of Jaromir Netzel, a Gdansk lawyer with no experience running a large company, to head the country's biggest insurer, PZU. The ambitious electoral program that helped bring Mr. Kaczynski to power, meanwhile, has been mostly forgotten. He promised to build three million apartments in the next eight years, for example, but now says that is up to private enterprise. Foreign relations stand to suffer the most from Mr. Kaczynski's tenure, observers say. The president canceled two major foreign visits earlier this month, one to Britain and the other a summit meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Jacques Chirac of France, citing unexplained health problems. Many Poles believe that the cancellations were more likely a case of diplomatic flu. The cancellation of the three-way summit meeting came after a German newspaper lampooned the twins as the ''new Polish potatoes'' and said that the only thing Lech Kaczynski knew about Germany was ''the spittoon in the men's toilet at Frankfurt Airport.'' He has demanded an apology from the government. Relations with the European Union, meanwhile, have been strained over Poland's resistance to cross-border takeovers of its big companies. Many people are wondering if the twins had a hand in the sudden downfall of Zyta Gilowska, deputy prime minister and finance minister, who resigned last month after a new public prosecutor started an investigation into her possible links with the Communists' secret police. The investigation was stopped as soon as Ms. Gilowska resigned. It is unclear on what evidence the investigation was started, but many Poles see the case as an example of how lustration can be abused. ''I didn't like their constant conspiracy theories, always suspecting people, always involved in intrigues,'' said Mr. Walesa, his signature mustache now snowy white. He fired both brothers -- Jaroslaw Kaczynski was a senior adviser -- in 1993. Despite the concerns about their policies, Mr. Walesa said that the brothers would not have time to do much damage because a free press and nongovernmental organizations would keep them in check until new elections in less than four years. ''Democracy is working,'' Mr. Walesa said. ''If they threaten that, they will be taught a lesson.''

3737,868593948.xml,"      BERLIN -- Mario Draghi received a warm welcome Wednesday in his first public appearance in Germany since being officially nominated to become the next president of the European Central Bank.    Invited by the economy council of the governing Christian Democratic Union party, Mr. Draghi warned at an economics conference about the perils of inflation as the world recovered from the global financial crisis.    His remarks won repeated applause from nearly 1,000 audience members, most of them company executives who have been critical of Chancellor Angela Merkel's economic policies.    Mr. Draghi, governor of the Italian central bank, was nominated this month at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as European Central Bank president in October, when Mr. Trichet's term ends. Mr. Draghi will need to be endorsed by European Union leaders, but that is considered a formality.    His candidacy has been the subject of strident commentary in the German news media, which has asserted that a banker from a south European country would be unsuited for a job that demanded fiscal and monetary discipline.    Even Mrs. Merkel, who was one of the government leaders in the euro zone countries to withhold support from Mr. Draghi at the early stages of his candidacy, only recently spoke out in favor of him.    Mr. Draghi's advisers said it was not certain that he and Mrs. Merkel would meet because of scheduling conflicts. Mr. Draghi was to return to Italy late Wednesday afternoon. Mrs. Merkel, in Paris for meetings at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, was to return to Berlin on Wednesday night to address the same conference.    During his 20-minute keynote address, Mr. Draghi said the recovery of the world economy was continuing, with overall gross domestic product expected to expand 4.4 percent this year, and 6.5 percent in emerging countries.    ""However, the crisis is not over,"" he warned. ""While global growth has been gathering robustness, it is very uneven.""    Turning to the euro zone countries, Mr. Draghi said it was crucial in a monetary union that each member country satisfy three conditions: price stability, fiscal discipline and national economic policies conducive to growth.    The first condition ""was and is ensured by the E.C.B,"" Mr. Draghi said, ""but in some countries, we do not have the second and the third. The primary responsibility for a response to a lack of confidence must be national.""    Underscoring the interdependence of euro zone countries, he noted that the sovereign debt crisis of three countries -- which he did not name -- whose combined gross domestic product amounted to about 6 percent of the total euro zone G.D.P. held ""the potential to have a big systemic impact.""    In a specific reference to German industrialists, he said that, ""with the notable exception of Germany,"" economic growth ""remains feeble in the advanced countries, too slow to help redress seriously weakened fiscal balances and unemployment rates.""    In emerging countries, Mr. Draghi said, ""there are signs of overheating, with large capital inflows carrying a heightened potential for disruption. Commodity and oil prices have been under heavy upward pressure.""    Mario Draghi Addressed Leaders at an Economic Council in Berlin On Wednesday.

1765,1862473312.xml,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump began a new era of diplomacy with Russia on Saturday as he and President Vladimir V. Putin conducted an hourlong telephone call, and vowed to repair relations between the countries after nearly three years of conflict that threatened a new Cold War between East and West.The two leaders discussed fighting terrorism and expanding economic ties, but barely mentioned the wedge that has been driven between Washington and Moscow since Russia annexed Crimea and sponsored a separatist war in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Still, although Mr. Trump had previously expressed a willingness to lift sanctions against Russia, the issue did not come up, according to officials on both sides.
The tone of the conversation was reported to be warm, indicating a drastic shift after relations had broken down between Mr. Putin and former President Barack Obama. ""The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,"" the Trump administration said in a statement. ""Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today's call, the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.""
In its statement, the Kremlin said: ""Donald Trump asked to convey a desire for happiness and prosperity for the Russian people, noting that the people in America relate with sympathy to Russia and its citizens."" Mr. Putin answered that Russians feel the same way about Americans, the statement said. Neither side mentioned the Russian hacking of the American election in their statements.
Over the past two days, Mr. Trump has also had a series of conversations with the United States' traditional European allies, but those calls were seemingly not as congenial. After a meeting on Friday with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, in which she warned against removing sanctions on Russia, Mr. Trump had on Saturday what appeared to be a businesslike call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and a testier call with President François Hollande of France.
Mr. Hollande's office said the French president pressed Mr. Trump not to lift sanctions against Russia and to respect the nuclear agreement with Iran. He asserted the importance of the Paris climate change pact, warned of the consequences of protectionism, and added that democratic values included welcoming refugees -- all in reaction to Mr. Trump's first week of policy moves. Mr. Hollande also emphasized the importance of NATO and the United Nations, both of which Mr. Trump has disparaged.
The call came just hours after Mr. Hollande, at a conference in Lisbon, said that European countries had to stand together against Mr. Trump, and assert their common values.
""We have to be conscious of the responsibility we have,"" he told reporters, according to Agence France-Presse. ""Europe is a force, Europe is a guarantee, Europe is protection, and Europe is also a space for liberty and democracy.""
Ms. Merkel, who has reacted coolly to Mr. Trump's rise, emphasized the importance of NATO in their own 45-minute call with the president on Saturday. The two sides later released similar statements affirming the American commitment to the alliance, even as they noted that allies needed to increase their contributions, as Mr. Trump has demanded.
But the tone was spare and lacked warmth. That the statements included a description of what has been a cornerstone of policy for decades illustrated just how rattled trans-Atlantic relations have been since Mr. Trump dismissed NATO as ""obsolete"" shortly before his inauguration.
Mr. Trump's conversation with Mr. Putin was their first direct discussion since the inauguration a week ago and aimed at setting the groundwork for a possible meeting.
American intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia made a concerted effort -- through hacking, propaganda and other means -- to influence the November election in favor of Mr. Trump, a conclusion Mr. Trump initially refused to accept until he received a detailed briefing. Intelligence officials also briefed both Mr. Obama and his successor on a mysterious dossier compiled by political foes of Mr. Trump that included unsubstantiated claims that Russia had collected compromising information on the future president.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reviewed an intercepted postelection conversation between Michael T. Flynn, now the national security adviser to Mr. Trump, and Sergei I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. American authorities are also examining possible links between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump, including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
Mr. Trump's phone call with Mr. Putin came after news reports in Moscow that two Russian intelligence officers who had worked on cyberoperations, as well as a Russian computer security expert, had been arrested on treason charges. One of the Federal Security Service officers detained has been accused of providing information to the United States, according to Novaya Gazeta, a Russian opposition newspaper.
The United States and Europe have imposed an array of sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and for human rights abuses at home. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for that country's interference in American elections. Lifting them, critics said, would cause a rift between the United States and Europe.
""That's going to lead to disunity and exactly what Putin wants,"" said Michael McFaul, who served as ambassador to Russia under Mr. Obama. ""What could be better for him? Not only the act of sanctions' being lifted but the process of disunity and disarray within the European Union. That's a giant gift to him.""
Senate Republicans may have slowed Mr. Trump on sanctions after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he would favor bipartisan legislation requiring that sanctions stay in place. Mr. Trump tried to play down the prospect at a news conference with Mrs. May on Friday, saying it was ""very early to be talking about"" sanctions relief. But he did not disavow it, and government officials said there had been discussion of what to do on sanctions since Mr. Trump's team took over.
Joining Mr. Trump in the Oval Office for his phone call with Mr. Putin was Vice President Mike Pence; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president's chief strategist; Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary; and Mr. Flynn.
The Kremlin said the two leaders talked about the Middle East, including the Syrian civil war; the Islamic State; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and Iran's nuclear program, although it gave no specifics. North Korea and strategic nuclear arms came up, as did ""key aspects of the Ukraine crisis,"" the statement said.
""It was agreed to cooperate on these and other issues,"" the Russian statement said, ""but the priority was placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat -- international terrorism.""
But an American official, who was briefed on the call but not authorized to discuss it publicly, said Ukraine did not come up in any real detail, and sanctions did not come up at all.
Still, a leading member of Russia's Parliament, Dmitri Novikov, said that mention of bolstering trade ties suggested that sanctions relief was coming. ""To fully develop economic ties, it's necessary to create the right climate and legal conditions, and that requires canceling sanctions,"" he told the Interfax news agency.
Others seemed to be expecting the same. Soon after the call, a Russian government investment fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, announced it had arranged more than 10 projects it hoped could draw American investment to Russia, and that it planned to open an office in New York in May.
Mr. Trump also spoke on Saturday with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. He invited Mr. Abe to visit the White House on Feb. 10. ""President Trump affirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to ensuring the security of Japan,"" the administration said in a statement, a commitment that had been in doubt among some in Tokyo after some of Mr. Trump's statements during the campaign.

",2017-01-29
792,1642113798.xml,"       DRESDEN, Germany --  Defying appeals from an array of German institutions to stay away from anti-immigration rallies, some 18,000 people took part in a protest here on Monday, parading against what they call the Islamization of Europe and putting pressure on the authorities to defuse social tensions.  The turnout more or less equaled that of late December, before Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans in her New Year's address to shun the rallies and their organizers, who she said had ""prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts."" The latest protest illustrated the depth of the challenge faced by the establishment and the many Germans who see their country as open and even eager to give shelter to refugees from Mideast wars and bolster the labor force with immigrants. Several thousand people turned out in Berlin to counter the several hundred who had formed an anti-immigration rally. A few thousand also countered the equally sparse anti-immigration crowd in Cologne. In Berlin, Martin Küper, 31, said he was ""disgusted"" at the idea that a German would protest against people who ""had already been threatened by death and deportation in their home countries.""  In gestures intended to deny anti-immigration protesters picturesque backdrops for their rallies, the church and city authorities in Cologne and Berlin switched off the illumination at three of the country's best-known landmarks: the Cologne Cathedral and, in Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate and the TV tower at Alexanderplatz. In Dresden, where about 3,000 people staged a counterdemonstration, the group known as Pegida -- the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West -- was confined to a park and a march around a nearby stadium. Ironically, the park is named the Cockerwiese after the late rock singer Joe Cocker, who gave a concert there in 1988, during Communist rule, and whose trademark song was ""With a Little Help from My Friends."" Monday night's rally, held in a cold rain, yielded nothing new in the way of sentiment from the speakers, whose group insists that it wants to help refugees, but is against asylum abusers, foreigners who mooch off Germany and what it sees as a creeping Islamization of society. But the mention of Ms. Merkel's name drew boos, and several people interviewed -- typically declining to give their names to reporters -- said her criticism of Pegida had disqualified her as a leader. Earlier on Monday, business leaders joined the swelling chorus against Pegida from established political parties, the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, social groups and even anonymous jokesters who set up a spoof ""Snowgida"" page on Facebook. Ingo Kramer, head of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, said, ""Germany's image as a business location is being damaged by the impression that we are demonstrating against foreigners."" ""We need immigration for our labor market and to allow our social system to function,"" he added in a statement. The fear of foreigners, especially Muslims, threatening or drowning out national and regional identities forged over centuries seems to have a growing pull in Europe, where populists and nationalists scored record gains in elections in May for the European Parliament. Since reuniting in 1990, Germany has experienced outbursts of racist violence directed against foreigners, often in the east, where barely 1 percent of the population was non-German in Communist times. In recent years, however, the Germans have offered asylum liberally, beginning with refugees of the Balkan wars of the early 1990s. The nation's Nazi past is often cited as a reason to offer sanctuary, but that has worn thin recently because of an influx of about 200,000 asylum seekers last year -- four times the total for 2012 -- and the strain of housing so many people. An anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, is flirting with anti-foreigner sentiment and won seats in three state legislatures in eastern Germany in the fall. While its leaders are bickering furiously, at least some have attended the Dresden rallies and are willing to meet with Pegida. Across the established political spectrum, debate has raged about whether to engage directly with Pegida, as well as how to confront its clear appeal to a disgruntled segment of the German population. Its supporters include far rightists, neo-Nazis and soccer hooligans, as well as a larger number of average citizens who seem worried about losing status, even if -- in Dresden and the surrounding state of Saxony -- barely 2 percent of residents are foreigners and even fewer are Muslims. On Tuesday, the country's best-selling newspaper, Bild, headlined articles with ""The People Are Stopping Pegida"" and highlighted efforts to support immigration. Berthold Kohler, a publisher of the influential center-right newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, noted Monday in a commentary titled ""Terribly Simple"" that, despite Ms. Merkel's stand against the Pegida movement, it was clear that her coalition government of center-right and center-left was still trying to figure out what to do. The movement, he said, is ""the tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to a loss of faith in elites or institutions across the board. Ms. Merkel's partners in her conservative bloc, the Bavarian Christian Social Union, plan to debate what they call ""a fair and balanced asylum policy"" at a meeting this week. That policy would involve a swifter processing of asylum requests and deportation of abusers, portraying this as the only way to continue guaranteeing a welcome for hundreds of thousands of legitimate refugees, particularly from Syria and Iraq. ""People are reacting to the situation with much understanding, empathy and remarkable voluntary engagement,"" the party said in the proposal. All who are helping should be thanked, it added, ""for they are the face of modern Germany, open to the world."" Among the many voices discussing Pegida were the writer Peter Schneider, who over the weekend published his impressions of a visit to the last Pegida rally on Dec. 22. ""For my taste,"" Mr. Schneider wrote in the newspaper Die Welt, ""the crowd was too white.""  He also noted that any number of issues -- like Islamic State jihadists, Palestinian immigrants voicing anti-Semitism, or European women opposing Muslim attitudes toward women -- deserved to be discussed in Germany and elsewhere in Europe where large numbers of immigrants live.  The answer certainly does not lie in declining dialogue with Pegida or its supporters, Mr. Schneider wrote. ""If political correctness means that facts can no longer be called by their name,"" he concluded, ""then society is robbing itself of a viable future.""

3311,2598340198.xml,"President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, whom the E.U. accuses of engineering a migrant crisis on the border with Poland, could face a serious headache if asylum seekers try to stay in his country.BRUZGI, Belarus -- He has ruled with an iron fist for 27 years, surviving huge street protests, multiple rounds of Western sanctions and even alleged plots by his benefactor, Russia, to remove him.But a threat President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko has never before had to contend with is now taking shape in a squalid migrant encampment along his country's border with Poland. Having helped funnel desperate migrants to Europe's doorstep, Mr. Lukashenko suddenly has to deal with people like Bale Nisu, a 21-year-old Kurd from Iraq who has taken a liking to Belarus, and would like to settle here.Many of the more than 2,000 people marooned on the Belarusian side of the razor wire at Bruzgi, a large, shuttered border crossing, insist they won't give up on trying to get into the European Union. But growing fears that they might instead get sent back to their home countries has made Mr. Nisu and others wonder whether staying put in Belarus could be their best option.""I want to go to Germany, but if that is impossible, I'll just stay here,"" Mr. Nisu said Wednesday after moving into a big warehouse near the border that has been converted into a migrant holding center by the Belarusian authorities in an effort to release pressure on the border -- and burnish the country's often grim image.He lamented that he had spent more than $4,000 and days freezing in the forest only to end up in a poor, highly repressive former Soviet republic with little to offer in the way of jobs and other opportunities.But, showing rips in his pants, which he maintained were caused by Polish security forces beating him up after an abortive attempt to sneak across the frontier last week, he said that Belarus looked far more enticing than returning to Iraq, or more encounters with Polish soldiers and border guards. He said he wanted to apply for asylum in Belarus.""Belarus,"" he said, ""is a very, very good country.""Dictators don't usually have to worry about having their country praised, but Mr. Lukashenko, often described as ""Europe's last dictator,"" could face a serious headache if migrants start demanding political asylum in Belarus. It is a predominantly Orthodox Christian nation with scant experience of taking in foreign immigrants and, like Poland and other East European countries, has been generally hostile to non-Christian settlers from outside Europe.Belarus has spent weeks denouncing Poland for violating international law by refusing to consider asylum requests and pushing back migrants -- mostly people fleeing poverty but some of whom have legitimate claims to asylum as refugees from war or persecution -- who make it across the border.But what Belarus presents as a humanitarian crisis is viewed by the European Union as the front line in a ""hybrid war"" engineered by Mr. Lukashenko to pressure Europe into lifting sanctions imposed after a contested presidential election last year.After clashes at the Bruzgi crossing point on Tuesday, Polish forces massed just a few yards from the migrant encampment bombarded the Belarusian side with a recorded message giving a stern warning in English, which few of the migrants understand: ""If you don't follow orders, force may be used against you.""Scores of migrants on Wednesday again pushed toward the razor wire that marks the frontier but did not break through. As evening fell, Polish border guards were uncoiling yet more razor wire near the spot where migrants briefly broke through on Tuesday.With hope of getting into Poland and then Germany draining away, desperate parents sent a group of young girls to the razor wire to plead with Polish guards glowering just yards away. ""I love you Poland,"" they shouted in English. ""Please Help Me. Please open the door.""Jangi Rasul, a 36-year-old Iraqi Kurd, said he felt sorry for the Polish forces. ""They are freezing like we are and are just following orders they get from politicians playing games,"" he said.Mr. Rasul sleeps in a small flimsy tent with his wife and three young children -- they have only one sleeping bag -- and said he was desperate to move on as the money he raised by selling the family's car and furniture in Sulaimaniya, a city in northern Iraq, had nearly run out. He waved what he said was all he has left: 200 Belarusian rubles, about $80.With Poland's defense minister declaring on Wednesday that his country would fight ""for months, if not years"" to keep out migrants, the prospects for those hoping to enter the European Union through Belarus dimmed further and left Mr. Lukashenko with a dilemma: what to do with the thousands of people his country has allowed in but who now can't get out?On a visit to Warsaw last month, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled leader of the Belarus opposition, said that between 10,000 to 15,000 migrants had already arrived in her country and would become ""a huge problem for Lukashenko"" if they got stuck in Belarus.""He has to deal with all these people somehow,"" she said.It is not clear where those numbers stand now, but they have clearly been growing rapidly over the past month, though the flow has slowed considerably in recent days as airlines halted flights to Minsk, the Belarusian capital, or barred passengers from selected countries like Iraq, Syria and Yemen.Asked how Belarus would respond to requests for asylum, Yuri Karayev, a former interior minister who is now an aide to Mr. Lukashenko responsible for the border region of Grodno, expressed surprise on Wednesday that anyone would really want to settle in Belarus. He said he did not know how the government would respond to asylum requests.""I'm of course happy if people like it here, but what happens depends on a decision from the president,"" he said in an interview during a visit to the newly opened holding center for migrants just outside the Bruzgi border zone.Mr. Karayev dismissed accusations by the European Union that Belarus had orchestrated the migrant crisis, saying that people had arrived from countries like Iraq of their own accord, flying in on tourist visas that entitled them to roam around the country at will. ""We have nothing to do with this crisis,"" he said.He said the government was trying to ease tensions by moving migrants from the border fence. The real culprit, he said, is German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who declared her country open to migrants in 2015.Around 1,100 people, Mr. Karayev said, have already moved to the new holding center. The 800 or so remaining in an encampment that migrants call ""the jungle"" will be urged to join them in the warehouse, where there is food, bedding, electricity for people to charge their phones and shelter from the biting cold.Dariya Ibrahim Mohammed, one of those who agreed to move, said he was distraught ""after spending so much money and only getting frozen."" He said he would request asylum in Belarus if that was the only way to avoid getting sent back to Iraq.Another Iraqi, Shajwan Mohammed, said she would like to stay in Belarus with her husband if the doors to the European Union remain closed. Exhausted after nearly a month on the road, much of it in the forests that straddle the border with Poland, she said Belarus was not her first choice but ""it is much better than going back to Iraq.""Migrants offer different accounts of the role played by Belarusian security officials in the crisis. Some say they were led to weak points in the border fence and even provided with wires cutters. Others say they organized their own forays into Poland with no help from Belarus.Aso Ahmed, a 25-year-old Kurd from Iraq, said he had joined two attempts to storm the border en masse, the more recent of which on Tuesday led to violent clashes with Polish border guards, who unleashed water cannons and tear gas after being pelted with stones and debris. The efforts, he said, were organized by the migrants, not the Belarusians. ""They were not part of it,"" he said.Mr. Ahmed, fearing a ruse aimed at gathering people together for deportation to Iraq, has refused to leave the encampment next to the border fence and move to the brick warehouse a few hundreds yards away. ""It is a trap,"" he said. ""If I get deported I might as well be dead.""Waiting for tea being served by the Belarusian Red Cross on Wednesday.

2725,1863330824.xml," President Trump is bringing his top two candidates for the Supreme Court to the White House on Tuesday, adding to the tension ahead of his prime-time court announcement. Networks will give Mr. Trump the show he wants, cutting into prime-time programming to broadcast his Supreme Court choice.
 The Border Patrol gets a new chief, drawn from its own ranks.
You're hired. (You're fired.)
It's ""The Apprentice, SCOTUS Edition.""
Mr. Trump, who has a penchant for the theatrical and loved teasing out suspense in his key appointments throughout the campaign, plans to bring his two top choices for the United States Supreme Court to the White House ahead of his announcement tonight at 8 p.m., according to a CNN report.
The two judges, Neil M. Gorsuch and Thomas M. Hardiman, are traveling to Washington this afternoon, the report said. The move is highly unusual for Washington, where Supreme Court announcements are treated with solemn gravity. But it is very familiar for Mr. Trump, who was the original star of the reality television show ""The Apprentice"" and who used to produce beauty pageants.
Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about which way he is leaning. Judge Hardiman has been recommended by Mr. Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who is a federal judge. But Judge Gorsuch has strong supporters.
The Trump administration is also mindful of making a choice that would be seen as moderate enough that Justice Anthony Kennedy, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, could feel comfortable with retiring in the next few years, opening up another seat for the current president to fill.
Judge Gorsuch was a clerk for Mr. Kennedy.
And here are your contenders. To mix our reality television show metaphors, who will end up with the rose?
Trump wants a big show for his Supreme Court rollout. Networks oblige
The major broadcast networks are set to carry President Trump's Supreme Court announcement live on Tuesday evening, cutting into regular prime-time programming.
The coverage by ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox broadcast affiliates is likely to significantly expand the television audience for the president's announcement, which has taken on the air of a reality television special. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter account to encourage Americans to tune in for the event.
I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M. (W.H.) -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017
Typically, the introduction of a Supreme Court nominee occurs during the daytime, when viewership is relatively lower. The major cable-news networks also plan to carry tonight's announcement live.
The border patrol gets a new chief
The Customs and Border Protection agency announced on Tuesday that Ronald Vitiello, an executive assistant commissioner and long-time insider at the agency, has been named the new chief of the Border Patrol.
Mr. Vitiello's elevation to head the 93-year old agency comes nearly a week days after Mark Morgan, who had been chief since October 2016, was asked to step down by the Trump administration.
Mr. Morgan's last day was Tuesday. Mr. Morgan, a former F.B.I. agent, was appointed chief in June and took over in October. He was the first chief in the agency's history that had never worked as a border patrol agent. He had led the internal affairs office at Customs and Border Protection before taking over the Border Patrol.
His appointment drew criticism from the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol workers, which said an insider should have been appointed to head the agency.
The union endorsed Mr. Trump during the election, and the union's president, Brandon Judd, also served on Mr. Trump's transition team.
Trump greets drug makers with a carrot and a stick
President Trump, who just weeks ago accused the pharmaceutical industry of ""getting away with murder,"" demanded on Tuesday that major drug companies lower their prices and return operations to the United States. But he vowed to help them by shredding regulations and leveling the playing field with foreign countries.
Mr. Trump gathered the heads of pharmaceutical companies in the Roosevelt Room for what has become a regular feature of his first days in the White House: a meeting with corporate leaders, at which the president holds forth on an pet issue for the television cameras.
On drug pricing, the president has aligned himself with Democrats, who have long argued that the government should be allowed to bargain for lower drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid, a position fought tooth and nail by Republicans. But Mr. Trump was diplomatic, at least for the cameras.
""The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons.""
""We're also going to be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,"" he added.
Much of his message had to do with luring corporate investment back to the United States. He promised that the Food and Drug Administration would speed its approval of new drugs. And he said the United States would end ""foreign freeloading,"" which he described as countries devaluing their currencies to undercut the competitiveness of the American market.
""Because our country has been run so badly, we know nothing about devaluation,"" he said. ""You look at what China's doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market, while we sit here like a bunch of dummies.""
China's currency has actually been appreciating of late, and Japan has not intentionally manipulated its currency values for several years.
Amid executive branch chaos, Trump calls Democrats 'a mess'
The acting attorney general has been fired, protests are rocking the nation's largest airports, and a constitutional clash is brewing between the executive and judicial branches, but Mr. Trump thinks the Democrats are a real mess because their audio equipment malfunctions, as do their tear ducts.
Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017
The rally he was referring to was surprisingly large for what amounted to a political event on the steps of the Supreme Court. But what is really sticking in the president's craw is the glacial pace of confirmations in the Senate -- which is intentional. His choice for transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, is likely to be confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, and his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, will probably get a vote on Wednesday. Committee votes are expected today for his nominees for attorney general, Jeff Sessions and small business administrator, Linda McMahon. The Senate Education Committee voted out the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary on a party-line vote.
But Democrats are deliberately slowing the process as they demand more answers to questions about ethics and the nominees' views on Mr. Trump's temporary immigration ban from citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations.
When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet! They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017
Mr. Trump's tweets only gave Democratic leaders the opportunity to grab the high ground. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, responded:
""The mic briefly didn't work, but this thin-skinned President clearly heard the voices of the more than 250 Members of Congress and thousands of others who gathered outside the Supreme Court last night. The President's immoral executive order is clearly unconstitutional -- no matter how many times he tweets or how many Administration officials he fires.""
So did Mr. Schumer's spokesman, Matt House:
""President Trump should learn that name calling is not going to solve the many problems this administration has already brought upon itself. He ought to repeal this un-American, poorly put-together, and rushed executive order that makes America less safe and figure out a real way to stop terrorism.""
Democrats boycott committee vote to slow Trump nominees
Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee sought to stall the confirmations of Steven Mnuchin and Tom Price, Mr. Trump's picks for Treasury secretary and secretary of health and human Services, refusing to attend scheduled votes on Tuesday.
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said that recent news reports suggested that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings and that the committee members needed more information before making judgments about the nominees.
""We have made clear that we need additional information,"" Mr. Wyden said outside of his office, explaining the reason for the boycott.
Republicans expressed dismay at the delay. But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its 12-month point after an unprecedented blockade by Republicans, Democrats weren't exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet.
Showdown at Justice Dept. raises heat on Senate
The late-night firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, over her refusal to defend Mr. Trump's executive order banning refugees, immigrants and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has put a lot of people in a sticky position: senators.
Democrats now have every reason to drag out the confirmation fight over Mr. Sessions as long as possible, leaving Mr. Trump's order defended by a Justice Department rived by dissent against a growing list of opponents.
Mr. Trump seems to understand this.
The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 31, 2017
But what about Republican senators like John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Cory Gardner of Colorado?
They have leverage to demand changes before they seat Mr. Sessions at the Justice Department. But as the fight drags on, so does the lag in warrants. The pressure will only intensify.
At her confirmation hearings to be deputy attorney general, Ms. Yates faced a grilling from Republicans who were furious about former President Barack Obama's order liberalizing immigration policy.
The question: Would Ms. Yates be willing to stand up to the president?
Her inquisitor? Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and now Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general.
""If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say 'No?""' Mr. Sessions asked.
""I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,"" Ms. Yates replied.
Unreal exchange. Sessions asks Yates at Sen. hearing if DAG should say no unlawful order from POTUS. Yates: ""Obligation is to Constitution."" pic.twitter.com/5qWhdJhvxc -- Our Revolution (@OurRevolution) January 31, 2017
European Union official sees Trump as a threat
The European Union negotiator on Britain's exit from the European Union returned from the United States and declared that a united Europe now faces three threats: Islamist terrorism, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump.
""I have just come back from U.S., and my view is that we have a third front that is undermining the E.U., and that is Donald Trump,"" the negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, said in a speech at Chatham House, a think tank in London, according to a German newspaper.
""Trump spoke very favorably of the fact that also other countries will want to break away from the European Union, and that he hoped for a disintegration of the European Union,"" he added.
And speaking of Europe...
President Trump and his administration have enraged Mexico, bewildered Japan, incensed China and angered much of the Muslim world. So what's wrong with tweaking the Germans?
Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump's new National Trade Council, told The Financial Times that Germany was using a ""grossly undervalued"" euro to ""exploit"" the United States and its European Union partners.
That did not sit well with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel.
""Germany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did that before the euro existed,"" Ms. Merkel told a news conference with Stefan Lofven, the prime minister of Sweden, according to Reuters. ""Because of that we will not influence the behavior of the E.C.B. And as a result, I cannot and do not want to change the situation as it is,"" she added.

227,763640076.xml,"      BERLIN   THIS quiet, orderly man, who lives in a quiet, orderly house, in a very quiet tree-lined neighborhood has caused a huge public stir here with his volatile book arguing that Muslim immigrants in Germany are socially, culturally and intellectually inferior to most everyone else.   With the certainty of an accountant adding up rows of numbers, Thilo Sarrazin has delivered his conclusion in a book that has sold over one million copies, forced him to quit his job at the German central bank, may get him kicked out of his political party and for the first time since World War II made it socially acceptable in Germany to single out a particular minority for criticism.   ""The facts I quoted and analyzed are undeniable and cannot be done away with,"" he said without a hint of defensiveness in his quiet, understated manner.   Mr. Sarrazin, 65, is tall and trim, with a head of thick grayish hair, round tortoiseshell glasses and a right eye that is always squinting, as if looking into the sun. Friends of Mr. Sarrazin say they are not at all surprised that he has found himself in this position because while he is quiet and orderly, he also has a penchant for offending.   ""I am not impolite,"" he says.   He prefers blunt.   A few years ago, Mr. Sarrazin chastised the poor, saying they could easily survive -- even thrive -- on the approximately $5.50 a day they received for food from public assistance, and that they should stop complaining. He personally derailed a plan to privatize the German rail system, upsetting a political deal but winning praise for his fiscal acumen. He had to manage Berlin's finances when the city was about $75 billion in debt and is credited with significantly reining in city spending.   ""Bluntness,"" Mr. Sarrazin said, ""on the right subject at the right time is an element of success.""   MR. SARRAZIN'S latest blunt assessment came in the form of his book, ""Germany Does Away With Itself,"" which was released in August and provoked a heated national debate that has still not cooled. The government hosted a so-called integration conference last week, and a group of 650 citizens of Turkish origin issued a public letter saying, ""We all feel discredited through the current debate.""    Mr. Sarrazin seems to be enjoying it all.   ""As an author who had something to say and who wanted to influence the public debate, I could not be happier.""   What he does not enjoy is being shunned by the political elite, his longtime peers. He has put in writing what he says a lot of people here were thinking. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested -- indirectly -- that she agreed with one of Mr. Sarrazin's points, when she said that multiculturalism was dead.   Mrs. Merkel said integration into German society was necessary, echoing another of Mr. Sarrazin's claims.   Mr. Sarrazin greeted a visitor to his home one morning, during a rare lull in his schedule of book readings and television and radio appearances. His living room has lots of books on shelves, a few paintings and prints on the wall and a large flat-screen television. There are no personal touches, no family photographs, though he says his hobby is photography.    ""Some have said I argue that the achievements of immigrants from Muslim countries are lower because of genetic reasons; this is quite wrong,"" Mr. Sarrazin explained, as if to cast off any taint of prejudice. ""It has to be a matter of culture, and Islam is that culture.""   Mr. Sarrazin says his book can be boiled down to a few main ideas. To begin, ethnic Germans are having too few children, while Muslim immigrants are having too many. In a population of about 82 million, there are about four million Muslims (a number he said he calculated partly by looking at census figures for families with lots of children. Big families must be Muslim, he concluded). Within 80 years, he said, Muslims will make up a majority in Germany.    Second, Mr. Sarrazin believes that intelligence is inherited, not nurtured, and since Muslims are less intelligent (his conclusion) than ethnic Germans, the population will be dumbed down (his conclusion).    Third, to solve a growing demographic problem, Germany will require immigrants, but he says that bringing more Muslims into the country will only make matters worse. He says that after examining three indicators -- success in education and employment, and welfare dependency -- he concluded that Islam is by its nature a drag on individual success.   ""I came to a very astonishing conclusion, and this is important,"" Mr. Sarrazin said, his voice invoking a bit of drama. ""Immigrants from non-Islamic countries show no statistical difference to the German population at all. On the other hand, immigrants from Muslim countries pose much greater problems. Their language skills, academic skills and professional skills are much below average.""   WHAT he did not discuss, his critics say, was how it has been well documented in Germany that prejudice and discrimination have made it difficult -- nearly impossible -- for Muslims to get jobs, find housing or advance in education. A government official in Berlin said recently that many immigrants and their children were given an inferior education that did not prepare them for the work force. Mr. Sarrazin dismisses those factors as secondary, or irrelevant.    Still, it seems that what has made Mr. Sarrazin so popular, or notorious, is not just his attack on Muslims, which is certainly not the first. What he seems to have accomplished is blasting open a door many thought was sealed shut by Germany's Nazi past. As a lifelong Social Democrat, and not some fringe far right extremist, Mr. Sarrazin has made it acceptable for the German everyman to criticize a specific minority group, and to make sweeping statements about that group's intellectual capacity.

""The fact that he scapegoats a religion and associates failure and inferiority with a faith, has ruined the integration discourse in Germany,"" said Antje Scheidler, director of the Berlin office of the group Humanity in Action Deutschland.

3515,901286701.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED ATHENS -- The government of Prime Minister George Papandreou teetered on the verge of collapse on Tuesday, threatening Greece's adherence to the terms of a new deal with its foreign lenders and plunging Europe into a fresh bout of financial turmoil.   Several lawmakers in the governing Socialist Party rejected Mr. Papandreou's surprise plan for a popular referendum on the Greek bailout, raising the possibility that he will not survive a no-confidence vote scheduled for Friday that depends on his holding together a razor-thin parliamentary majority.    An emergency cabinet meeting convened by Mr. Papandreou ended at nearly 3 a.m. Wednesday, with the cabinet saying that it unanimously supported the prime minister's call for a referendum, local news outlets reported. The opposition and some members of his own party, however, were calling for new elections immediately.   The impasse in Athens seemed likely to delay -- and perhaps scuttle -- the debt deal that European leaders reached after marathon negotiations in Brussels last week. Financial markets cratered on Tuesday for the second straight day, wiping out the gains since the Brussels deal was announced last week. Some analysts said that Greece was now coming closer to a messy default on its debt, and perhaps a departure from the zone of 17 countries that use the euro as their common currency.   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, apparently caught off guard by Mr. Papandreou's call for a referendum and then by the disarray in his party, said they would hold emergency talks on Greece with euro zone leaders on Wednesday. They said they also planned to meet with representatives of the Greek government before a critical meeting of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies on Thursday, and they defended the terms of the bailout package as ""more necessary than ever today.""   The chairman of the euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned that the plan to hold a referendum endangered an $11 billion loan that Greece was to receive under the bailout deal, and that Greece urgently needed to avoid a default. Mr. Juncker, who is also the prime minister of Luxembourg, added that Greece could face bankruptcy if it votes ""no"" on the bailout.   The big fear is that a decisive turn against the bailout package in Greece could undermine European efforts to enforce deep budget cuts in other heavily indebted European countries, especially Italy, which is mired in its own political crisis and has a far larger economy and much more debt than Greece.    Political analysts and several advisers to Mr. Papandreou said the prime minister had decided to announce a popular referendum on Monday night as his last best hope to shore up his eroded political standing. They said he wanted to put Greece's fate back in the hands of the Greek people and to force his many opponents -- both inside his government and in the opposition -- to coalesce around the idea that what is at stake is Greece's membership in the euro.    He wanted Greek voters ""to take a position, to see the choice before us in its starkness, hoping they will back the lesser of two evils, instead of letting irate reactions in the streets dominate the debate,"" said one adviser to the prime minister.    But on Tuesday, it appeared that his move may have backfired. A lawmaker in his governing coalition left the Socialist Party to become an independent, another said she would not vote confidence in the government unless the prime minister formed a coalition government, and an additional six leading Socialists wrote a letter calling on Mr. Papandreou to resign and schedule early elections for a new government with greater political legitimacy. Together, the developments made it doubtful whether his government would survive a confidence vote, because the loss of even two supporters threatened his parliamentary majority.   Meanwhile, the center-right opposition New Democracy Party on Tuesday stepped up its calls for early elections. Its leader, Antonis Samaras, has opposed most of the austerity measures the government accepted in exchange for foreign financial aid. Mr. Samaras has said that if he were in power, he would try to renegotiate the terms of Greece's arrangement with its main foreign lenders, known as the troika: the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.   ""Mr. Papandreou, in his effort to save himself, has presented a divisive and extortionate dilemma,"" Mr. Samaras said on Tuesday. ""New Democracy is determined to avert, at all costs, such reckless adventurism.""   Mr. Samaras declined to say whether he would ask his 85 members of Parliament to resign, a move that would lead to the dissolution of Parliament and a snap election. The next general election was not due until 2013, when the Socialists' four-year term expires. Mr. Samaras is expected to clarify his stance at a meeting of his party's parliamentary group on Wednesday.   While the political instability took Europe and markets by surprise, it was less of a shock in Greece. Mr. Papandreou's political capital had run out and tension has been building for months -- not only with the center-right opposition, which objected to many of the terms of the austerity plan, but also within his own party.    That party, known as Pasok, is deeply divided. A more reform-minded wing is upset that Mr. Papandreou has not acted decisively enough to carry out the structural changes needed to revive the economy, while a more traditional wing is opposed to some of the changes that inevitably cut into the heart of the social welfare state the party was elected to promote.    On Tuesday, the two sides appeared to gravitate toward one idea: That the referendum proposed by Mr. Papandreou was a mistake.    ""His party just couldn't hold any more,"" said Ilias Nicolacopoulos, a professor of political science at the University of Athens and a pollster with close ties to the Socialist Party.    ""He did exactly the opposite of what a large number of his M.P.'s were asking for,"" he said. ""They were asking for a coalition government or cabinet reshuffle or some sort of cooperation that would bring broader consensus, not a referendum that would put the country in danger of blowing everything up.""    Eva Kaili, a Socialist member of Parliament, said she would not support the government in a confidence vote and called for a government of national unity. She said it was too late for a referendum, because it might destroy the arrangement already reached with Greece's foreign lenders.   ""It took us a long time to manage to reach an agreement,"" Ms. Kaili said in a telephone interview. ""The time is over. This should have happened one year ago, to ask people if they want the I.M.F. to help us or not.""   If Mr. Papandreou's government falls, it would not be the first one in Europe to be toppled by the austerity demanded by European debt relief. In Ireland and Portugal, governments fell after accepting bailouts from the European Union and the I.M.F., and last month the Slovakian government fell over a vote on whether to participate in the European Union's rescue package.   But Greece's problems are more acute, and its economic slump is much deeper, making the prospect of a government collapse even more worrying. While a new government might try to reopen negotiations with lenders and seek new terms, European leaders have repeatedly dismissed that idea, saying that trying to do so would be damaging and would throw away months of work on a plan to keep Greece from defaulting.   Many Greek voters say they are tired of hearing about decisions taken in foreign capitals and political initiatives that do not represent ordinary Greeks. ""The government is no longer in control -- others are calling the shots,"" said Akis Tsirogiannis, a 42-year-old father who recently lost his job at a furniture workshop in Athens.   He said he would vote against the debt deal in a referendum. ""This deal, like all the others, is a life sentence of austerity for Greeks,"" he said. ""We need to reclaim our country.""

3622,892522289.xml,"      In a sign of increasing pessimism over the prospects for a resolution to the Greek debt crisis, investors sold some of their riskier assets in the United States and Europe on Monday.    Financial markets were focused in part on a conference call between Greek officials and the so-called troika of foreign creditors -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- as well as further meetings among senior officials in Athens struggling to close a budget gap.   But the Greek finance ministry tried to deflate expectations of a speedy result. The conversation lasted around two hours on Monday evening before it was adjourned until Tuesday morning.   In Europe, market indexes fell about 3 percent, the euro declined and the price of safe assets like German bonds rose as investors continued to fret about the possibility of a Greek default. In the United States, stock indexes traded most of the day about 2 percent lower and bond prices rose.    Late Monday, Standard & Poor's announced it was cutting the credit rating of Italy's sovereign debt, to A from A+, with a negative outlook. S.& P. cut its forecast for Italy's economic growth, a slowdown that would make the country's fiscal targets difficult to hit, the agency said.    On Wall Street earlier Monday, stocks firmed slightly at the close, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down nearly 1 percent, or 11.92 points, to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.9 percent to 11,401.01, and the Nasdaq briefly reached into positive territory late in the day before closing 0.4 percent lower at 2,612.83.    Financial stocks were hard hit. Bank of America was down more than 3 percent at $6.99. Wells Fargo declined 2.5 percent to $24.33, and Citigroup fell 4.4 percent to $27.71. JPMorgan Chase was 2.8 percent lower at $32.49.   The 10-year Treasury bond rose 29/32 to 101 17/32, sending its yield down to 1.96 percent from 2.06 percent on Friday.    The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, and investors say they believe the Fed may announce new measures to promote economic growth.   Anthony Valeri, a fixed-income investment strategist for LPL Financial, said he believed that investors had already priced in the expected action, making Monday's movements in bonds ""exclusively risk aversion"" caused by the lack of progress in Europe.   Some analysts now fear that given the legal complications in some euro zone countries, and the apparent reluctance of Greece to push ahead on the kind of commitments on spending, wages and privatizations being sought by its partners, Greece might soon default, starting a domino effect on other countries like Portugal, Italy or Spain.   Those fears were compounded after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany lost ground in a regional election in Berlin on Sunday, amid voter anger over her handling of the debt crisis.   ""The background noise of the Greek debt crisis resembles a continuous alarm tone,"" Rainer Guntermann and Peggy Jager, analysts at Commerzbank, said in a research note. ""With few tangible results coming from the finance ministers' meeting over the weekend and still little official indication that the Greek debt swap may go through, speculation remains high and bonds remain in demand.""   The economic outlook was also downbeat after the secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, said Monday that global demand for oil was rising less than expected, Bloomberg News reported. Oil prices in New York fell more than 2.4 percent to $85.81.   ""We have risk aversion, profit taking and a stronger dollar on the back of the ongoing concerns both in Europe and domestically,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital.

288,433422555.xml,"      The German Foreign Ministry is preparing a new policy toward the east that aims to tighten ties between Russia and Europe, but does not address human rights, a theme dear to Chancellor Angela Merkel. According to Foreign Ministry officials, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has been informed of the policy and likes it. He will visit Germany on Tuesday for a meeting of the Petersburg Circle, a group established five years ago to promote economic, cultural, social and youth links between Russia and Germany. The policy is described in an internal paper prepared by the ministry. The subtext is clearly Europe's increasing dependence on Russia to meet its energy needs. But Mrs. Merkel won support from the German public last year by promising a more critical approach toward Russia, and her advisers say she prefers an approach to the east that takes into account the interests of Poland and the Baltic states, not just Western Europe's ties to Russia. ''The view of the chancellery is that we have to take care of Poland, Ukraine and the immediate neighborhood,'' said Jorg Himmelreich, a regional expert in the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. The Foreign Ministry paper advocates the adoption of this policy by the European Union during Germany's six-month presidency of the bloc, which begins Jan. 1. The gap in the approaches is, at least in part, a reflection of the power-sharing arrangement created after inconclusive elections last September. To create a governing coalition in Parliament, Mrs. Merkel crafted a deal between her Christian Democratic Party and the rival Social Democratic Party in which they split the posts in the 16-member cabinet and she became chancellor. The Foreign Ministry's paper, titled ''The German E.U. Presidency: Russia, European Neighborhood Policy and Central Asia,'' states that ''Russia will play a central role in the German E.U. presidency.'' In the ministry's vision, this policy would actively engage Russia and the post-Soviet states to bring them closer to Europe. The section on Russia highlights the energy ties with Europe that were strengthened by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, from 1998 to 2005. Mr. Schroder developed a friendship with Mr. Putin. On losing to Mrs. Merkel last year, Mr. Schroder was immediately appointed to head a German-Russian gas consortium dominated by Gazprom, Russia's state-owned monopoly. Some analysts say the Foreign Ministry's outlined policy is shortsighted, because it does not challenge energy relations. ''Germany is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia for its energy,'' said Prof. Claudia Kempfert, an energy expert at the German Institute for Economic Research. ''This dependence is dangerous, given how Putin is trying to push foreign investors out.''  Other experts note that it is uncertain that the policy described in the Foreign Ministry paper would lead to better relations. ''We don't have influence with Russia,'' said Roland Gotz, a Russian expert at the government-financed German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ''We cannot integrate Russia into NATO or the E.U., because Russia does not want to be integrated. We have no levers.''  Credit: International Herald Tribune  ",2006-10-08
3843,809982154.xml,"      PARIS -- Investors fled euro zone government bonds on Wednesday, putting further pressure on policy makers as they grappled with decisions over emergency financial bailouts and who should bear the costs.    Yields rose across the board, including on safer German, Austrian and French bonds. The yield on the 10-year benchmark Portuguese government bond hit 6.8 percent, as the country's biggest unions staged a one-day general strike to protest budget cuts.   Also causing agitation is the future of the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone's safety net of 440 billion euros (about $600 billion), which will need to be replaced after it expires in 2013.    In a speech to Parliament in Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany prodded her euro zone partners to agree by the end of this year on rules that would require private bondholders to pay some of the costs of future bailouts.   ""Have politicians got the courage to make those who earn money share in the risk as well? Or is dealing in government debt the only business in the world economy that involves no risk?"" Mrs. Merkel said, according to Reuters.   Leaks to German newspapers and news agencies suggest that Berlin is moving swiftly to complete proposals for a binding change in repayment terms in the event of default. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment.    There are ""various papers circulating"" and the subject is ""very fluid at this stage,"" said an official in Berlin, who was not permitted to speak publicly.    ""The tide is definitely turning in favor of Merkel's ideas,"" said Michael Derks, chief strategist at the brokerage FxPro in London. ""It may be harsh on Europe's bondholders but, equally, utterly necessary.""   The yield on Irish bonds reached 8.6 percent after the ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating to A from AA- and put it on negative watch. On Monday, its rival, Moody's Investors Service, said a review of Ireland's credit rating could result in a ""multi-notch downgrade"" as a result of the bailout of Dublin, currently being negotiated by international lenders.    David Schnautz, interest rate strategist at Commerzbank in London, said the fear of more European downgrades was ""adding fuel to the fire.""    The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents participants in the derivatives industry, declared Wednesday that members had accepted a restructuring of credit-default swaps on Anglo Irish Bank debt and would hold an auction of outstanding securities, themselves meant to reduce the risk in a default.    Holders of some subordinated Anglo Irish debt have already agreed to accept write-downs on their holdings, which Mr. Derks of FxPro said had set ""a precedent that is likely to represent the benchmark not just for Ireland's other suspect banks but across Europe as well.""   The euro was stable at $1.3377 from $1.3368 late Tuesday, and European shares closed higher.   Mr. Schnautz, at Commerzbank, said that Portugal would probably need to return to markets by late January in preparation for a large redemption of bonds, about 9.5 billion euros, in April and June.    If investors keep forcing its yields higher, Lisbon might opt for cheaper financing from the International Monetary Fund and from its European Union partners, as was the case for Ireland and Greece.   ""Portuguese yields are very high for a country flirting with a return to recession,"" Mr. Schnautz said. ""Will Portugal be proactive or will it hope for the best and try its luck in January?""   The political and social backdrop is adding to concerns. In the first joint strike in over 20 years, the major Portuguese unions aimed to weaken Lisbon's resolve in installing austerity measures. News reports said the unions brought trains, buses and planes to a halt and affected services. A final vote on a new 2011 budget is scheduled for Friday.      ",2010-11-25
3101,1014285240.xml,"      CAMP DAVID, Md. -- Leaders of the world's richest countries banded together on Saturday to press Germany to back more pro-growth policies to halt the deepening debt crisis in Europe, as President Obama for the first time gained widespread support for his argument that Europe, and the United States by extension, cannot afford Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-size-fits-all approach emphasizing austerity.   Pointedly recognizing ""that the right measures are not the same for each of us,"" the leaders of the Group of 8 nations, at a meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David, committed to ""take all necessary steps"" to strengthen their economies. They said they wanted to keep Greece in the euro zone and vowed to work to promote growth in Europe, though behind the scenes distinct differences remained over what kinds of stimulus policies to pursue.   ""Our imperative,"" the leaders said in their statement, ""is to promote growth and jobs.""   It is by no means the final word in the growth-versus-austerity fight that has been under way for two years. Even with the future of the European currency union in doubt, Germany has insisted that Europe's ailing economies tackle their financial problems through spending cuts, a policy that critics say has caused higher unemployment, brought Greece to the edge of bankruptcy and worsened the crises in Spain and Italy.    The leaders did concede somewhat to Ms. Merkel's position on austerity, acknowledging that national budget deficits had to be addressed. But they added that spending cuts must ""take into account countries' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economy recovery,"" a recognition of how much the austerity packages have dampened consumer and political confidence in Europe.   Also, in a warning to Iran, the leaders pledged to take steps to guarantee continued oil supplies after an oil embargo against Iran begins on July 1.While Greece is not part of the Group of 8 -- the club is made up of the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- the political and economic crisis facing Athens hovered over the meeting. Greece has been unable to form a government after voters, angry over austerity measures, brought down the last government, and there is now talk of bringing back the drachma and abandoning the euro.   Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama met privately after the meeting ended. In her public remarks, the German chancellor said that growth and deficit-cutting reinforced each other, and that ""we have to work on both paths, and the participants have made that clear, and I think that is great progress.""   With his own re-election bid tied to a fragile American economic recovery that could easily reverse if Europe's economy takes another turn for the worse, Mr. Obama was pushing hard on Saturday for a euro-zone growth package. American officials said they hoped that after the full-court press this weekend at Camp David, Ms. Merkel would be more amenable to the pro-growth argument when she meets with European leaders this week at a summit to come up with specific steps to fight rising debt while spurring the economy.   The last time world leaders met to discuss the European debt crisis, in Cannes last November, the French president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, joined with Ms. Merkel to push Italy to stick to an austerity package. But the tone was different this time. Mr. Sarkozy lost his re-election bid to Francois Hollande, who came into office last week promising to focus on growth. And even before they showed up at Camp David to gang up on Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama had forged a new alliance at a prearranged meeting at the White House to focus on growth.    In comments to reporters afterward, Mr. Obama said that the group needed to discuss ""a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda.""   ""If a company is forced to cut back in Paris or Madrid, that might mean less business for workers in Pittsburgh or Milwaukee,"" Mr. Obama said to explain why the European crisis matters to the United States. He said that while Europe's predicament is ""more complicated"" since it requires coordination among multiple governments, steps his own government took to blunt the impact of the American financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, including the stimulus, can stand as an example for Europe.    In a tense meeting here at this storied presidential retreat, it seemed at times as if it was Ms. Merkel -- who faces stiff opposition at home to more bailouts of its neighbors by German taxpayers -- against the world. Things did not seem to get off to a good start either on Friday night, as Mr. Obama greeted his guests for dinner in a rustic wood cabin.   ""How've you been?"" Mr. Obama asked Ms. Merkel.   She shrugged and pursed her lips.   ""Well, you have a few things on your mind,"" Mr. Obama said consolingly.   Mike Froman, Mr. Obama's top adviser on international economic affairs, was careful not to publicly single out Ms. Merkel and Germany when talking to reporters after the meeting. The debate over austerity vs. growth, he said, ""has been going on for some time, and we welcome the evolution on that debate.""    But it remains unclear how far Ms. Merkel will go, despite the pressure from other leaders. Ms. Merkel on Saturday was fresh from a war of words with Greece over that country's continued membership in the euro, with Greek politicians complaining that Ms. Merkel had suggested a referendum asking Greece whether it wanted to stay in the euro, a claim that a spokesman for Ms. Merkel has denied.   Separately, the leaders also said they ""stand ready"" to call on the International Energy Agency to take appropriate action to guarantee oil supplies if prices spike. ""There have been increasing disruptions in the supply of oil to the global market over the past several months, which pose a substantial risk to global economic growth,"" the group said in a statement.   The oil statement was meant to reassure oil markets that nations will consider tapping into their oil reserves if there is a supply shortage. It is particularly meant to send a warning to Iran -- which is the target of an oil embargo to begin July 1 as part of the western effort to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions -- that the West will work to counteract high oil prices once the sanctions go into effect. Finally, it is meant to reassure countries like India and China that they will not be hurt by higher prices once the sanctions begin.   Still, American officials expressed optimism that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, which are set to reopen at the end of the month in Baghdad, might be productive.   The intimate setting of the meeting -- in secluded Camp David, where the leaders slept in cabins and their attendants shared rooms -- allowed for a more relaxed atmosphere, White House officials said.    Mr. Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain were on treadmills early Saturday morning discussing ways to help ease the debt crisis.   ""Nobody felt defensive or put on the defense,"" Mr. Froman said, disputing reports that Ms. Merkel was isolated.   Credit: HELENE COOPER; Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington.

1368,1783652164.xml,"       If nothing else, the astounding presidential election of 2016 has shown that Americans are ready to junk the present system and try something bold, even reckless. Small ball is out. Incremental change is a nonstarter. Big will beat little. Almost two-thirds of voters -- Democratic and Republican majorities -- agreed with the statement that ""The old way of doing things no longer works and we need radical change,"" when asked in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. This is not a frustrated fringe. The largest cluster of voters willing to chuck the status quo, not surprisingly, supports Donald Trump. But he offers nothing for them, no details, no workable solutions, just a buffoon with a gold-plated selfie stick. Getting his clock cleaned by the loathsome Ted Cruz in caucus states where cajoling stray delegates matters is proof that in the one area where Trump is supposed to be so good -- deal making -- he is incompetent. The next highest concentration of voters seeking radical change is drawn to the shouted shibboleths of Senator Bernie Sanders, the 74-year-old socialist. Sanders is a sloganeer with authenticity. But a rant, no matter how dead-on, is not a governing blueprint. His answer, on a number of occasions, to complex issues has been ""I haven't thought about it a whole lot."" In many areas, he's almost substance-free. Still, Sanders has more than accomplished what he set out to do: expose the deep flaws of modern capitalism and how corporate control of our democracy has done little for average people. Voters, especially the young, aren't afraid to embrace some form of Euro-socialism. The Bern has been felt. That brings us to Hillary Clinton, with her fat résumé and machine-run inevitability. Contrary to what Sanders said in one of his arm-flailing snit-fits, no one in the United States is more qualified to be president than the former madam secretary. And yet, her trumpet is barely a bugle; she's the shrug candidate. Among the three leading contenders, Clinton is the one least likely to be viewed as ""leading a movement,"" that same Quinnipiac poll found. Her problems are more than cosmetic. She's not a natural politician, as she admits, though her game was sharp in New York. And Clinton fatigue is no passing hangover. That grifter edge, from 1970s cattle future questions to Clinton Foundation ethical issues, is never far away. But compared with the monumental flaws of Trump, Clinton is in great shape. You don't need the oratorical gifts of Barack Obama, the élan of John F. Kennedy or the kinetic spark of Teddy Roosevelt to be president. What you do need is a big idea, something much greater than the personality of the politician. As John Kasich admitted on Wednesday: ""If you don't have ideas, you got nothing, and frankly my Republican Party doesn't like ideas."" Hillary Clinton has ideas, but what is the overarching one? ""Fighting for us,"" her slogan, sounds like poll-driven pablum. You'd think that electing the First Woman President would be a big deal. But we've seen women lead other nations, from Margaret Thatcher in England to Angela Merkel in Germany. The novelty is meh. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has some of that historic shine, but then she's the Notorious R.B.G., the coolest octogenarian in a black robe. The level of support Clinton will get for her gender may be in direct proportion to how much Trump continues to attack women -- for their looks, for wanting control of their own bodies, for his disgusting hints at how hot his own daughter is. The big idea is out there, in the bundle of issues in the Democratic campaign and solutions to the economic malaise that troubles Trump supporters. They're all bits of a new tomorrow, many coming from the Sanders campaign. But the parts are not enough. Consider the epic changes over the past century that brought lasting good to this country. Social Security and Medicare, allowing millions of Americans to live in dignity, were part one. The Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of the 1960s, which completed what Abraham Lincoln started with the 13th Amendment, were part two. Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, which made the nation's cities breathable, waterways swimmable and the country more habitable for all living things, were part three. Clinton needs to fashion a part four, attacking inequality with an institutional uplift to the slipping middle class. Those earlier initiatives were radical changes, the kind of big ideas the public is clamoring for now. Here's the central conundrum for Clinton: A majority of people think the system is broken, and must change. But a majority also has an unfavorable view of Clinton (and can't stand Trump, by a higher margin, across the board). But one will take care of the other; she can break out of the prison of her personality with something grand and unifying and bigger than herself. Follow me on Twitter.

4139,1543394319.xml,"       BEIJING --  The visit to China by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was supposed to focus on business, but financial matters were overshadowed Monday by a spy scandal at home -- reportedly involving the United States -- and China's wartime history with Japan. At a news conference with Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Ms. Merkel raised questions about Germany's relationship with the United States when asked about allegations that an employee of her country's Federal Intelligence Service was working for Washington. ""If the allegations are true, it would be a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners,"" Ms. Merkel said. She added, ""If the reports are correct it would be a serious case."" The arrest of the intelligence employee has caused an uproar in Germany, along with demands for an explanation from the Obama administration. The episode follows revelations by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, that the N.S.A. had bugged Ms. Merkel's cellphone and monitored the electronic activities of millions of Germans. In Berlin on Monday, the United States Embassy broke its official silence on the spy report, saying, ""We are working with the German government to ensure this issue is resolved appropriately."" The short statement reiterated that Washington does not discuss details of alleged intelligence activity or pending law enforcement matters. The statement followed a demand by Heiko Maas, the justice minister, that ""the surveillance madness of the N.S.A. must now come to an end."" He said that legal action might be taken. Relations between Beijing and Washington have also been strained by Mr. Snowden's reports of American espionage, and Chinese officials seemed pleased to hear Ms. Merkel's dismay at the possibility of a German's spying for the United States. Mr. Li denied at the news conference that China had conducted its own cyberespionage. ""China and Germany, it can be said, are both victims of hacking attacks,"" he said. Ms. Merkel's appearances here on Monday came on the anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge firefight of July 7, 1937, which China considers the start of World War II. The day is used by Chinese leaders to berate Japan for its brutal wartime occupation. With tensions between Japan and China running high, President Xi Jinping delivered a tough speech at a war museum that competed for Chinese news media coverage with the visit by Ms. Merkel, who is considered China's best friend in Europe. ""History is history, and facts are facts. Nobody can change history and facts,"" Mr. Xi said. ""Anyone who wants to deny, distort or beautify the history of the invasion will definitely not find agreement from the people of China or the rest of the world."" A German official familiar with the planning of Ms. Merkel's trip said that the chancellor's advisers had been aware that the July 7 anniversary coincided with her visit. But given the pressures of her schedule, including the timing of World Cup matches, there was no other convenient date, said the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. On the economic side, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Li signed agreements that included investments by Volkswagen of 2 billion euros, about $2.7 billion, in two new vehicle plants in the cities of Tianjin and Qingdao. Volkswagen said it had sold 1.5 million vehicles in China -- its biggest market -- in the first five months of the year. The main goal of Ms. Merkel's three-day visit, which started on Sunday, was to shore up Germany's flourishing business relationship with China at a time when Chinese companies are beginning to compete with their German counterparts. Some German firms in China have been feeling the credit squeeze in the Chinese banking system, and there are concerns that the economic bonanza with China could subside. Besides the Volkswagen deal, Airbus announced that it would sell 123 helicopters in the next six years to three Chinese companies. An arms embargo prevents European companies from selling military equipment to China; German officials said the helicopters would be used primarily for emergency medical care. Also, the German airline Lufthansa said it had signed a code-sharing agreement with Air China that would make travel on the two airlines more attractive within China because of better connections. Lufthansa said the agreement gave it ""even better access to the second-largest aviation market after the U.S."" Despite the emphasis on wartime history and accusations of American spying during Ms. Merkel's visit, China has not entirely escaped questions on its own espionage activities. On Sunday, as Ms. Merkel visited a Volkswagen factory in Chengdu, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence service, Hans-Georg Maassen, warned in a newspaper article that midsize German companies doing business in China were often victims of industrial espionage. ""They often don't really know what their crown jewels are or what the other side is interested in,"" Mr. Maassen said. ""They are up against very powerful adversaries. The Chinese technical intelligence agency alone has over 100,000 employees."" Credit: JANE PERLEZ; Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin.

3228,1727827914.xml,"       FRANKFURT --  A remarkable period of growth ended at Volkswagen on Wednesday when the carmaker reported its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years and began the costly process of absorbing the expense of fixing millions of cars designed to cheat on emissions tests. The day also was the end of a defining era of Volkswagen ambition. Matthias Müller, the new chief executive, signaled that the company would no longer be focused on becoming the world's largest carmaker. He said on Wednesday that sales would not cease to be an overriding measure of success. In another shift, he also said that top executives at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, who had been criticized for micromanaging, would no longer get involved in details of product design. Mr. Müller's statement represents a clear break from his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in late September after the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States disclosed that Volkswagen diesel cars were equipped with software that could detect when a car was being tested and crank up pollution controls. After he became chief executive in 2007, Mr. Winterkorn declared his determination to make Volkswagen the world's largest carmaker, overtaking Toyota. He was known for his intense attention to the technical fine points of the vehicles the company produced. ""A lot of things were subordinated to the desire to be faster, higher, larger,"" Mr. Müller said in a conference call with analysts and reporters on Wednesday. He also said, ""I have no intention of intervening in the details of product design."" Mr. Winterkorn's management style, coupled with a relentless drive for growth, is cited by some critics of the company as a contributing factor to the scandal by impeding open communication and perhaps causing subordinates to cheat rather than admit failure. The earnings report on Wednesday provided a first taste of the financial cost to Volkswagen of its past behavior. The company said it had a net loss of $1.84 billion in the third quarter as it set aside a huge sum to help cover the expected damage from the company's emissions-cheating scandal. It was the first quarterly loss in as long as anyone could remember. A company spokesman said that internal records went back only to 2001. Previously, Volkswagen did not report quarterly earnings. The loss, totaling 1.67 billion euros, was in contrast to a profit of [euro]2.97 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Volkswagen subtracted [euro]6.7 billion from profit to cover the expense of recalling and repairing about nine million cars in Europe and the United States equipped with the illegal software. That sum does not cover the cost of fines Volkswagen is likely to have to pay to the E.P.A. and to other authorities around the world. Volkswagen also faces hundreds of lawsuits from customers who say the company sold them cars based on a false promise. ""It is still far too early to calculate the cost of legal measures,"" Frank Witter, the chief financial officer, said in the conference call on Wednesday. The company said it expected profit for full-year 2015 ""to be down significantly"" from 2014. Volkswagen shares rose on Wednesday, but the stock is down more than 20 percent since the emissions cheating became known on Sept. 18. During tests, the Volkswagen diesel engines with illegal software make full use of pollution controls and can pass emissions tests. But during regular operation, the engines emit many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide. Because the deception became known less than two weeks before the end of the most recent reporting period, the third-quarter results provide only a glimpse of the fallout. Volkswagen executives said on Wednesday that they had not seen any signs that the damage to the company's reputation from the scandal had kept buyers away from showrooms. But they added they were closely watching for possible negative effects in the months to come. Volkswagen said it had an operating loss of [euro]3.5 billion in the quarter, compared with an operating profit of [euro]3.2 billion a year earlier. The loss was partly offset by [euro]1.5 billion in profit the company received for selling its nearly 20 percent stake in the Japanese vehicle maker Suzuki in September. Sales in the quarter rose 5.3 percent to [euro]51.5 billion, Volkswagen said, largely because of gains by its Audi, Bentley and Porsche divisions and favorable currency movements. However, the number of vehicles sold slipped to 2.35 million in the quarter from 2.44 million a year earlier. The recent sales data showed that Volkswagen was vulnerable even before the scandal. Sales have been slumping in China, the company's largest market, and other important markets like Brazil, which is in a severe recession. Shortly after the conference call Wednesday, Mr. Müller joined Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on a trip to China. He was expected to brief her on Volkswagen's response to the scandal. Volkswagen this year briefly surpassed Toyota in the number of cars produced, but has since slipped back to No. 2. Mr. Müller said that while size was important -- it allowed car companies to spread costs of development over more vehicles -- Volkswagen would put more emphasis on factors like customer satisfaction and profitability. ""The point is not whether we sell 100,000 more or less than a major competitor,"" he said. Mr. Müller said that Volkswagen was conducting its own investigation of how the emissions cheating occurred, but provided no new details on the progress of the inquiry. ""We need to find out the truth and learn from it,"" he said. Volkswagen had advertised that its ""clean diesel"" motors were environmentally responsible while delivering excellent fuel economy and performance. But the deceptive software made that economy and performance possible only by allowing the engines to emit up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide, an air pollutant that can be harmful to lungs. The German government has ordered Volkswagen to recall 8.5 million vehicles in Europe with the software, and the company has said it will repair an additional 500,000 in the United States at no cost to customers. But it remains unclear how the company can make the cars compliant with air quality regulations without also hurting performance and fuel economy. Any fix that hurts the cars' resale value will provide ammunition to disgruntled customers and their lawyers. Mr. Müller has raised the possibility of job cuts because of the cost of the scandal and has said Volkswagen will cut spending on new projects. The company employs 614,000 people worldwide. Analysts say that Volkswagen, which said on Wednesday it had [euro]28 billion in cash on hand, can probably absorb the financial blow of the scandal. But spending on crucial new technologies like self-driving cars could suffer at a time when the industry faces potential new competition from Google and Apple. Both companies have been working on car-related projects. ""The financial burden from the diesel crisis is enormous but manageable,"" Mr. Witter, the chief financial officer, said.

3046,1860708382.xml,"       So Theresa May, the British prime minister who was not elected to her post, wants to create something called ""Global Britain."" (She thought about alternative branding -- ""Parochial Britain"" -- but was advised it was unsexy.) May wants to achieve this by taking Britain out of the European Union, out of a single market of a half-billion people and into a new ""embrace"" of the world -- excluding, of course, Spaniards, the French, Germans, Italians, Swedes and their ilk. The prime minister is so keen on the idea that she used the word ""global"" 17 times in her speech on Tuesday setting out her Brexit plans. Madam, thou doth protest too much. The Onion's headline was: ""May to European Union: Drop Dead. May to World: We Love You."" Actually, that was not in The Onion, but it should have been. I wonder if May, who studied geography at Oxford University, has ever taken a stroll round London, that inward-looking city where you never hear a foreign tongue. After 43 years in what is now called the European Union, the British capital has become insufferably insular. Its cuisine lacks variety. Its financial institutions have no international heft. Its skyline speaks of stunted ambition. Its culture is provincial, its theater hidebound and its worldview small-minded. No wonder May felt she had to take London global. And Britain as a whole! For 43 years the country has been a member of an introverted, stifling little entity called the European Union that has just concluded a free trade deal with Canada, has dozens of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, boasts the United States as its top trading partner, takes some 44 percent of British exports and accounts for 22 percent of world economic output. How could Britain possibly be global within this straitjacket? No, it had to get out of Europe to go global (and make sure its citizens could no longer work in Europe)! The June 23 referendum, May insisted, was ""the moment we chose to build a truly global Britain."" I know this is a political moment when black equals white, no means yes, two plus two equals five, and ""post-truth"" is the phrase du jour. Still, this was a Trump-size whopper from May. She had obviously been steeped in Orwell before her oration. The vote for Brexit was, in fact, the moment Britain turned its back on the world, succumbing to pettiness, anti-immigrant bigotry, lying politicians, self-delusion and vapid promises of restored glory. ""Global Britain"" is a specious branding effort designed to mask an expensive mistake, opposed by 48 percent of voters. Now, a memory stirs. May at the Conservative Party conference in October saying this: ""But if you believe you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere. You don't understand what the very word 'citizenship' means."" So much for May and her global baloney: She doesn't like people who move from country to country, who may feel allegiance to more than one, and who have concluded that the most useful form of citizenship these days is one dedicated not only to the well-being of a Berkshire parish, say, but to the planet. Global Britain without global citizens, please! There was at least one honest sentence in her speech: ""Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe."" That, you see, is what it was all about -- too many Poles and Romanians doing jobs nobody else wants. May rambled. She does not want the single market (because it entails free movement of E.U. citizens). But, oh, maybe she wants bits of it. Like for the export of cars or freedom to provide financial services across borders. May has already had to make promises to Nissan to stop the Japanese automaker from getting out of Sunderland. She's terrified that financial institutions will quit the City en masse. Her comeuppance awaits in the form of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who knows global baloney when she sees it. You don't have your cake and eat it in negotiations with Merkel. I write as Donald Trump has just become the 45th president of the United States. Nobody really has much idea of what will happen next. President Vladimir Putin says that Trump would never run after Russian ""girls of loose morals, although ours are undoubtedly the best in the world."" Good to know that at least. May seems to see Trump as her global ace in the hole, her counterweight to the European Union. She has been making nice to him. Her government has voiced extraordinary public criticism of Secretary of State John Kerry's speech on Israel-Palestine, and largely shunned a Middle East conference in Paris that the Trump team opposed. In her speech, May pointedly remarked that Britain was not ""at the back of the queue"" for a trade deal with the United States, as President Barack Obama had warned, but at the front in the hour of Trump. Global Britain! Make America Great Again! Russia for Russians! As Orwell is said to have observed, ""In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.""

143,1762277444.xml,"       BERLIN -- The German cabinet took significant steps on Wednesday toward toughening asylum rules in the wake of the Cologne assaults, approving among other measures a two-year ban on family reunifications and excluding three North African countries from its asylum list. The steps came just a week after the cabinet moved to make it easier to deport migrants who commit crimes, deepening a new and harsher line by the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has come under mounting criticism for her asylum policies. The measures approved Wednesday, which also included a plan to house asylum seekers in special facilities to speed their applications, must be submitted to Parliament, where they seem certain to pass. The steps were clearly intended to make Germany less welcoming for migrants, and to blunt opponents of Ms. Merkel's decision to throw open the doors to about a million asylum seekers last year. Other measures approved by the cabinet included demanding small contributions from asylum seekers -- 10 euros, about $11, from their monthly stipends -- to help cover the costs of integration courses. In addition, deportees who are sick and have previously claimed that they must stay in Germany for medical care will have to leave if health care in their home countries is deemed sufficient. The cabinet also designated Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as safe states, meaning those who have arrived from the three North African countries now face deportation. The push against allowing citizens of those countries to stay has gained momentum since the New Year's Eve assaults in Cologne by men largely described as Arab or North African in appearance. The police in Cologne and nearby Düsseldorf have also raided North African communities in the two cities in a crackdown on crime. Since the assaults, Ms. Merkel has promised a ""palpable reduction"" in the number of migrants arriving. But she has refused to bow to demands from her own conservative camp to set a cap in 2016. Instead, she has accelerated diplomacy in Europe and several measures at home aimed at curbing the influx. Germany continues -- with little success so far -- to ask European Union partners to help redistribute refugees across the 28 member states, and is pushing to secure a deal with Turkey that would curb the number of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Elections loom in three of Germany's 16 states in mid-March, lending extra urgency to the quest to reduce the refugee flow. Opinion polls uniformly predict that an anti-immigrant, right-wing party, the Alternative for Germany, will enter all three state Parliaments. Asked for figures on how many refugees would be affected by the two-year ban on family reunifications, which was first proposed in November, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière declined to specify, but noted that it would not apply to those seeking asylum because of targeted persecution. The government will also continue to issue entry permits to relatives, almost all Syrians, waiting in the overcrowded refugee camps of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Mr. de Maizière, who has just returned from a two-day trip to Afghanistan to try to reduce the flow of migrants from there, said he would travel soon to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to negotiate the return of those countries' citizens. The minister said more measures would be needed to reduce the influx of migrants, but cited the package approved Wednesday as evidence of the government's resolve to keep working toward its goals. The number of Algerians seeking asylum increased to almost 2,300 in December from 840 in June, and applicants from Morocco went to 2,896 from 368, according to the German authorities. The number of Afghan applicants last year hovered around 150,000, second only to the number of Syrians seeking asylum here. Mr. de Maizière said on Wednesday that Afghanistan -- where German soldiers are still deployed and German police are training Afghan forces -- could not be considered a safe country. But he insisted that there were ""safe areas"" there, and renewed his plea, also made on Afghan television during his visit, that Afghans stay home and not risk their lives and savings on a perilous trek to Germany, which may well send them back.

120,1888574565.xml,"ISTANBUL -- A slim majority of Turkish voters agreed on Sunday to grant sweeping powers to their president, in a watershed moment that the country's opposition fears may cement a system of authoritarian rule within one of the critical power brokers of the Middle East.With nearly 99 percent of votes in a referendum counted on Sunday night, supporters of the proposal had 51.3 percent of votes cast, and opponents had 48.7 percent, the country's electoral commission announced.
The result will take days to confirm, and the main opposition party said it would demand a recount of about 37 percent of ballot boxes, containing around 2.5 million votes.
But on Sunday night the result was already a political reality, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed his victory in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul. ""We are enacting the most important governmental reform of our history,"" he said.
The constitutional change will allow the winner of the 2019 presidential election to assume full control of the government, ending the current parliamentary political system.
The ramifications, however, are immediate. The ""yes"" vote in the referendum is a validation of the current leadership style of Mr. Erdogan, who has been acting as a de facto head of government since his election in 2014 despite having no constitutional right to wield such power. The office of Turkey's president was meant to be an impartial role without full executive authority.
The result tightens Mr. Erdogan's grip on the country, which is one of the leading external actors in the Syrian civil war, a major way station along the migration routes to Europe and a crucial Middle Eastern partner of the United States and Russia.
Many analysts were surprised by the close result, saying they had expected Mr. Erdogan to achieve a larger majority because he had held the referendum within an atmosphere of fear.
Since a failed coup last summer, Turkey has been under a state of emergency, a situation that allowed the government to fire or suspend about 130,000 people suspected of being connected to the failed putsch, and to arrest about 45,000.
The campaign itself was characterized by prolonged intimidation of opposition members, several of whom were shot at or beaten while on the stump by persons unknown.
The opposition questioned the legitimacy of the referendum after the election board made a last-minute decision to increase the burden needed to prove accusations of ballot-box stuffing. At least three instances of alleged voter fraud appeared to be captured on camera.
""We are receiving thousands of complaints on election fraud,"" said Erdal Aksunger, the deputy head of the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, known as the C.H.P. ""We are evaluating them one by one.""
The new system will, among other changes:
 Abolish the post of prime minister and transfer executive power to the president.
 Allow the newly empowered president to issue decrees and appoint many judges and officials responsible for scrutinizing his decisions.
 Limit the president to two five-year terms, but give the option of running for a third term if Parliament truncates the second one by calling for early elections.
 Allow the president to order disciplinary inquiries into any of Turkey's 3.5 million civil servants, according to an analysis by the head of the Turkish Bar Association.
Academics and members of the opposition are concerned that the new system will threaten the separation of powers on which liberal democracies have traditionally depended.
""It represents a remarkable aggrandizement of Erdogan's personal power and quite possibly a death blow to vital checks and balances in the country,"" said Professor Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington research group. ""Judicial independence was already shockingly weak before the referendum; the new system makes that worse.""
Mr. Erdogan's supporters deny that the new system will limit political and judicial oversight. If opposition parties win control of Parliament, they could override the president's decrees with their own legislation, while also asserting greater control over judicial appointments, supporters of the new Constitution contend.
The victorious ""yes"" camp also argues that a strong, centralized government will make Turkey better able to tackle its many challenges, including a troubled economy, the world's largest population of Syrian refugees, two terrorism campaigns, a civil war against Kurdish insurgents and the Syrian war across Turkey's southern border.
""A new page opens in our history of democracy with this vote,"" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, an Erdogan loyalist, said in a victory speech on Sunday night. ""Be sure, everyone, we will use this result as best as we can -- for the wealth and peace of our people.""
The fearful environment in which the referendum campaign was held has led watchdogs to question its fairness. In addition to the vast purges of perceived opposition members, the authorities also often prevented ""no"" campaigners from holding rallies and events. And Mr. Erdogan and his supporters often implied that their opponents were allied with terrorist groups or those suspected of plotting last year's failed coup.
Analyses of television coverage showed that the ""yes"" campaign received disproportionately more airtime than its opponents.
""It's been a completely unfair campaign,"" said Andrej Hunko, a German lawmaker assigned by the Council of Europe to observe the election.
Hundreds of election observers were also barred from monitoring the vote, and thousands of Kurds displaced by fighting in southeastern Turkey may not have been able to vote because they have no address, according to the Independent Election Monitoring Network, a Turkish watchdog.
Despite this, Mr. Erdogan's victory fell far short of the 20-point majority that he and his supporters had expected. ""This is a little bit bittersweet,"" said Cuneyt Deniz, an Erdogan supporter celebrating in Ankara. ""We were expecting above 60 percent.""
The result revealed a deeply divided country, nearly half of which now feels highly embittered. ""I am incredibly sad right now,"" said Yesim Kara, 37, a ""no"" voter in Istanbul. ""Dark days are ahead.""
Mr. Erdogan's victory ""will enhance the stability of the government, but it will weaken social stability,"" said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research group.
""The new social contract that is being built in Turkey is being based on a very weak foundation,"" he added.
Few could agree about how Mr. Erdogan would respond, and he offered no conclusive clues in his victory speech.
In one breath, he appeared to reach out to his opponents, calling the results the ""victory of everyone who said yes and no."" But in the next, he promised to reinstate the death penalty -- which would end any hopes that Turkey will join the European Union -- and mocked his opponents' intent to appeal the result.
""Don't beat the air,"" he said. ""It is too late now.""
Some believe Mr. Erdogan may initially try to rebuild relations with the West, which were severely damaged during the referendum campaign as he sought to manufacture diplomatic crises to energize his base at home.
After Germany and the Netherlands blocked Turkish officials from campaigning in those countries, Mr. Erdogan said both nations had shown Nazi-like behavior, drawing a rebuke from leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
Mr. Unluhisarcikli said he expected a victorious Mr. Erdogan to lead ""a charm offensive toward Europe and the U.S. to gain validation of the new system -- and such a charm offensive might include correcting some of the democratic backsliding that we've seen in Turkey.""
""On the other hand, if his charm offensive is not reciprocated,"" Mr. Unluhisarcikli added, ""then he might start initiating a Plan B, which involves tightening his grip on Turkish society.""
But Professor Eissenstat said it was unlikely Mr. Erdogan would spend any time repairing relationships with the opposition.
""Some people have imagined that Erdogan might reboot after a 'yes' victory and reach out to the opposition,"" he said. ""I don't think that is likely. The purges will continue; Erdogan's instinct is to crush opposition, not co-opt it.
""The question is whether further centralization of power and increased repression can bring stability and allow Erdogan to reboot a troubled economy,"" added Professor Eissenstat, a lecturer at St. Lawrence University. ""The record of the past 10 years is that the opposite is true.""
Mr. Yildirim, the prime minister, suggested in his speech that the government was unlikely to step back from its various vendettas at home and abroad. ""Our struggle with internal and external enemies will be intensified,"" he said.

720,433479010.xml,"      Yielding grudgingly to the growing European campaign against smoking in public places, Germany announced Friday that it would seek to ban smoking in restaurants, discos, schools and other public buildings, but not in pubs, bars or beer tents. The compromise, worked out by the coalition government, would bring this country, Europe's biggest tobacco market, closer to its neighbors in curtailing public smoking. But it would fall short of the recent laws passed by Britain, France, Ireland and Italy, which stamp out cigarettes in pubs and bars as well as other public places. Antismoking groups said the proposal was a milestone, given Germany's long resistance to any restrictions. They called on the Parliament to broaden the ban when it votes on it, probably next year. ''Germany has been lagging on this issue for 20 years,'' said Friedrich J. Wiebel, president of the German Medical Action Group on Smoking and Health, an antismoking organization. ''There is no reason why one group of customers should be protected and others should not.'' German officials defended the loopholes, saying the ban had a better chance of passing that way. For a people fixated on the virtues of fresh air, Germans are curiously tolerant of smoking in public places. Restaurants here are typically hazy with smoke. Customers who ask for a nonsmoking table are sometimes treated brusquely. Roughly a third of Germans smoke regularly, a proportion comparable to other major Western European countries. But Germany has more young smokers than many of its neighbors. And while the percentage of men who smoke has declined modestly since 1984, smoking has become more popular among women. One woman who quit years ago is Chancellor Angela Merkel. That makes her one of the few nonsmoking German leaders. Gerhard Schroder puffs on cigars, Willy Brandt smoked a pipe and Helmut Schmidt has frequently appeared on television talk shows wreathed in cigarette smoke. Mrs. Merkel's support for a smoking ban, though carefully modulated, helped turn the tide, according to antismoking groups. Surveys show that, despite their tolerance of secondhand smoke, a majority of Germans now favor banning it in restaurants. The hurdle, Dr. Wiebel said, is the German tobacco industry, which has historically had close ties to the government and has stymied previous efforts to curtail smoking.  ",2006-12-03
4256,2407201780.xml,"Adopting the proposal would make history for the bloc, vesting authority in Brussels in ways that more closely resembled a central government.BRUSSELS -- For decades, even when the 2008 financial crisis threatened to blow the bloc apart, the European Union's wealthier nations resisted the notion of collective debt. But the coronavirus has so fundamentally damaged the bloc's economy that it is now forcing European leaders to consider the sort of unified and sweeping response once thought unworkable.The European Commission, the bloc's executive branch, on Wednesday proposed that it raise 750 billion euros, or $826 billion, on behalf of all members to finance their recovery from the economic collapse brought on by the virus, the worst crisis in the history of the European Union.The plan, which still requires approval from the 27 national leaders and their parliaments, would be the first time that the bloc raised large amounts of common debt in capital markets, taking the E.U. one step closer to a shared budget, potentially paid for through common taxes.For those reasons, the proposal had all the hallmarks of a historic moment for the E.U., vesting greater authority in Brussels in ways that more closely than ever resembled a central government.""This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any one of us,"" Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, told European Parliament members in a speech in Brussels. ""This is Europe's moment.""At another moment -- one without a calamitous recession looming -- the proposal would probably have been dead on arrival and antagonized the populists and nationalists who oppose the gathering power of Brussels. But the urgent need for a powerful response to the virus has muted much of the appeal of that message, at least for now.There is little question that Europe's recovery will be difficult and cost trillions, with some of its economies set to shrink by as much as 10 percent this year. The friction between China and the United States also poses a major challenge for a bloc that trades heavily with both.Until now, the European Central Bank had been propping up the economy by sweeping up bonds by member states at low cost to ensure money keeps flowing in to finance stimulus efforts. But the economic crisis is so large that anything less than a bold response from European Union leaders risked inviting another kind of crisis -- one of legitimacy.With Britain gone, the calamity brought on by the virus forced Germany and France, the bloc's two strongest countries that often find themselves at loggerheads, to step up in a rare display of joint leadership, paving the way for the commission's proposal.Even so, the plan is bound to be watered down in the weeks and months ahead. The proposal requires unanimous backing by member states, and a handful of the richer and less affected ones, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, consider joint borrowing and grant distribution to be unfair.""We need to take everyone's interests into account and there are very different interest groups: the southern countries, who fundamentally always want more; the East Europeans, who have an interest in preventing everything from flowing south; and, of course, those who have to pay for it all, the net payers,"" Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor who opposes parts of the commission's proposal, told Politico Wednesday.But the countries hardest hit by the virus, namely Italy and Spain, are also too big and too central to the European Union's ambitions to let fail. For now the plan not only suggested large-scale joint borrowing, but also that most of the money raised be distributed in the form of grants, or free cash.The €750 billion raised would be split in two pots, the commission said. One would include €500 billion to be distributed as grants to all countries based on their recovery needs, with Italy getting the biggest slice and Spain the second biggest. This means the money would be free, with no repayment demanded and no strings attached, and would not count toward national debt levels.Another pot of €250 billion would be made available in the form of loans to countries that apply for them, coming with more scrutiny and conditions, and would be added to a country's debt load.At the heart of the commission's plan is the idea of using some of its own budget to issue bonds, a move it's made only a handful of times for smaller amounts in the past. The institution, which has a Triple-A rating, the best possible, from ratings agencies, said it could levy its own taxes to repay those bonds, which will have a maximum 30-year maturity.The European Commission itself will be greatly empowered if its proposal goes through, not only because it will be able to issue bonds in the markets, but also because any powers to raise taxes directly will give it more of the semblance of a federal government, which it currently lacks, as it depends almost entirely on member state contributions for its budget.If members don't grant the commission powers to raise its own taxes directly to repay the bonds, officials said they would need to pay bigger contributions into its budget, or see some of the programs it funds shrink or die to free up funds instead.Some see this move as a great step forward in deepening the economic binds that tie European Union members and bringing them closer to a United States of Europe. But experts warned that, while important, this is not a leap into mutualized debt, like in the United States.""We don't become a federal Europe, however the proposal is a big deal in terms of the architecture of the European Union,"" said Maria Demertzis of the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. ""If Europe is considering to issue common debt and to raise taxes to back this debt up, then we're talking about a big deal.""But real debt mutualization would see Germany guaranteeing Italy's debt, for example, said Mujtaba Rahman, who heads the Europe practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.""Von der Leyen's announcement today is a very important step, but only one on what will prove a long and windy road toward genuine debt mutualization in the European Union,"" Mr. Rahman said.""Berlin would demand a veto over Italian budgetary choices as the quid pro quo, and the European Union is nowhere near mature enough politically for such a system just yet,"" he added.The proposal pushed forward Wednesday sidesteps some of those stickier issues by making the European Commission the guarantor of any debt, rather than individual nations, something resisted in Germany and elsewhere and legally unacceptable under the current setup of the bloc.But both Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France recognized that allowing some E.U. countries to recover faster and stronger would only deepen inequalities in the bloc, hampering the way it trades and operates internally.Ms. von der Leyen, too, stressed that it's crucial for the recovery to be even across the bloc.Most of the onus on financing the recovery is still falling on national governments, and will continue to, even if the commission proposal is endorsed. Germany and other wealthy countries have their own ample funds to draw from to quickly prop up their economies and don't need European Union funding.Germany has deployed more than a trillion euros to support its economy, even cutting checks to out-of-work freelancers and bailing out and renationalizing a share of its national flag carrier, Lufthansa.But other nations, in particular those with fewer resources or still hobbling from the last crisis, need European Union funding more as they face depleted coffers and expensive borrowing in markets.The European Commission also made €540 billion available earlier in the crisis for members to finance unemployment benefits, small businesses and the rebuilding of their health care systems.A new president, on the job for less than a year and confronted with the worst recession in the European Union's history, Ms. von der Leyen has been under considerable pressure to propose an ambitious plan to support the bloc's recovery.The rare Franco-German proposal, floated last week, gave Ms. von der Leyen the top backing she needed, but a Dutch diplomat swiftly noted Wednesday that her plan would still meet resistance in the continent's wealthy north, paving the road for fraught negotiations among leaders starting next month.Charles Michel, the president of the European Council who presides over the 27 leaders' meetings, said there should be a session on June 19 to tackle the proposal, urging the heads of government to support Ms. von der Leyen's pitch and quickly deploy this money where it's needed.That sense of urgency may not be shared by all and the potential for a lengthy and messy approval process is a key problem with the Commission's proposals, experts said.""Its single biggest weakness is the fact that real money will only begin to flow where it's needed most next year, raising a question about the economic picture in the second half of this year,"" Mr. Rahman said.Ursula von der Leyen, leader of the European Commission, in Brussels on Wednesday (PHOTOGRAPH BY KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/A.F.P. -- GETTY IMAGES) (A1); The European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday.

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain on Thursday placed the blame for mob violence at the U.S. Capitol squarely on President Donald Trump.
Merkel and other leaders of the United States’ strongest allies in Europe expressed faith in the strength of American democracy, although Johnson said that the riot had undermined the image of the United States.
“These pictures made me angry and sad,” Merkel said, speaking before an online gathering of her conservative party’s Bavarian partners, the Christian Social Union, minutes after the U.S. Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.
“I deeply regret that since November, President Trump has not accepted that he lost, and did not do so again yesterday,” the chancellor said. “He stoked uncertainties about the election outcome, and that created an atmosphere that made the events of last night possible.”
Speaking at a news conference in London, Johnson condemned Trump for encouraging mob violence.
“Insofar as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol, and insofar as the president consistently has cast doubt on the outcome of a free and fair election, I believe that that was completely wrong,” Johnson said at a news conference in London.
He said he wanted to “unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way that they did in the Capitol.”
Johnson, who until recently cultivated close ties to Trump, suggested that the values America represented for the rest of the world had been endangered.
“All my life America has stood for some very important things, an idea of freedom and an idea of democracy,” Johnson said.
French President Emmanuel Macron, in a formal address, focused on the long-standing historical ties between his country and the United States.
“What happened today in Washington, D.C., is not America,” he said. He continued, “We believe in the strength of our democracies. We believe in the strength of American democracy.”
Yet images of armed rioters carrying blue pro-Trump flags storming and vandalizing the halls of Congress shocked, saddened and angered many in Europe, where an older generation still speaks with reverence over the American role in securing peace after the bloodshed of two World Wars.
For others, especially younger Europeans, the pictures of armed rioters dressed in camouflage or outlandish superhero outfits reinforced the stereotype of Americans as gun-toting cowboys with little regard for the rule of law, a view that has been solidified in the minds of many over the four years of the Trump presidency.
Merkel grew up in communist East Germany and has spoken frequently about her admiration for the United States, even in the face of tensions between Berlin and Washington during her more than 15 years in power. Her comments Thursday reflected a deep-seated faith in the strength of democracy in the United States held by many in Europe.
Merkel, who weighs her words carefully and has made clear that she feels it is not her place to meddle in other countries’ internal politics, was unusually blunt in her comments about Trump’s role in the mayhem.

It was not, however, the first time she had spoken candidly about what she views as his disregard for the basic principles of democracy, and the processes and institutions that underpin their existence and allow them to thrive.
In 2016, Merkel’s congratulatory remarks about Trump’s election offered cooperation on the basis of the shared principles of “freedom, the respect for the law and dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political beliefs.”

On Thursday, she reminded him how a democratic election is supposed to work.
“A basic rule of democracy is that after elections there are winners and losers. Both must play their role with civility and a sense of responsibility so that democracy remains the winner,” said the German chancellor, who was escorted onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by Biden in 2009 to address a joint session of Congress.
“It is tragic that people lost their lives in the events, but for me it is a sign of hope that Congress continued its work overnight and now it is clear that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been confirmed and the United States will begin a new chapter in two weeks, as it should be,” Merkel said Thursday.
Despite their opposing personalities and leadership styles, the chancellor managed to maintain cordial relations with Trump throughout his term. German lawmakers and members of the chancellor’s Cabinet also maintained ties to their Washington counterparts who continued to value international cooperation.
Recalling France’s support for the colonists during the American Revolution and U.S. support for France during two World Wars, Macron also struck a note of hope.
France, he said, stood “strongly, fervently and resolutely with the American people and with all people who want to choose their leaders, determine their own destinies and their own lives through free and democratic elections.”
Even Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, one of Trump’s closest allies in Europe, expressed faith in the idea that U.S. democracy would triumph over forces trying to sabotage it.
“Violence is incompatible with the exercise of democratic rights and freedoms,” he wrote on Twitter. “I am confident in the strength and robustness of the institutions of the United States.”
Likewise, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, saw a reason for hope.
“Yesterday’s attack on Capitol Hill has only succeeded in reaffirming the principles we share,” he wrote on Twitter. “Spain will work with the United States for a more just world and the triumph of democracy over extremism.”

",2021-01-07
1930,862179473.xml,"      Berlin    I've always had a soft spot for Nicolas Sarkozy. He was the guy with the wrong name and the wrong background who took on the smug talkers with names like Dominique de Villepin and vanquished them. He was the outsider from the wrong schools who believed in energy and talent and had the audacity to smash the taboo that said a French politician can't love America and prosper.   Sarkozy was a doer. He thought Francois Mitterrand's seductive phrase (in French at least) -- ""Il faut laisser le temps au temps"" (You must let time take its course) -- was baloney that left you with disasters like the Bosnian genocide. He thought work and reward should be linked, a Gallic heresy, and he worked hard.   He hated the dependency culture of an overdeveloped French state, which entrenched rights and enfeebled responsibility. That he was elected president showed that France, deep in its soul, knew it had to escape the Mitterrand-Chirac rut with its glut of erudition and its glob of inaction. That was heartening.   The sanctimonious attacks on him from the left oozed the paralyzing conservatism that had blinded France to change. The attacks on Sarkozy from a blue-blooded or petit-bourgeois right often betrayed the same quasiracist disdain evident in rightist attacks on President Obama.   Yes, I liked Sarkozy -- and still do. Then there was his rudeness; his taste for his rich friends' yachts; his need for adulation that helped reduce a good newspaper, Le Figaro, to a fawning mouthpiece; his authoritarian itch from which gypsies most conspicuously suffered; his petulant impatience, his petty vanities and his peevish jealousies -- what Nicole Bacharan, a social scientist, calls ""the one-man soap opera.""   These were more than peccadilloes. But sharp elbows were needed to shift France from sleepwalk mode.   Only in recent weeks has the distance traveled come into focus: France, reintegrated in 2009 into the command structure of NATO, spearheading the United Nations-backed NATO military operation in Libya; providing armed muscle to the U.N. forces in Ivory Coast; and giving its pacifist-trending ally Germany a lesson in 21st-century Atlanticism.   Adenauer and de Gaulle must be turning in their graves. Here was Germany standing wobbly with Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and against its closest allies, France and the United States -- in the U.N. vote on Libyan military action. And here was France providing America's most vigorous NATO support.   This was a dramatic inversion of postwar roles. It revealed the drift of a navel-gazing Germany unprepared to lead despite its power and impatient with Adenauer's Western anchoring. It also demonstrated France's break under Sarkozy from the posturing Gaullist notion of a French ""counterweight"" to America. These are seismic European shifts.   In Benghazi, the capital of free Libya, when they see a NATO aircraft they say, ""There goes another Sarkozy."" After the French shame of Rwanda, a genocide where Mitterrand let time do its fullest work, that's something.   Perhaps it's only now with Sarkozy that another, deeper French shame is passing, one Mitterrand and Chirac knew: the ""strange defeat"" of 1940 with its paralyzing subsequent obfuscations.   Certainly, a presidential election next year has not been unrelated to Sarkozy's activism. Nor has a compensatory urge after France took the wrong side in Tunisia. But the president's instinct to save Benghazi and to oust Ivory Coast's usurper was right.   Sarkozy has intuited three things. First, the democratization of the Arab world is the most important European strategic challenge of the decade. Second, it was time ""to take the training wheels off,"" in the words of Constanze Stelzenmuller of the German Marshall Fund, and have Europe rather than an overextended America lead in Libya. Third, the U.N. cannot always be an umbrella that folds when it rains. If its ""responsibility to protect"" means anything, it must be when an Arab tyrant promises to slaughter his people.   We stand at a high point in French postwar diplomacy and a nadir in German. There were strong arguments on either side of a Libyan intervention, but with a massacre looming in Benghazi, Germany had to stand with its allies. Angela Merkel has proved herself more a maneuverer than a leader. Germany often conveys the sense that it now resents the agents of its postwar rehabilitation -- the European Union and NATO.   I don't think Germany believes its future lies with the BRIC countries, as the U.N. Libya vote suggested. I do think Germany has entered a new era of ambivalence and nationalist calculation.   That means several things. European integration is on hold, and as long it's on hold the future of the euro is at risk. The German-French alliance will remain under strain. Obama should look to Sarkozy, not Merkel, for strategic support.    A last thought. This restless French leader is at his best with his back to the wall. He's shown that. The same quality means it would be foolish to count him out next year.       ROGER COHEN           Thomas L. Friedman and the public editor are off today.          ",2011-04-17
2840,1236767610.xml,"       Silvio Berlusconi's announcement last week that he plans to run for a fourth term as prime minister is lamentable news for Italian politics and its economic reforms. Though it may sound like a bad joke given his failures to reform or revive the economy and his sex scandals, Mr. Berlusconi's return could do a lot of serious damage.  It has been a year since he resigned as prime minister amid plunging approval ratings and a rejection of his budget manipulations by European credit markets. To fill out the remaining year-and-a-half of his term, Parliament installed Mario Monti to run a technocratic government.  Markets promptly recovered. European Union leaders, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, applauded. But, in Italy, Mr. Monti took the political heat for the austerity measures that Ms. Merkel and her allies have continued to demand, and the recession that has been made worse by those measures. Still, Mr. Monti's achievements have been considerable, given the narrow space Italy's political parties and the euro zone's leaders left him to operate in. He managed to restore the Italian government's authority at home and win renewed respect in European councils.  But that's not enough. Mr. Monti has repeatedly told Ms. Merkel that Italy needs budgetary flexibility to fight recession. It must have more scope for stimulus spending and for infrastructure and education investments. His labor market reforms have also fallen short, mainly because he has had to appease constituencies in Mr. Berlusconi's center-right party and the center-left Democratic Party that demand continued job protection.  When Mr. Berlusconi withdrew his party's support last week, Mr. Monti responded by announcing he would resign and call for new elections as soon as next year's budget is approved. Those elections are expected in February. Because no major party is likely to be able to form a government on its own, each would have to assemble a majority with support from the host of small leftist, rightist, centrist and separatist parties.  Although Mr. Berlusconi's party is running at only 18 percent in the polls, that is enough to give him considerable influence. He now positions himself as a pro-European but anti-austerity candidate, but other European leaders have learned not to take him or his ever-changing positions seriously. Yet if he attracts enough votes to make his party the largest center-right bloc in the next Parliament, he would be well placed to deny any government a majority, except on his destructive, self-serving terms.  Mr. Monti could make that much harder by running as a reform candidate and rallying other centrists to his cause. Italy cannot afford more years of political stalemate and economic stagnation brought about by Mr. Berlusconi's shameless opportunism.   ",2012-12-12
2274,433920862.xml,"      Social Security is known as the ""third rail"" of American politics, and fiddling with retirement benefits can prove politically fatal in Europe too. Yet, in recent months and years some Europeans have  tried to defuse the time bomb posed by millions of  retirees receiving government benefits.    Italy  gradually raised the retirement age to 59. France  increased the tenure requirement for government workers to receive full pension benefits  to 40 years of service. Germany  curtailed annual government pension increases and raised the retirement age by two years, to 67.   But inflation and a squeeze on living standards for older workers are causing a backlash, leading some governments to reconsider -- or even suspend  -- approved reforms.    The fears of European workers are not unwarranted. Forty percent of Belgians over 75, for instance, will live in poverty by 2016, according to the National Pensions Office in Brussels, in part because of lower pensions.    Such statistics are one reason that even maintaining recently enacted reforms is proving difficult. Another is Helmut Polzer.    In a fit of rage last August, Mr. Polzer, a retired real estate developer near Munich, wrote his first letter to the editor in 50 years of reading his local newspaper, complaining about German politicians turning pensioners into ""paupers."" Almost as an afterthought, he suggested a solution.   ""I would be happy if the millions of pensioners -- our numbers are growing -- and all citizens disadvantaged by politics finally found their way into their own political party,"" Mr. Polzer wrote to  the newspaper, Munchner Merkur.   Weeks later, Mr. Polzer, 70, was presiding over a meeting to create the Pensioner Party, which plans to field candidates in regional elections this fall  on a platform of seeking a more generous pension system.   While still a nascent operation, the Pensioner Party's message resonates broadly with voters in Germany and  across Europe. With a higher birthrate and greater immigration, the United States faces a less acute problem with government pension benefits, despite periodic flare-ups over Social Security and fears about the long-term fiscal stability of the pension systems for many state and local government workers.   Most of the costs of an aging American society have to do with skyrocketing health care costs -- far less of a problem in Europe. The widespread use of private pensions and employer-based savings plans in the United States also eases the pressure on taxpayers to pay retirement costs.   But in much of Europe, the need for change is more pressing.   State pension costs as a percentage of gross domestic product are edging steadily upward. In France, for example, they will reach 14.8 percent in 2050, from 13.3 percent today, according to the European Commission. That would put French pension costs on the high end of the European average. It would also be more than three times the portion of the United States economy devoted to federal retirement programs.   A measure introduced in 2003 by Francois Fillon, then the French employment minister, now prime minister, required public sector workers to serve 40 years before getting a full pension. But the rule was riddled with exemptions for train operators, electricity and natural gas workers, and other groups.   Most of those loopholes were closed last fall after those affected were promised higher pay to end a nine-day strike. Now Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, wants to extend the required working time to 41 years by 2012 for the entire French work force, though without raising the formal retirement age from 60, as employers have demanded.    Opinion polls show that a majority of French people back the 41-year rule, but are opposed to increasing the retirement age.   Germany has gone further than France, probably because it is under more intense demographic pressure.   More than 15 percent of the German population  is now older than 65 -- about twice the proportion in France. In addition, during a long phase of high unemployment, German politicians were under pressure to reduce employer pension contributions in order to lower the cost of creating jobs.   In 2004, Gerhard Schroder, then the chancellor, threatened to resign if parliament did not pass his pension package reducing annual increases with a formula that took into account demographic changes and tax incentives for private pension savings.   Last year, it was the current government of Angela Merkel who raised Germany's official retirement age to 67 from 65. But with national elections coming up next year, the German parliament suspended the Schroder formula for one year. That had the effect of doubling the 2008 increase in pension payments to 1.1 percent -- hardly a windfall but clear evidence of the constant pressure politicians are under, even after new laws are passed.    ""They did a very good job of putting the system on a sensible financial track,"" said Monika Queisser, a pension expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ""The problem now is the social sustainability of what Germany has adopted.""    One factor that may  offset the issue could be the surprising success some countries have had with the introduction of private pensions.    Sweden created a system in 1999 that siphoned off 2.5 percent of a worker's gross income and invested it in privately managed stock and bond funds. Employees choose the funds themselves, based on their appetite for risk.    Since then, countries including Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and all the Baltic states, as well as Germany, have adopted similar programs. (A proposal by President Bush to do much the same died at the beginning of his  second term.)    Germany's system, using tax incentives to persuade people to save for their own retirement, got off to a slow start in 2001. But now some 11 million Germans have bought into it.   Mr. Polzer, the founder of Germany's pensioners' party, is even campaigning in favor of extending it. Thomas Langer, a professor of business at the University of Munster who studies pensions, said, ""I have no doubt that in the last five years there has been a serious change in mentality in Europe.""  He added,  ""it would have been nice if we had tackled it earlier though.""   The question is whether broader changes can be put in place -- and made to stick -- before the demographic time bomb explodes.    Vincenzo Galasso is a professor at Bocconi University in Milan and co-author of ""Contro i Giovani"" (Against the Young), a popular book with a cover illustration that shows  a Cronos-like monster devouring young people.    Italians are not eating their young, but they are, in Mr. Galasso's view, fleecing them. After agreeing to raise the retirement age to 60 by 2009, Italy put off the reform until 2017.   The median age of Italian voters is around 46 years now, but will reach the late 50s by midcentury, Mr. Galasso points out. Unless the retirement age rises further -- and soon -- more Italians will have a vested interested in opposing change.   ""We're on a continuum where reform becomes harder and harder,"" Mr. Galasso said. ""I hope that there is no point of no return.""

2470,877801260.xml,"      DITZINGEN, GERMANY -- Germany has long sat at the center of the European economy, but Europe is no longer as central to Germany as it used to be.   With large parts of Europe still in an economic rut and struggling to cope with a debt crisis, Germany is increasingly deploying its money and energy outside the euro zone to fuel its robust growth.   The shift in focus, while still in its early stages, could have profound economic and political implications because it comes at a critical time when the rest of Europe is counting on Germany to continue its traditional role as the locomotive of the Continent's economy.   German companies, instead of concentrating their investment overwhelmingly on countries like France and Italy, are sending a growing proportion of their euros to places like Poland, Russia, Brazil and especially China, which is already the largest market for Volkswagen and could soon be for Mercedes and BMW.   The German government is following suit, committing more diplomatic resources to its growing trade partners, particularly China, whose prime minister, Wen Jiabao, brought an entourage of 13 ministers and 300 managers when he visited Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany last month.   President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia brought a similar entourage with him Monday to Hanover for annual German-Russian consultations, including Alexander Medvedev, deputy chief executive of Gazprom.   The economic shift is already having important consequences inside Europe. As Germany becomes less dependent on euro zone markets, there are signs that it is becoming stricter with its ailing partners, like Greece, Italy and Portugal, adding to the pressures already straining European unity.   ""It reinforces a shift that we have seen in recent years for Germany to become rather more focused on its own national interests rather than sacrificing for some defined European interest,"" said Kevin Featherstone, an expert on E.U. politics at the London School of Economics. ""Germany is not giving up on Europe, but it is certainly frustrated.""   German politics are in line with the interests of German businesses like Fresenius, a health care company in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt. Last year, Fresenius recorded a sales increase in Asia of 20 percent, to  1.3 billion, or $1.8 billion. That compared with its sales in Europe of  6.5 billion, up 8 percent.   Fresenius's chief executive, Mark Schneider, said he expected the trend to continue, noting that China was trying to create a universal health care system that would ensure its people access to kidney dialysis and infusion therapies -- the sort of products that Fresenius provides.   Germany, of course, remains deeply entwined with the euro zone, which is still its largest source of trade by far. But Western Europe's share in the German pie is shrinking as companies focus new investment on more vibrant markets.   ""I'm not sure I would call Germany the locomotive"" for Europe anymore, said Marc Lhermitte, a partner at the consulting firm Ernst & Young. ""It's an engine.""   Mr. Lhermitte was one of the directors of a study in May by the firm that looked at trends in cross-border investment around the world.   Last year, the euro area's share of German exports fell to 41 percent from 43 percent in 2008, while Asia's share rose to 16 percent from 12 percent, according to Bundesbank figures. During the same period, exports to Asia rose by  28 billion, while exports to the euro area fell by the same amount.   Fresenius is one of many companies that reflect the trend. Corporate investment in Western Europe is still rising in absolute terms, said Mr. Schneider, but ""capital spending and employment is not rising as much as we are seeing in emerging markets.""   There are also signs that Germany's prosperity is no longer helping the rest of Europe the way it did a few years ago. On the contrary, the rest of Europe, particularly its southern half, is falling further behind as the European Union struggles to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.   The Italian economy, for example, is no longer cruising in Germany's slipsteam.   ""Italy used to produce a lot of goods that would feed the German industrial machine,"" said Jens Sondergaard, an economist at Nomura in London. But much of that German business is going to Eastern Europe or elsewhere, where costs are lower and companies are increasingly able to match Italian quality. Indeed, despite the strong German economy, Italian exports to Germany were  3.2 billion lower in 2010 than in 2008.   ""That is bad news for Italy,"" Mr. Sondergaard said.   Where Germany puts its money is crucial to the 17-nation euro zone economy. Germany accounts for nearly a third of the euro area's exports. Germany has a trade surplus so far this year, while France, Italy, Spain and the region as a whole have large deficits.   With decades of European economic integration under their belt, German companies still exported much more to France last year than to China --  91 billion compared with  54 billion.   But the gap is closing fast. Exports to China rose 44 percent in 2010 compared with a 12 percent increase for France. Mr. Wen, the prime minister, predicted during his visit to Berlin last month that trade with Germany would double within five years.   Moreover, in 2009, German manufacturers for the first time invested more in China --  11.6 billion, a 50 percent increase from 2006 -- than they did in France, which, along with Italy and Spain, is drawing markedly less German industrial investment than a few years ago.   This profound shift is visible at the Trumpf factory complex in Ditzingen, near Stuttgart. Not long ago, Trumpf was considered part of the Mittelstand, the midsize, family-owned engineering companies that power the German economy. But these days, Trumpf is a global powerhouse.   From humble prewar beginnings, Trumpf, a maker of machines that use lasers to work metal, has grown to the point where it now employs about 2,000 people in Ditzingen and 6,000 at other locations around the world. That is not counting the robotic lawnmower prowling outside the executive office building -- a sign of the scarcity of labor in southwestern Germany, where unemployment is less than 5 percent.   There are a number of reasons for Trumpf's growth from workshop to multinational, but one stands out: China. As at many other German companies, sales to China and other developing markets have made up for declines in traditional export markets that followed the recession in 2009.   ""In three to five years, China will be our biggest market,"" said Mathias Kammuller, a member of the company's management board and head of the machine-tools division.   In 2009, Trumpf opened a factory of 15,000 square meters, or 160,000 square feet, in Taicang, near Shanghai. Less than two years later, the company ran out of space and expanded the plant by another 10,000 square meters. There are so many companies from southwestern Germany in that part of China that it is known as Little Swabia, referring to a region of Germany.   Trumpf has hired about 450 employees in China, more than half the number it has in the euro area outside of Germany, where by contrast employment has been flat.   ""We are not producing in China to be less expensive or to export to Europe,"" said Nicola Leibinger-Kammuller, the president of Trumpf, who is married to Mr. Kammuller. ""We are producing for the Chinese market.""   Trumpf is by no means alone. China is by far the biggest market for Germany's crucial machine-tool industry, as manufacturers abroad equip their factories with precision technology from Bavaria or the Ruhr Valley.   The success of German exports in emerging markets reflects its manufacturers' strength in making things that go into the kinds of products that a modernizing economy needs, like trains, steel factories, and electronics assembly lines.   ""Our newest plants are in Russia, China and India,"" said Heinrich Weiss, chief executive of SMS Group, a company in Dusseldorf that builds and equips steel and aluminum plants. ""Western Europe and the United States are very quiet -- very quiet.""   Another example of a company that has prospered with the rise of emerging markets is Multivac, based in Wolfertschwenden, in southern Germany. The company makes machines for packaging perishable goods, a business that is possible only in countries where food can be kept cool from the factory to store shelves. So Multivac is something of an indicator of the advance of reliable electrical power and rising incomes.   Hans-Joachim Boekstegers, the president of Multivac, said he spent 150 days away from home in the last year, visiting new markets like Azerbaijan, Chile and Turkey.   Mr. Boekstegers said he still had plenty of business in Europe, even Greece. ""People always need to eat,"" he said. But that is not where the big growth is found.   ""I can only recommend,"" Mr. Boekstegers said, ""that everyone not be dependent on European business and expand abroad.""   Even within Europe, there is a shift from west to east, with German manufacturers concentrating more of their investment in countries like Hungary and Slovakia.   Germany's shift toward developing markets has been brewing for a long time, but it accelerated after the 2009 downturn, when Asia recovered much more quickly than Europe or the United States. ""In China the crisis lasted only half a year, followed by extreme growth,"" said Mr. Kammuller of Trumpf.   Germany's lessening dependence on the euro area economy appears to have given Mrs. Merkel more leeway to be assertive with her European allies, clashing repeatedly, for example, with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France on issues like Greece and Libya.   When Mrs. Merkel was first elected chancellor in 2005, she rarely invited German executives to accompany her on trips to China, Russia -- or anywhere else, for that matter. Now Mrs. Merkel frequently leads trips abroad, particularly to Asia. At the end of May, she made a three-day trip to India and Singapore, with a retinue of top executives in tow.   Mrs. Merkel has used her influence to open doors and help companies deal with the hazards of developing markets, which remain much riskier than Europe. Managers have urged Mrs. Merkel to criticize poor protection of intellectual property rights in China, and she has obliged. At one meeting with German and Chinese executives, she wondered aloud whether parts of a new Volkswagen model had already been counterfeited.   But Mrs. Merkel is not just an exponent for German business. She has annoyed executives by criticizing human rights violations by China. German managers were furious with her after she met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, in 2007. Despite threats by the Chinese authorities, there was no major effect on trade, however, and Mrs. Merkel has not said much about Tibet recently.   Some analysts warn that Germany is focusing too much on developing markets, and setting itself up for a shock if the Chinese economy slows down. China is also trying to build up its expertise in cars and machinery and become a competitor as well as a customer. Business people are aware of the risk.   Still, said Mrs. Leibinger-Kammuller of Trumpf, ""it is riskier not to be there.""   Judy Dempsey reported from Berlin.    First in a series on Germany's changing role in Europe and the world.

2936,2008723314.xml,"BERLIN -- Germany's highest administrative court ruled on Tuesday that vehicles can be banned from some city streets as part of efforts to improve air quality in urban areas, a decision that could have far-reaching consequences for the country's automakers and the diesel technology they promoted for decades.Other European countries have taken measures to reduce the number of diesel-powered cars, but the technology is almost synonymous with Germany, where there are 15 million diesel cars on the streets and where automakers bet their futures on technology they billed as environmentally friendly, even as they rigged software in their cars to pass stringent emissions tests.Environmental groups welcomed the Federal Administrative Court's ruling, which was centered on efforts to limit emissions in Stuttgart but set a precedent for all cities in Germany. Although they predicted that bans could be in place in some cities by fall, many cities and automakers pointed to language in the ruling that suggested its ultimate effect was yet to be determined.The ruling called for ""proportionality,"" stipulating that only older models with the highest emissions could be subject to such bans and that other considerations had to be taken into account, but automakers warned that allowing individual cities to set their own rules could result in confusion for drivers.""Volkswagen has to accept the Federal Administrative Court's decision, but is unable to comprehend it,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it was ""unsettling for millions of motorists"" and ""completely unclear"" how the decision could be implemented.But Deutsche Umwelthilfe, an environmental and consumer rights organization that set the legal action in motion, cheered the ruling as a clear victory for residents of dozens of German cities who are suffering from respiratory and other health problems caused by air pollution.""The days of flooding the inner cities with poisonous diesel emissions are over,"" said Jürgen Resch, managing director of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. ""These vehicles have no place in our cities anymore.""Frustrated with the lack of progress in improving air quality in about 70 of the country's most polluted cities, the group brought lawsuits against several local governments, demanding that they uphold the air quality standards set by the European Union. In some instances, cities found that the only way to ensure those standards were met involved banning certain vehicles -- mostly older diesel models -- from city streets.Mr. Resch said he expected the first bans to be enacted in the fall in German cities where pollution levels are highest. Those cities include Stuttgart, home to Porsche and Mercedes, as well as Düsseldorf, both of which were directly involved in the case.""Limited bans for certain diesel cars are within the law,"" the court said in its ruling, as one way to allow cities to meet the limits on the emissions of nitrogen oxide established by the European Union in 2010.The court further found that when emissions exceeded the allowed limits, banning all vehicles with diesel motors older than those approved in 2014 and gasoline-burning engines older than those approved in 2001 was the only way for the municipal authorities to ensure air quality.In 2016, a lower court in Stuttgart ruled in favor of Deutsche Umwelthilfe's argument that the only way to effectively reduce nitrogen oxide levels in urban areas was to keep off the streets those vehicles responsible for the pollution, most of them diesels.But the state of Baden-Württemberg challenged the lower court's ruling, and a court in North Rhine-Westphalia urged a higher court to weigh in, arguing that only the federal government had the right to enforce the European Union standards.The ruling allowing such bans -- already popular among Germany's European neighbors -- could open the floodgates, allowing for a raft of new measures in other cities across the country. But resistance to steps that curb drivers' rights in Germany remains deeply rooted. Diesel technology was developed in the country, and it accounts for many of the 800,000 jobs in the German auto industry.Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor who runs an automotive research center at the University of Duisburg-Essen, warned the Germans who drive older diesel cars not to try to sell them, as the ruling was certain to send prices plunging. He criticized the government and auto industry for failing to take the problem of diesel emissions seriously enough when they met in Berlin in August.""Car and policymakers now need to put their heads together and finally come up with a solution for how we are going to get out of this mess,"" Mr. Dudenhöffer said.Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government has been under pressure for years to take a stronger stance against the powerful auto industry, tried to soothe the concerns of diesel owners. ""It only pertains to certain cities in which there is more negotiating to be done,"" the chancellor said after the ruling. ""But it certainly does not affect all of Germany and every person in the country who owns a vehicle.""Municipal groups have warned that allowing bans could be fatal for inner cities, where delivery, repair and emergency workers, as well as many residents, rely on diesel-fired vehicles.Diesel was sold for decades as a cleaner alternative to gas-fired engines on the argument that diesel cars were better for the environment because they burn fuel more efficiently and emit less carbon dioxide.But in 2015, the United States authorities revealed that Volkswagen had duped consumers by rigging its vehicles to pass emissions tests: Software cut emissions during tests in a controlled environment but turned off under normal driving conditions.Since then, the scandal has widened, most recently through revelations of a study in which VW forced monkeys to inhale fumes from a Beetle in an effort to prove they were not harmful.At the meeting in August, the German government ordered all carmakers to fix the problem, and they responded by proposing software that would keep emissions at laboratory levels while driving on the open road. But environmental groups have argued that these have failed to sufficiently reduce pollution.An alternative would be to retrofit some older vehicles, at a cost of 1,400 to 3,300 euros ($1,725 to $4,060), cutting diesel pollution by as much as 70 percent, according to Germany's auto safety group, ADAC.Customers are already turning away from diesel technology. The latest figures show a drop of more than 17 percent in the number of diesel-burning cars registered in January compared with December. The figures reflect a trend established in the previous year, and the authorities fear they indicate a threat to the industry.Like Stuttgart and Düsseldorf, Munich is also considering a ban. They would join European cities including Madrid and Athens, which have said they will ban all diesel vehicles by 2025. Britain and France have also said they want to end domestic sales of new diesel vehicles by 2040.Follow Melissa Eddy on Twitter:                           @meddynyt                        .Environmental activists outside federal administrative court in Leipzig, Germany last week.

2134,2540036394.xml,"Summit meetings are always full of prepackaged ""deliverables,"" but stage management always works better when there's an actual stage.PLYMOUTH, England -- Call it the much-welcomed death of Zoom diplomacy.President Biden and six leaders from the world's richest nations are meeting -- face-to-face -- in a picturesque, seaside resort in Cornwall, on England's southwestern shore. It is the first in-person global summit meeting since the coronavirus pandemic shut down travel and forced presidents and prime ministers to reach for the ""raise hand"" button, just like everyone else.So far, proximity appears to be working in favor of cooperation.Summit meetings are always full of prepackaged ""deliverables,"" but stage management always works better when there is an actual stage. So as Friday's summit opened, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who is not only hosting the gathering but lured most of the royal family to a formal dinner, announced that the Group of 7 nations would collectively donate one billion doses of the coronavirus vaccine to the developing world.It was a very conscious effort to show that the world's richest democracies can catch up with China's moves to establish itself as a leader in the fight against the coronavirus. The G7 pledge includes Mr. Biden's promise to deliver 500 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.But as the leaders gathered in hastily built meeting rooms just feet from a sandy shore, they were acutely aware that beyond the humanitarian gesture lay a big geopolitical move, coming as more than 260 million doses of China's Covid-19 vaccines have been sent to 95 countries, according to Bridge Consulting, a Beijing-based consultancy.The leaders gathered in Carbis Bay in Cornwall have also agreed, at least in concept, to Mr. Biden's proposal for a 15 percent minimum global tax to keep corporations from engaging in a race to the tax-burden bottom. And the group appears poised to issue a unanimous embrace of tougher emissions goals ahead of a major climate change summit this year.But the real sign that in-person diplomacy is back was Friday's dinner, with plenty of royalty, from Queen Elizabeth to Prince Charles, Prince William and Kate Middleton, who earlier in the day met with the first lady, Jill Biden, at a British school. They dined at the Eden Project, an environmental charity that features rain forests capped by several large biomes along Cornwell's shores.It was balm for Mr. Biden, who loved nothing more than jetting around the world as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and then as vice president -- a man who actually enjoyed roaming the halls of the famed Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where the Munich Security Conference is held each year. He could be seen, two hands on a diplomat's shoulder, making his point, persuading, posing for pictures.Then such travel all came to a crashing stop. He campaigned from his basement. Once elected, his aides had strict rules that no more than five people could be in a White House office at a time. Four months ago, Mr. Biden held his first work-from-home meeting with a world leader, conferring with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in the only viable way during a pandemic: a video call from the Roosevelt Room in the White House.More Zoom calls followed: a virtual meeting of a group known as the Quad, which includes the president, along with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan; and then a global climate summit ""hosted"" by Mr. Biden but conducted ""Brady Bunch"" style, with leaders stacked in video squares on big screens.He tiptoed into real, human visits, inviting Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan and then President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, to the White House for brief visits. (Chancellor Angela Merkel is next, the White House said Friday, coming for a farewell visit on July 15, just before she leaves office.)This week, the one-at-a-time meetings ended.Mr. Biden jetted across the Atlantic for an eight-day in-person round of global backslapping and private confrontations. On Friday, he attended the first day of a Group of 7 meeting with the leaders of the world's richest nations. Then comes a full meeting of NATO leaders, and of the European Union, before the trip's main event: a one-on-one face-off with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.""I don't think it's possible to overstate the importance of face-to-face diplomacy,"" said Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.""On the Zoom, you have no kind of sense of their movements and how they sit and various things that show what kind of person you are dealing with,"" she said. ""You can't judge what's going through their minds."" (The Munich conference, she noted, is ""a perfect setting for him,"" referring to Mr. Biden.)Richard Haass, a lifelong diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, agreed that face-to-face meetings are better than the alternative. ""I will leave to others to assess the diplomatic implications of Zoom only requiring leaders to be formally clothed from the waist up,"" he said.But Mr. Haass warned against reading too much into ""face-to-face meetings or personal diplomacy in general.""""Leaders are motivated by what they see as their own and their country's interests,"" he said. ""Diplomacy is a tool for advancing those interests, not for dispensing favors.""Mr. Haass noted that ""a face-to-face encounter can also give a leader too much confidence. Khrushchev erred when he concluded too much from his initial meeting with J.F.K. and later overplayed his hand, in the process bringing the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe,"" during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Of course, not all presidents have loved a summit the way Mr. Biden does. President Barack Obama disliked the endless pomp of the formal summits that he attended during his eight years in the White House, especially the substance-free moments like the ""family photo,"" where the world leaders stand stiffly next to one another while photographers snap their shots. (There was one, at the edge of the water, on Friday.)And there is always the possibility that a meeting can turn leaders sour on each other, as President Donald J. Trump proved during his time in office.His presence at global meetings, including G7s, caused consternation and confrontation as he clashed with America's allies. At the G7 in Quebec City in 2018, Mr. Trump refused to sign the leaders' statement, called Mr. Trudeau ""very dishonest and weak"" and was grumpy throughout -- as captured by a picture that showed him, hands crossed across his chest, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany leaning over a table with the other leaders standing by.But for Mr. Biden, it is different.Ms. Merkel, Mr. Trudeau and the other world leaders get along with Mr. Biden, even if their nations sometimes clash over issues. (Mr. Biden and Ms. Merkel disagree about the need for a Russian natural gas pipeline; Mr. Trudeau and others are not happy about the president's stand on trade and tariffs.)Mr. Biden appeared relaxed and happy at Carbis Bay. On Thursday evening, as the sun set, he gave a formal talk about the 500 million vaccines, then reappeared, sockless in sneakers with his wife, Jill, at the tables outside a small cafe with a waterfront view. He made small talk with those a little shocked to see him. And the mood was light when the leaders gathered outside for that required photo.""Everybody in the water,"" he said -- presumably joking.Queen Elizabeth speaking with President Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, during Friday's gathering of world leaders.

443,1675105552.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  Struggling to cope with a growing migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, European leaders promised on Thursday to triple their spending on border protection and approved plans to intensify efforts to root out smugglers' boats before they could set sail, among other measures. But experts and advocacy groups said the plans announced by leaders meeting in Brussels were far too small in scale to stem the flow of illegal migrants or prevent disasters like the capsizing of a ship carrying mostly African migrants off the coast of Libya last weekend, which killed as many as 900 people. Funerals for 24 of the victims were held Thursday in Malta, but few of the migrants' bodies have been recovered. Migrants from Africa and the Middle East, buffeted by war and abetted by ruthless smugglers, have been crossing the Mediterranean in increasing numbers in unseaworthy boats. Many never make it. Leaders' efforts to formulate a response are hindered by intense budget pressures, a patchwork of migration policies across the 28-member European Union and a simmering backlash against immigrants across the Continent. Officials said Thursday that the European Union planned to triple the budget of its Triton border protection operation, now at about 3 million euros, or $3.22 million, a month. The force now includes two aircraft, two helicopters, six coastal patrol boats and about 65 officers, bloc officials said. But experts and nongovernmental organizations said the problem's scale and root causes had not been addressed. Amnesty International noted that the Triton operation patrols only within 30 miles of the Italian and Maltese coasts, far from where many of the deaths at sea occur. Others contended that extending the search-and-rescue program could encourage even more desperate migrants to try to reach Europe. ""The E.U. hasn't had a coherent immigration policy since forever, and the situation is getting worse since the Arab Spring,"" said Camino Mortera-Martinez, a research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London.  The European Union's cautious approach was illustrated by a proposal for a resettlement program that would include 5,000 places for migrants who qualify for ""protection."" But with thousands arriving recently in a single week, human rights groups said that such a proposal was woefully inadequate. In 2013, 107,000 people were detected trying to enter the European Union, up from 75,000 in 2012, according to Frontex, the union's border agency. About 1,727 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Before the meeting in Brussels, United Nations agencies and the migration organization issued a joint plea for moral and political leadership in responding to ""a tragedy of epic proportions,"" and criticized the bloc's approach as being ""minimalist."" Amnesty International, reacting to draft summit conclusions, called the proposals a pitifully ""inadequate and shameful response."" As Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany arrived at the summit meeting on Thursday, she said, ""First and foremost now, we have to save lives and take the right measures to do so.""  While expressions of solidarity and good intentions were on wide display in Brussels, European Union leaders nevertheless remained circumscribed in their ability to act, with lingering unemployment in some countries fanning resentment of immigrants. They also face pressures from far-right parties -- including the National Front in France, Jobbik in Hungary and the U.K. Independence Party in Britain -- which have gained in popularity by railing against immigration. Political pressures aside, the union's plan would do little to address one of the central problems: the lawlessness in much of Libya, which has become the primary staging point for vessels carrying people toward Europe. And some critics said the bloc's proposals would leave the authorities along Europe's southern tier with inadequate powers and equipment to stop migrant vessels early in their voyages and traffickers based along the north coast of Africa. Efforts to forge a common immigration policy across Europe have been held back by divergent national approaches conditioned by geography, culture and history. The debate over how to proceed has in some ways also broken down along regional lines, with southern nations, led by Italy and including Greece and Spain, demanding more money and more action from the richer and more powerful nations, led by Germany. The scale of last weekend's tragedy has dented some countries' reticence. Britain, which had been stymied by a toxic debate on immigration ahead of a general election next month, said Thursday that it was offering a Royal Navy warship, three helicopters and two border control vessels to help with search-and-rescue missions. But the British government underlined that it would not be taking in additional refugees. Germany, which had more than 200,000 asylum seekers last year -- almost a third of the claims made in the European Union -- wants the burden of housing and aiding asylum seekers to be more evenly distributed across the bloc. Some Central and Eastern European nations, which saw little immigration in Communist times, have been slow to adapt to the demands of European integration. Ms. Mortera-Martinez of the Center for European Reform said that a robust overhaul of immigration policy was needed, including an update of regulations that require migrants to apply for asylum in the countries in which they arrive. That, she noted, has imposed an unfair burden on the southern countries on the front lines of the migration flow. Beyond the challenge of forging a united policy, the European Union's creaking institutions are ill suited to rapid response, experts said, given that changes to immigration policy can take years. Thomas Huddleston, program director at the Migration Policy Group in Brussels, said European governments consider immigration policy a matter of national sovereignty, ""and now suddenly the E.U. has to act at light speed."" The human cost of the region's migration crisis was underlined Thursday when prosecutors in Catania, Sicily, revealed more details about the boat whose capsizing last weekend killed hundreds.  Before the boat left Libya, the smugglers kept as many as 1,200 migrants on a farm near Tripoli, prosecutors said. Survivors described having been beaten and abused. Armed men in uniforms guarded the farm, prosecutors said, and one person reported seeing exchanges of money to men who appeared to be police officers. On the day of the departure, the smugglers transferred the migrants to a beach and used rubber inflatable boats to transfer them to the larger vessel. At one point, according to a survivor, the smugglers continued to brutalize some of the passengers: In one instance, a boy stood, apparently without permission, and the smugglers killed him and tossed his body overboard.

1168,1508902074.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDBRUSSELS --  When antigovernment protesters first took to the streets of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, late last year, José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Union's executive arm, applauded the demonstrators for ""writing the new narrative"" for a 28-nation bloc weighed down by economic gloom and growing public skepticism about its purpose. Three months on, with those same pro-European protesters now victorious but their country at risk of being dismembered by Russia, Ukraine's political tumult has instead brought back an old story line -- a confrontation redolent of the Cold War that has only underscored Europe's divisions and exposed the chasm between the bloc's high-minded aspirations and the rough reality of geopolitics as practiced by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. European Union leaders gathered Thursday in Brussels to consider further responses to Russia's annexation of Crimea and steps to discourage Mr. Putin from additional encroachments into Ukraine. Divided by the economic and political interests of individual countries, they added 12 new names to a list of Russians and pro-Moscow Ukrainians hit by an asset freeze and travel ban announced in Brussels on Monday. Officials said the new names on the expanded blacklist included ""really high-ranking"" Russians and would be made public Friday. It was not known whether some or all of the people to be named are the same individuals signaled out by the United States for sanctions earlier on Thursday.  But, despite moves by Russia in recent days to formally seize Crimea, European leaders backed away from acting on their March 6 threat to impose broad economic sanctions if Moscow took ""further steps to destabilize the situation in Ukraine."" They kept the threat alive by ordering preparations for a raft of possible restrictions on trade, economic and financial ties with Russia. For years before Ukraine fractured, European leaders went out of their way to reassure Moscow that their approach to Ukraine would pose no threat -- that it was not the zero-sum game that Mr. Putin ultimately saw it to be. That approach clearly failed, and the question now is not just how, but whether they can draw a firmer line. ""The European Union definitely miscalculated about Russia's reaction,"" said Linus Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, a Baltic state with a long and painful history of living in Moscow's shadow. ""When you play soccer there are rules of the game, but the other side turned out to be playing rugby with a bit of wrestling.""  Anchored in elaborate rules and regulations, the European Union has repeatedly been caught off guard not only by Russia's blunt methods and its disdain for established borders but also by the pace of unforeseen events in Ukraine.  These started last November when the president then, Viktor F. Yanukovych, abruptly spurned a sweeping trade and political accord with Europe. But his decision was not entirely unforeseeable. The European Union's own intelligence analysis unit, Intcen, predicted in a secret report weeks before that Mr. Yanukovych would not sign the deal. According to diplomats involved in Europe's policy toward Ukraine, so much bureaucratic energy had been invested in bringing Ukraine into the bloc's so-called Eastern Partnership program that wishful thinking prevailed over hardheaded calculation, especially since Mr. Yanukovych and his allies repeatedly restated their commitment to embrace Europe in the months ahead of his about-face. Brussels seemed to become locked inside its own minutely calibrated bureaucratic mechanism and shut out events that threatened to throw grit in the works. When Stefan Fule, the union's enlargement commissioner and one of its main interlocutors with Ukraine, visited Kiev in mid-November, Mr. Yanukovych told him clearly, according to officials in Kiev and Brussels, that he was having serious second thoughts about signing the long-planned association agreement with Europe at a summit meeting scheduled for the end of that month in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Mr. Fule, upon his return to Brussels, informed ambassadors privately of the possible setback but in a public statement issued Nov. 20 made no mention of any potential trouble and instead hailed the ""determination"" of Mr. Yanukovych and his allies. Mr. Linkevicius, the Lithuanian foreign minister, said that Mr. Yanukovych had sent so many mixed signals about his intentions that it was impossible to know what he intended to do. From 2008, when the European Union began its Eastern Partnership scheme, Europe's efforts to extend democratic values and free trade to Ukraine and five other countries in the former Soviet Union were based on calculations that turned out to be wrong. ""We knew that we were heading for some issues with the Russians,"" said Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister and an architect of the eastward push, along with the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski. ""But we have seen a different Russia emerging, during the last year in particular, than many anticipated."" In its dealings with Russia, Mr. Bildt added, ""We did two things wrong in retrospect."" The first, he said, was not to take issue with Moscow's increasingly assertive claims since 2009 in its military doctrine that it had a right to protect Russians living outside the country, particularly in former Soviet lands. The second was Europe's muted reaction when Russia started last year to block the import of Ukrainian goods and threatened severe hardship if Kiev signed the trade and political pact with Brussels. A senior diplomat in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity following diplomatic protocol, said that Europe had stumbled badly by reducing its outreach to Ukraine to a ""technocratic and bloodless"" exercise that ignored political realities. Britain and France, he added, ""are the only member states that still understand hard power as opposed to the E.U. technocratic approach of ignoring the political dimension."" But officials in the Brussels headquarters of the European Commission, the union's executive arm, say it was difficult to raise the alarm over Russian pressure last year because Ukraine itself kept mostly quiet about it until Mr. Yanukovych suddenly told Mr. Füle in November that trade restrictions imposed by Moscow had slashed key industrial sectors in Ukraine by 40 percent. To some degree, the current clash is a result of the success of the early efforts to integrate Poland and the Baltic States into the West. ""Everyone thought the Eastern Partnership was just another flabby European project,"" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington and co-author of a political biography of Mr. Putin. ""But once a country signs up, it is in Weight Watchers and, if they follow the regimen, they change,"" she said. ""Russia realized this and did not like it.""  Indeed, she added, Russia had already been deeply alarmed by the transformation of countries like Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after they entered the European Union in 2004. The Baltic states, formerly part of the Soviet Union, joined the European Union within a few weeks of their admission to NATO, a sequence that strengthened Moscow's view that Brussels served as a stalking horse for the American-led military alliance. In the case of Ukraine, Europe never offered even the possibility of it one day joining the European Union, and NATO dropped Ukraine as a potential future member back in 2008. This raised hopes in Brussels that Moscow might not object too strongly, and Russia initially expressed little unease about Europe's Eastern Partnership plans. But after Mr. Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012, after four years as prime minister, previous talk of shared interests in free trade and close cooperation gave way to increasingly forceful calls for the establishment of a Moscow-dominated rival to the European Union called the Eurasian Union. By last summer, Moscow began a campaign of pressure to dissuade former Soviet lands, including Ukraine, from siding with Europe. Of the six former Soviet republics that Brussels had hoped to pull into its orbit, only two, Moldova and Georgia, are still on track to sign association agreements with the European Union on schedule this summer. But that could easily change if Moscow ratchets up economic and other pressure to make them reconsider, as it did with Ukraine. Ukraine now says it wants to revive the deal spurned by Mr. Yanukovych, but has been told by Europe that this will not be possible until it holds new elections in May. Instead, Europe has offered Ukraine a partial deal that will be sealed on Friday. Asked how historians will judge Europe's efforts to expand its law-abiding ways eastward, Mr. Linkevicius, Lithuania's foreign minister, said: ""At some distance, we will see how we are weak, how we are inconsistent. We are doing a lot of things too little and too late.""

555,1934953170.xml,"CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- North Korea's detonation of a sixth nuclear bomb on Sunday prompted the Trump administration to warn that even the threat to use such a weapon against the United States and its allies ""will be met with a massive military response.""The test -- and President Trump's response -- immediately raised new questions about the president's North Korea strategy and opened a new rift with a major American ally, South Korea, which Mr. Trump criticized for its ""talk of appeasement"" with the North.The underground blast was by far North Korea's most powerful ever. Though it was far from clear that the North had set off a hydrogen bomb, as it claimed, the explosion caused tremors that were felt in South Korea and China. Experts estimated that the blast was four to sixteen times more powerful than any the North had set off before, with far more destructive power than the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.Yet after a day of meetings in the Situation Room involving Mr. Trump and his advisers, two phone calls between the president and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and even demands from some liberal Democrats to cut off North Korea's energy supplies, Mr. Trump's aides conceded that they faced a familiar conundrum.While the Pentagon has worked up a series of military options for targeted strikes at North Korea's nuclear and missile sites, Mr. Trump was told that there is no assurance that the United States could destroy them all in a lightning strike, according to officials with knowledge of the exchange. Cyberstrikes, which President Barack Obama ordered against the North's missile program, have also been judged ineffective.Mr. Trump hinted at one extreme option: In a Twitter post just before he met his generals, he said that ""the United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.""Taken literally, such a policy would be tantamount to demanding a stoppage of any Chinese oil to North Korea, essentially an attempt to freeze out the country this winter and bring whatever industry it has to a halt.The Chinese would almost certainly balk; they have never been willing to take steps that might lead to the collapse of the North Korean regime, no matter how dangerous its behavior, for fear that South Korean and American troops would occupy the country and move directly to the Chinese border.Beyond that, the economic disruption of ending all trade with China would be so huge inside the United States that Mr. Trump's aides declined on Sunday to discuss the implications.After meeting with Mr. Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emerged to warn North Korea that ""any threat to the United States or its territory, including Guam or our allies, will be met with a massive military response."" But Mr. Mattis, in a terse statement delivered on the White House driveway with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., also offered a word of reassurance to the North's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un.""We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea,"" he said. ""But as I said, we have many options to do so.""The statement echoed past comments by the defense secretary as well as a warning issued by President George W. Bush after North Korea's first atomic test, in 2006. In that statement, Mr. Bush also said North Korea would be held responsible if it ever exported any of its nuclear weapons technology to other nations or to terrorists.Still, Mr. Mattis's statement left open many questions. His formulation seemed to rule out the kind of ""preventive war"" that the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, warned last month might be necessary after the North tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in an effort to demonstrate that it could reach Los Angeles and beyond. Instead, Mr. Mattis seemed to be talking about ""pre-emptive strikes,"" which the United States might order if it determined that an attack seemed imminent.There was no public discussion of pursuing a diplomatic opening to the North. Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson raised such a possibility two weeks ago, after a brief lull in North Korea's testing. That statement turned out to be optimistic at best. The North has shown no interest in engaging with the United States unless the Americans end their military presence in the South.To the contrary, the North Korean leader has tried to portray his nuclear program as unstoppable and nonnegotiable, posing by a picture of what the North's official news agency on Sunday called a hydrogen bomb that could be fitted into the nose cone of the ICBMs tested last month. Experts warned that the weapon, while shaped like a hydrogen bomb, could well have been a mock-up or decoy, one of the many steps the North takes to make it appear more powerful than it truly is.On Monday, South Korea's army fired short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast in a simulated attack on North Korea's nuclear test site, its military said in a statement. F-15K fighter jets also joined in the show of force, firing air-to-land missiles, it said.Only hours earlier, Mr. Trump reacted to the North Korean test by lashing out at South Korea.""North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success,"" he said. ""South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!""Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to the offers by South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, to enter into some kind of negotiations with the North that might lead to a renewal of the ""Sunshine Policy,"" an effort by some of his predecessors to lure the North into disarmament with economic engagement. Those efforts failed.Mr. Moon said recently that he had obtained a promise from Washington that the United States would never take military action without Seoul's approval -- a commitment the Trump administration has never confirmed.Mr. Trump's undisguised swipe at the South for ""appeasement"" was certain to exacerbate fears that the United States might put it in danger. And it came only a day after Mr. Trump threatened a new rift in relations with suggestions that the United States might withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea -- one that was intended to bolster the alliance.In response to Mr. Trump's criticism, Mr. Moon's office said it was working closely with Washington to exert ""maximum sanctions and pressure."" But it also reiterated that the allies shared the understanding that the goal of these sanctions and pressure was to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.""We have experienced an internecine war and can never tolerate another catastrophic war on this land,"" Mr. Moon's office said in a statement. ""We will not give up our goal of working together with allies to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""While Washington and Seoul argue over the threat of military force, Mr. Kim seems determined to forge ahead. He has conducted more than 80 missile tests since taking over the country. And four of the six nuclear tests have been on his watch.This was the biggest, by far. The United States Geological Survey estimated that the tremor set off by the blast, detected at 12:36 p.m. at the Punggye-ri underground test site in northeastern North Korea, had a magnitude of 6.3.The South Korean Defense Ministry's estimate was much lower, at 5.7, but even that would mean a blast ""five to six times"" as powerful as the North's last nuclear test, a year ago, said Lee Mi-sun, a senior analyst at the South Korean Meteorological Administration.The South's National Fire Agency, which operates an emergency hotline, said it had received 31 calls about buildings and the ground shaking, the first time that South Koreans had reported tremors after a North Korean nuclear detonation.The blast was so powerful that the first tremor was followed by a second, weaker one minutes later, which the United States Geological Survey called a ""collapse,"" probably a cave-in at the North's underground test site.Condemnation of the test came from around the world.China, the North's main ally and biggest trading partner, expressed ""strong condemnation"" of the test, according to Xinhua, the state news agency, but suggested no new action. Its leaders feel as stymied as their American counterparts, according to many China experts.The test's timing was a major embarrassment for President Xi Jinping of China, who on Sunday was hosting a summit meeting of the so-called BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a United States-based research group specializing in North Korea, said the test seemed intended to jolt Mr. Xi and convince him that he needed to persuade the United States to talk to North Korea.Japan requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, as it did earlier in the week after a missile test over Hokkaido, its northernmost island.In Europe, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that North Korea ""deserves absolute condemnation,"" and a joint statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said ""the most recent provocation from Pyongyang reaches a new dimension.""The International Atomic Energy Agency said the test amounted to a ""complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community.""The timing of the test on Sunday was almost certainly no coincidence: It came during the American Labor Day weekend, and the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean government is next Saturday.In the coming days, the government is expected to organize huge rallies to celebrate the bomb test and Mr. Kim's leadership.""Pyongyang has a playbook of strategic provocations, throws off its adversaries through graduated escalation, and seeks maximum political impact by conducting weapons tests on major holidays,"" said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.But it also exaggerates its power. After its fourth nuclear test, in January 2016, North Korea claimed to have used a hydrogen bomb. Other countries dismissed the claim for lack of evidence, but experts have said that the North may have tested a ""boosted"" atomic bomb that used tritium, a common enhancement technique that produces a higher explosive yield.Analysts noted that the device in the photo that the North released on Sunday -- whether real or a mock-up -- was shaped like a two-stage thermonuclear device. David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said he doubted the device was real, but he said there was strong evidence that the North had been working on thermonuclear weapons.""The size of the seismic signal of the recent test suggests a significantly higher explosive yield than the fifth test,"" Mr. Albright said. ""Getting this high of a yield would likely require thermonuclear material in the device."" But he said he was ""skeptical that this design has been miniaturized to fit reliably on a ballistic missile.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2312,2501189762.xml,"Voters choosing regional governments in southwestern states punished the conservative party of Chancellor Angela Merkel after a series of scandals.BERLIN -- Voters in two southwestern German states punished Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party in regional elections on Sunday, early results showed, turning from the Christian Democrats in record numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic and a growing scandal over lawmakers who accepted kickbacks for selling masks.The elections in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate were the first in a year that will see voting for new legislators in four more states, and for the country's Parliament. In September, Germans will choose a new chancellor and government to take over Europe's largest economy after 16 years under Ms. Merkel's leadership.Projections based on partial vote counts showed the conservative party poised to lose support in both states. The results pointed to challenges the party faces in trying to restore confidence lost after three conservative lawmakers -- including one representing a district in Baden-Württemberg -- were forced to resign after revelations they had received compensation worth tens of thousands of euros for arranging the sale of medical-grade masks to municipalities when supplies were tight.""Today was not a good election evening for the Christian Democratic Union,"" Paul Ziemiak, secretary general of the party, said Sunday at a news conference after the polls had closed. ""We wanted to see better results.""The Christian Democrats saw support drop by at least four percentage points compared with 2016 in the state of Baden-Württemberg and more than five percentage points in Rhineland-Palatinate, according to projections. Although the party came in second place, the losses still amounted to the worst showing since the end of World War II for the conservatives in each of the states.The Greens, by contrast, made gains in both states, reflecting the party's steadily growing popularity. That could help it emerge as the strongest force in the September national election, raising the prospect that Germany could see its first Greens chancellor.""Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, the conservatives have built up an image of being Germany's indispensable natural government party; this image is fading,"" said Arne Jungjohann, a political scientist who is close to the Greens party. ""The conservatives no longer have a lock on the chancellorship.""In Baden-Württemberg, voters gave Winfried Kretschmann of the Greens a third term in office, with projections showing the party in the lead with nearly a third of the vote. It ran a campaign largely focused on his personality. Under the slogan ""You know me,"" Mr. Kretschmann, 72, promised to continue his party's consensus-seeking policies of the past five years.Voters in neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate also sought to return the incumbent governor to office, with the Social Democrats emerging as the strongest party by taking roughly a third of the vote, early results showed. Based on those figures, the Social Democrats would be able to continue their coalition government, led by Malu Dreyer, with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.Sunday's voting took place after largely muted campaigns that were overshadowed by the threat of the coronavirus and driven online by lockdowns. Germany has seen a recent increase in infections in recent days, and fewer voters turned out in both states compared with five years ago. At least half the ballots in each state were submitted by mail.The Alternative for Germany, or AfD, also suffered losses in both states, preliminary results showed, although the party remained the third-largest force in each of the states.The party blamed a recent attempt by the German domestic intelligence service to place it under observation on suspicion of posing a threat to the Constitution. Yet despite the AfD's populist, anti-establishment stance, the party has not been able to capitalize on growing criticism of the government's inability to secure enough vaccines and its patchwork reliance on lockdowns.Three conservative lawmakers in the federal Parliament have resigned over the mask scandal, including a member of the Christian Democratic Union representing a district in Baden-Württemberg. Another conservative lawmaker from the state of Thuringia, as well as a member of the Christian Social Union, the conservative party in the state of Bavaria, also resigned.After the payouts came to light, party leaders required all 240 conservative lawmakers to sign a declaration pledging they had not used their positions for financial gain in connection with fighting the pandemic.The conservatives' poor showing could pose a challenge to Armin Laschet, who took over as leader of the Christian Democratic Union in January. Many in the party are not certain he will become the candidate in the race to replace Ms. Merkel.Normally the party would put forward its leader as the candidate in the race for the chancellor, but Mr. Laschet has so far proved to be less popular with the German public than the governor of Bavaria, Markus Söder, who could instead be tapped as the conservative candidate.Mr. Söder has raised his profile as someone who has taken tough, decisive action to halt the spread of the virus in his state, closing the border to Austria and sending vaccines to help the beleaguered Czech Republic. Mr. Söder is also the head of the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, which forms a conservative bloc with the Christian Democrats in Parliament.""Today is not a good day for Armin Laschet,"" Marcel Dirsus, a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University, wrote on Twitter. ""These are the first important elections since he became C.D.U. leader and the results are disastrous.""Mr. Laschet has said conservatives will decide in the coming months whether the head of the Christian Democratic Union or the head of the Christian Social Union will run in September as the conservative bloc's candidate for chancellor. But the Christian Democrats' poor showing on Sunday could accelerate that decision.Whoever is selected will face the Greens' candidate, who has yet to be named, and Germany's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, who is running for the Social Democrats.Support for the Greens across Germany has nearly doubled since the election in 2017, making it the second strongest party six months before the national election, after the conservatives and ahead of the Social Democrats.Above right, Winfried Kretschmann of the Greens was a projected winner.

1638,922734062.xml,"      FRANKFURT -- Torsten Emmel may have looked like an innocent florist, a gentle guy with a shaved head and an apron, clipping the stems of fresh freesia. In fact, he was on the verge of breaking the law.   Mr. Emmel's crime: Setting a placard on the sidewalk outside his shop advertising that he would stay open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. It was, after all, Mother's Day. But a city inspector noticed the sign and warned Mr. Emmel that it was illegal to stay open so long on a Sunday. Close earlier or be fined, the inspector said.   It was a lesson in how, despite its vaunted industrial sector, the German economy suffers from some of the same overregulation and sclerosis usually associated with much more troubled European countries.   ""On special days, I don't think one should watch the clock so closely,"" Mr. Emmel said last week, still grumpy months later about the lost sales.   Germany is rightly known for Porsches and BMWs that are coveted by affluent buyers around the world, as well as much of the machinery that keeps factories running from China to Michigan.   Alongside the export juggernaut, though, is another, creakier economy that operates well below its potential and holds back not only Germany but the rest of Europe, some economists say.   This economy is overregulated, intended to insulate insiders from competition and deeply resistant to change. Though Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, often harangues countries like Spain, Italy and Greece to become more competitive, the German economy features some of the same flaws that they do, including protected professions and zoning laws that favor existing businesses over new ones.   ""Germany has what I would call a dual economy,"" said Andreas Worgotter, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.    ""On one side, we have this very dynamic, innovative, competitive and refreshingly unsubsidized export sector,"" he said. ""On the other side, there is a much less glamorous services sector which depends on barriers to entry, subsidies and not developing and reaching out for new activities.""   Mr. Worgotter oversaw an O.E.C.D report issued last week that amounted to a warning to German leaders not to get complacent. Though the German economy grew a healthy 3 percent last year, it will grow only 0.6 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2013, the O.E.C.D. forecast.   On Wednesday, a survey of purchasing managers by the research firm Markit, a closely watched indicator of business sentiment, said that German manufacturing was slowing.    At the end of 2011, the German economy, the world's fourth-largest, shrank for the first time since 2009. The decline in the fourth quarter of 0.2 percent was not as bad as expected, and growth has probably resumed. Still, most economists do not expect brisk growth to return any time soon.   Germany could add about 10 percent to growth over the next decade if it removed barriers to competition and other inefficiencies, according to the O.E.C.D. Surprisingly, the untapped potential in Germany was almost as high as that in Italy and higher than that in Spain, according to the O.E.C.D., an indication that the German domestic economy is not as superior to its southern neighbors as is often assumed.   Germany's huge trade surplus, more than 145 billion euros in the first 11 months of 2011, was partly a tribute to exporters like Siemens, Bosch and Daimler. But it also reflected chronically anemic spending by consumers and businesses on imports.   If Germany built up its services sector, it might buy more products from hard-pressed trading partners like Greece or Spain, whose debt problems are closely tied to their longstanding trade deficits. Everybody would win, the argument goes.   Germany would also become less vulnerable to the economic ups and downs of major markets like America and China, said Ulf M. Schneider, chief executive of Fresenius, a German health care company that is the world's largest provider of dialysis products and services. Mr. Schneider said he worried about Germany's dependence on the auto industry.   ""If there was a more resilient domestic economy, it would at least cushion things a little bit,"" Mr. Schneider said.   The barriers to entrepreneurship in Germany are often obscure, but cumulatively act as a significant drag on job creation and investment.   For example, two years after a promised deregulation of domestic transportation, intercity long-distance bus service is still effectively prohibited in Germany. The decades-old ban shielded the government-owned rail company, Deutsche Bahn.   ""It's frustrating,"" said Michael Svedek, chief operating officer of Deutsche Touring, a bus company based in Frankfurt that offers direct service to foreign cities like Istanbul or Belgrade, Serbia, but is still not allowed to operate domestic lines to, say, Munich.   Legislation to open up the market has been creeping through the German Parliament. ""Not a lot is going to happen before the end of the year,"" Mr. Svedek said.   Germany has made huge progress in the last decade toward removing strictures on the economy. In the 1990s, stores closed at 6:30 p.m. and were open only a few hours on Saturday, a hardship for working parents. Shops in train stations, which were exempt from the rules, were known to charge extortionate prices during off hours for essentials like disposable diapers.   Now, German states can set their own shop hours, and most have lifted restrictions during the workweek -- though Sunday is still taboo in most places. Florists and bakers are typically allowed to open a few hours on Sunday.   Germany has also eased strict licensing rules that required years of qualification even for professions like basket weaver or violin maker.   But years of training are still required to qualify as a house painter, chimney sweep or bicycle mechanic, to name a few examples. The O.E.C.D. has called on Germany to loosen restrictions on advertising and fees, which limit competition among architects, lawyers and engineers.   In 2005, Germany also changed rules to put more pressure on people to find jobs and make it easier for companies to hire temporary workers. Those changes contributed to a significant decline in the unemployment rate, to 7.3 percent in January from 13 percent in 2005. German unemployment remained low throughout the recession of 2009 and the debt crisis that followed.   Germany also has its public spending under better control than most of its neighbors. The German government budget deficit in 2011 was 1.1 percent of gross domestic product. At the same time, total debt is about average for the euro zone, equaling 80 percent of G.D.P.   But Germany's export success seems to have sapped political will to address remaining flaws in the economy, and could lead to a competitiveness gap several years from now.   Recent talk of the powerful German economy has obscured memories of how, not so long ago, the country was considered the sick man of Europe.   ""As great as the export performance is, we forget that we had a significant growth problem for 15 years before that,"" said Mr. Schneider, the Fresenius chief executive. ""If any of these stories come to an end, we are as exposed as anyone.""   A Bakery in Cologne. In Past Decades, Regulations Restricted Shopping Hours in Germany, Especially On Weekends.

2932,433849409.xml,"      The Dalai Lama arrived in London on Tuesday as part of a protracted foreign tour, highlighting efforts by European governments to balance China's hostility toward him against their support for human rights in Tibet.   At his previous stop in Germany, the Dalai Lama was received at a relatively low political level, met by only one government minister, in sharp contrast to last September when he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel. That meeting had prompted a long chill in relations with Beijing. This time, though, the chancellor was out of town on a weeklong tour of Latin America.    In London, Prime Minister Gordon Brown was embroiled in a debate over the level of warmth he should display toward China at the 2008 Summer Olympics in light of Beijing's recent crackdown on dissent in Tibet.   The Dalai Lama on Tuesday seemed eager to avoid inflaming the dispute with China, although he did refer to China's rule in Tibet at one point as totalitarian. The remark was made during a speech at London Metropolitan University, where he received an honorary degree. In unscripted remarks delivered in English, he was critical of China's role in education in his homeland.   ""In Tibet, although the Chinese did help in modern education,"" he said, ""the totalitarian system is one-sided, every field is much politicized. It does not give a complete form of education.""   According to the Dalai Lama's official program for his 11-day visit to Britain, he will meet Mr. Brown only at an  encounter with the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev.  Rowan Williams, at what the prime minister's office called ""an interfaith dialogue with several other religious leaders.""   Breaking with a tradition established by two  British prime ministers, John Major and Tony Blair, Mr. Brown will not receive the Dalai Lama at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence.   The scheduling inspired complaints from politicians and others who support Tibetans in their struggle against China, and who maintain that the British authorities have played down  the Dalai Lama's status to avoid conflict with China, a key trade partner.   ""Treating the Dalai Lama as only a religious leader simply ignores reality,"" said Sir Menzies Campbell, the former leader of the small opposition Liberal Democrats. ""There is no reason why he should not be received at No. 10 Downing Street.""   ""Many people will conclude that the prime minister is trying to have it both ways, to see him and not offend the Chinese government,"" Sir Menzies said.   Representatives of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign said Mr. Brown would be the first Western leader to meet the Dalai Lama since widespread protests and violence between Tibetans and the Chinese authorities in March. ""It is vital that the British government treat the Dalai Lama not just as a religious leader but also as a political figure,"" said Matt Whitticase, a representative of the campaign.   ""Gordon Brown is refusing to meet him in a political setting, underplaying his importance as a political leader especially at a time when his importance has been emphasized by the Tibetan people and people across the world,"" Mr. Whitticase told The Press Association, a  news agency. ""There is a deep-seated political problem in Tibet and the Dalai Lama holds the key, and he should therefore be met in a political setting.""   The Dalai Lama is on a three-month tour of five countries, including the United States, and he used his visit to Germany to underline his insistence that he is not seeking Tibet's independence from China.   But according to Agence France-Presse, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, warned Germany on Tuesday ""to not support in any form or connive with the Dalai's anti-China separatist activities on German soil.""   In Britain, the Dalai Lama is scheduled to give several speeches, to address a parliamentary foreign affairs panel and to speak to audiences in Nottingham and Oxford.   JOHN F.

2567,1155673345.xml,"       MOSCOW -- Just how strained the longstanding alliance between Russia and Germany has grown was evident here on Friday, as President Vladimir V. Putin batted away complaints by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, about Russia's human rights record.  Ms. Merkel arrived in St. Petersburg primed to press her counterpart on the battery of repressive measures he has introduced since returning to the presidency in May. She raised the case of the women in the punk band Pussy Riot who were sentenced to two years in prison for performing an anti-Putin song in a Moscow cathedral.  ""That would also be cause for discussion in Germany if it were to take place in a church -- no question,"" she said. ""But does that earn someone two years in a labor camp?"" Mr. Putin, who sometimes likes to throw his visitors off balance, parried her complaint about the band. ""One of the girls,"" he said, had staged the hanging in effigy of a Jew in a Moscow supermarket to send the message that Jews should leave the city. ""We cannot be with you in support of people who hold anti-Semitic positions,"" Mr. Putin said, as Ms. Merkel looked on, tight-lipped. Though what Mr. Putin said is not accurate -- the staged hanging was a performance intended as a protest against homophobia, racism and anti-Semitism -- it put Ms. Merkel in an exceedingly awkward position, and she gave no response. Russia has watched with irritation in recent months as the support of its closest Western European ally has weakened over the issue of human rights. Germany's special envoy on Russia, Andreas Schockenhoff, has criticized Mr. Putin's record so severely that Russia's Foreign Ministry has accused him of ""making defamatory remarks.""  As Ms. Merkel prepared to leave for Russia this week, lawmakers from her coalition urged her to rebuke Mr. Putin for cracking down on dissent. Ms. Merkel seemed poised to do so on Friday before private talks with Mr. Putin. ""I ask that not every bit of criticism is seen as destructive,"" she said. ""Open a German paper and read what is written there. If I were always getting offended, I would not even last three days in my job."" Mr. Putin parried, suggesting that Western policy makers might not have a firm grasp of what is going on in Russia. ""As for political and ideological issues, we hear our partners. But they hear about what is happening from very far away,"" he said. Mr. Putin has made it clear that he intends to reformulate Russia's relationship with the West: foreign powers will be welcome as trading partners, but excluded from any role in Russian domestic affairs.  Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the $120 billion in annual trade between Germany and Russia would serve as an ""air bag,"" making any serious breakdown in relations impossible. He said business interests would serve as a counterweight to the increasing number of German politicians calling for Berlin to distance itself from Moscow. ""It is not that this idea is being supported by everyone; there are lots of people in the Bundestag and government who, on the contrary, are in favor of further development of investment cooperation between the two countries,"" Mr. Peskov said. ""This economic basement influences the political house which stands on it."" Indeed, Ms. Merkel had substantial business to do in Moscow. Russian Railways signed an agreement on Friday with Siemens, the German company, to buy 675 locomotives, a deal that analysts say could be worth several billion dollars. A binding contract is likely to be signed no later than 2014, the news service Interfax reported.  Tensions were clearly mounting before the visit, when Mr. Peskov told reporters, ""We are well aware of the heightened anti-Russian rhetoric in Germany in recent weeks or even months."" Russia has said it no longer acknowledges the authority of Mr. Schockenhoff, and Agence France-Presse reported that his aides had said he had been denied meetings with diplomats and had not been admitted to the Russian Parliament.  Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor in chief of Russia in Global Affairs, said that Mr. Schockenhoff's criticisms would not have aroused such passions even a year ago. But they have come at a moment when Russia is striving to uproot the last vestiges of the 1990s, when Western governments stepped in to serve as guides in Russia's effort to build a post-Soviet state. ""President Putin's relationship with Chancellor Merkel has never been warm, but this time the atmosphere could be described as a political ice age,"" Mr. Lukyanov wrote in a column on Thursday. Mr. Putin took pains to discredit that idea on Friday, despite clear strains between the two leaders.  ""We have differences of opinion; it is true that we argue, seek compromise, but this is by no means a gloomy atmosphere,"" he said. He also paid Ms. Merkel a lavish compliment, saying, ""As to there being no German who could serve as a perfect model for us, there is one: Mrs. Federal Chancellor.""

2362,433681123.xml,"      Dozens of world leaders are to gather at the United Nations on Monday for a full agenda of talks on how to fight global warming, and President Bush is skipping all the day's events but the dinner. His focus instead is on his own gathering of leaders in Washington later this  week, a meeting with the same stated goal, a reduction in the emissions blamed for climate change, but a fundamentally different idea of how to achieve it.   Mr. Bush's aides say that the parallel meeting does not compete against the United Nations' process -- hijacking it, as his critics charge. They say that Mr. Bush hopes to persuade the nations that produce 90 percent of the world's emissions to come to a consensus that would allow each, including the United States, to set its own policies  rather than having limits imposed by binding international treaty. ''It's our philosophy that each nation has the sovereign capacity to decide for itself what its own portfolio of policies should be,'' said James L. Connaughton, the president's chief environmental adviser. Mr. Bush's approach sets the stage for a new round of diplomatic confrontation. And it raises the prospect that he could once again put the United States in the position of objecting to any binding international agreement intended to slow or reverse the emissions linked to rising temperatures. Whether Mr. Bush prevails remains to be seen, but the effort is the last chance in his presidency to shape the debate after years of being excoriated for keeping the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that limits the emissions of greenhouse gases from most industrialized countries. ''The leadership role of the United States is absolutely essential,'' said Timothy E. Wirth, a former senator and an environmental official in the Clinton administration, who is now president of the United Nations Foundation. ''Unless the United States decides that it wants to be a major and committed leadership player in this and make very specific commitments, much of the rest of the world is effectively going to hide behind the skirts of the United States and not do anything.'' The growing scientific consensus that humans contribute to rising temperatures and sea levels  -- reflected in melting glaciers, shrinking Arctic ice and the concerns raised by former Vice President Al Gore -- has pushed the issue to the top of a crowded diplomatic agenda at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly this week. So has the expiration in 2012 of the binding  restrictions under the Kyoto Protocol, which was intended to reduce participating  countries' emissions of greenhouse gases below the levels recorded in 1990. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, scheduled Monday's forum -- diplomatically speaking, a ''high-level event'' -- to jump-start talks on how to replace Kyoto, saying an agreement needed to be reached by 2009 to avoid ''any vacuum'' after its restrictions lapse. Negotiators are to begin those talks in December in Bali, Indonesia. ''Climate change is a challenge to our leadership, skills and vision,'' Mr. Ban said at the United Nations Headquarters last week, ''and we have to address that challenge boldly.'' About 80 heads of state or government are expected at the meeting, and 154 leaders and officials have signed up to speak. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will represent the United States, though Mr. Bush will attend a closed-door dinner on Monday night. Michael Kozak, a National Security Council official, called the event a ''working-dinner format.'' Mr. Bush's meeting in Washington this  week, to be held over two days, involves  15 countries, or major economies as the White House calls them, as well as the United Nations and the European Union. The 15 countries are the major emitters of greenhouse gases. They include the members of the group of  industrialized nations, as well as other large countries  with developing economies, like Indonesia, Brazil, China and India. Developing countries did not face emissions limits under Kyoto, which was one of the major reasons the United States ultimately opposed it. China, like the United States, has also gone on record as opposing mandatory caps in the future. Mr. Bush, long skeptical of reports of human-driven climate  change, proposed for the first time this year negotiating a ''long-term global goal'' for cutting emissions, while persuading  countries to agree to  invest more in research on alternative energy sources  and lower trade tariffs for products that reduce emissions. While opposing a binding cap on emissions, either domestically or globally, he has supported some mandatory measures, including increases in renewable fuels like ethanol and higher fuel-efficiency standards, efforts his administration once resisted. Briefing reporters before  the week's meetings, senior aides emphasized that each nation should decide for itself how to reduce emissions. ''The president's central proposition is really this: Tackling global climate change requires all major economies developed and developing to work together,'' said Dan Price, a deputy national security adviser. ''And it requires each to make a contribution consistent with its national circumstances.'' Critics argue that the administration's approach is not aggressive enough because it remains essentially voluntary. ''There's no serious environmental problem that's ever been solved by voluntary measures,'' said David Doniger, climate policy director at the National Resources Defense Council. He cited the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement that required countries to ban substances blamed for depleting the earth's ozone layer. That protocol was amended  Friday, with American support, to speed up the phasing out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons used in home appliances, refrigeration equipment and air conditioners. European leaders, including allies like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, have also supported setting mandatory caps on emissions. At the Group of 8 meeting this summer, Mrs. Merkel pushed for a 50 percent reduction by 2050 but had to settle for compromise language after President Bush made it clear the United States would not agree to it. Mr. Bush's aides are sensitive to the accusation that the White House has ignored climate change. They said that the administration's embrace of voluntary measures and some mandatory steps, like requiring renewable fuels to be mixed with gasoline, was having effects that would be lasting. Kevin Fay, executive director of the International Climate Change Partnership, a business group that supports some actions to limit emissions, said there was cautious support for Mr. Bush's talks, though it was tempered by the administration's previous record. ''It will take an awful lot,'' Mr. Fay said, ''to overcome the skepticism that has accumulated over the last six years.''

3507,2061264172.xml,"BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders, after marathon talks overnight, announced early Friday that they had reached a compromise deal on the issue of migration, which has created a political crisis that threatens to undermine the bloc.As Italy's new populist government threatened to block all progress, European leaders thrashed out the topic for nine hours, finally reaching an agreement around 5 a.m. While details were sketchy, the leaders agreed in principle, at least, on how to shore up their external borders and create screening centers for migrants, to decide more quickly whether or not they are legitimate refugees.""We still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said after the discussions, which a senior European official described as sometimes virulent.The leaders agreed to establish voluntary screening centers on European soil, to ease the burden on countries like Italy, Spain and Greece where migrants first arrive and are registered. They also agreed to study setting up similar centers outside Europe, in North Africa, for example, to screen migrants before they arrive.Ms. Merkel had even more at stake than the Italians, under pressure from within her own government to solve the problem of migrants coming into Germany after having registered in other countries. The Italian concern has been to stop migrants from coming to Europe in the first place.Inside Europe, the proposed centers would house migrants until they are screened, with the idea of deciding their fate more efficiently and sending back those who do not qualify as refugees. But no country has so far volunteered to host such a center.Outside Europe, centers would be designed to reduce the number of migrants who risk the sea voyage to the Continent and to disrupt the black economy of people-smuggling. Those rescued at sea could be returned to those centers for screening, not brought to Europe. But again, it was not clear which African countries might agree to house such platforms, or whether they would be compatible with international law.Addressing the concerns in Germany about registered migrants moving within Europe to try to settle there, the European leaders simply promised to ""take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures to counter such movements."" The intent is to prevent the setting up of internal borders within the Schengen free-travel area, which could destroy the principle of borderless movement of people and goods.Whether that would be enough to satisfy Ms. Merkel's critics at home remained to be seen.France was instrumental in trying to broker the agreement with Italy, which said it would block all agreements reached at this summit meeting until its concerns about migration were addressed. Early Friday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that ""today Italy is no longer alone. We are satisfied.""One potential hurdle for the deal is the fact that the European Union has no uniform rules or procedures for asylum, making it unclear what rules would be applied in a screening center, whether inside or outside Europe. But setting up any such center would be a significant change from the current system, under which migrants must be screened in the European country where they first arrive and are registered.Before arriving in Brussels, Ms. Merkel warned that the issue of migration could make or break the European Union, delivering a passionate address to her Parliament.""Europe faces many challenges,"" said Ms. Merkel. ""But that of migration could become one that determines the fate of the European Union.""The summit meeting was originally supposed to focus on changes to solidify the euro and on Britain's exit from the bloc. It swerved instead to migration, which has become politically fraught with the rise of populist, anti-immigrant parties -- even as the number of migrants coming to Europe has fallen sharply.The new Italian government played hardball on Thursday, with Mr. Conte refusing to agree to joint conclusions on issues like digital innovation or defense cooperation until migration was dealt with.Italy has insisted on changing the regulations that govern migration into the European Union, saying that as a country of first landing, it has had enough. Italy has started to turn away ships that rescue migrants from the sea.At the same time, Ms. Merkel faces an internal rebellion by Bavarian conservatives over immigration that threatens to bring down her government. Her Bavarian interior minister has warned that he will disobey her and establish a hard border with Austria unless she strikes a deal with European leaders to stem the flow of migrants into Germany.That standoff reflects the fraught politics of migration, with Bavarian conservatives facing a strong challenge from the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany in state elections in October.So Ms. Merkel came to Brussels to reach the kind of accord on limiting migration that has slipped the grasp of European Union leaders for years.If she failed to reach an agreement that would allow her to turn back certain groups of migrants at the German border, the Bavarians could quit her government, a move that would most likely put her out of a job after almost 13 years as German leader and usher in months of uncertainty in the European Union's most influential country.In front of a rowdy Parliament on Thursday, she essentially conflated her own fate with that of the union. Either Europe masters this challenge of migration, she said, and proves to other countries that ""we are guided by values and that we rely on multilateralism, and not unilateralism,"" or ""no one will believe any more in our value system that made us so strong.""The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said before the summit meeting that the leaders should ""focus on the E.U.'s external borders,"" including screening centers, since the flow of migrants had slowed. Since 2015, Mr. Tusk said, ""we have managed to stem the migration flow by 96 percent only because we decided to cooperate with third countries and to block illegal migration outside the E.U.""The alternative, he said, ""would be a chaotically advancing closure of borders -- also within the E.U. -- as well as growing conflict among E.U. member states.""But given the tough stance on migration being taken by countries like Italy, Austria and Hungary, Mr. Tusk suggested, Europe needed to act. ""Some may think I am too tough in my proposals on migration, but trust me,"" he said. ""If we don't agree on them then you will see some really tough proposals from some really tough guys.""Ms. Merkel agreed, rejecting the idea of unilaterally turning back migrants at the border. Such a move would have ripple effects far beyond Germany, she warned, endangering the European project of border-free travel.Ms. Merkel's pro-European stance and her decision to open Germany's borders to more than 1.4 million migrants since 2015 have earned her a reputation as a defender of liberal values, while also making her the main target of far-right and populist forces across the Continent.Her address in Parliament on Thursday was unusually combative, and it was frequently interrupted by heckling from representatives of Alternative for Germany. The noise level was so high at one point that Ms. Merkel stopped and said: ""My God. Really?""In Brussels, the Hungarian prime minister, Victor Orban, was characteristically harsh.""I think the people really request two things: First is, no more migrants in,"" he said. The second, he said, would be the deportation of those who are already in Europe but do not qualify as refugees.""So that's what the people want,"" Mr. Orban said. ""So I think in order to restore the European democracy, we have to move to that direction.""But there were words of support for Ms. Merkel from other leaders, including those of Spain and Luxembourg, whose prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said: ""If we have countries saying this and that is a red line, we will never get an agreement. Legal immigration has to be the rule.""""There are so many people who arrived in different countries and then made their way to Germany,"" Mr. Bettel continued. ""I understand Germany says, 'Why do we have to deal with everything?""'Charles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, said that the discussion was a ""very important moment"" for Europe.""Do we or do we not want to protect the Schengen zone by finding solutions together in a European context to manage the refugees and migrants?"" he asked, referring to the system that allows passport-free travel through much of Europe.Credit: STEVEN ERLANGER and KATRIN BENNHOLD; Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Katrin Bennhold from Berlin.

979,912406403.xml,"      This week, the European Central Bank, under the energized leadership of Mario Draghi, took the desperately needed step of injecting hundreds of billions of euros into the Continent's tottering banking system.    It is a short-term solution and not even the best possible use of the central bank's resources, which should be used to buy government bonds from distressed economies like Italy and Spain to keep their interest costs manageable. But with confidence in Europe's financial system evaporating and European Union leaders locked in an irrelevant discussion of how to assure long-term fiscal virtue, the central bank has saved the day -- for now.    It offered all banks operating in the euro zone three-year loans at its very low interest rate (currently 1 percent). More than 500 banks took up the offer, borrowing a total of $640 billion, far more than expected.    Though a large chunk of that borrowing will be used to replace existing loans, as much as $353 billion in new money will likely be used by the banks in three ways -- to strengthen their own finances, ease credit to businesses and consumers and buy euro-zone government bonds. All three uses should help relieve some of the dangerous pressures building in the European financial system in recent weeks.    European banks had been finding it increasingly difficult to finance their operations from private markets. Italy and Spain cannot go on paying unsustainable interest rates on their bonds. And a credit crunch for businesses on top of misguided government austerity programs would have pushed Europe into an even deeper and longer recession than it already faces.    As timely and welcome as it is, the central bank's loan program only addresses the symptoms of plunging liquidity and not the underlying issue of diverging competitiveness between efficient exporters like Germany and underperforming countries like Greece and Italy.    The solution to that central issue is not stiff doses of austerity for all. Stronger economies, like Germany, need stimulus so they can buy more, not less, from their euro-zone partners. And ailing economies, like Greece, Italy and Spain, need to boost their competitiveness and growth by labor market reform, freer market competition, fairer tax systems and more efficient government. Those changes will revitalize them faster than the growth-killing tax increases and service cuts favored by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.    Thanks to Mr. Draghi, Europe's financial system is now likely to make it safely through the next few weeks or months. More constructive help from Mrs. Merkel will be required to make it safely through 2012.      ",2011-12-23
4219,2394479586.xml,"'R-naught' represents the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case. You may be hearing a lot about this.World leaders and public health experts are poised to spend the coming months or years obsessed with a variable known as R0.Pronounced ""R-naught,"" it represents the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case.In other words, if R0 is 2.5, then one person with the disease is expected to infect, on average, 2.5 others.An R0 below 1 suggests that the number of cases is shrinking, possibly allowing societies to open back up. An R0 above 1 indicates that the number of cases is growing, perhaps necessitating renewed lockdowns or other measures.But R0 is messier than it might look. It is built on hard science, forensic investigation, complex mathematical models -- and often a good deal of guesswork. It can vary radically from place to place and day to day, pushed up or down by local conditions and human behavior.Yet for all its vagaries, R0 is expected to shape our world in the coming months and possibly years as governments and health experts treat it as the closest thing to a compass in navigating the pandemic.What follows is a simple guide to how this metric works, why it matters and how to think about it.What is R0?The term is borrowed from the study of demographics, where it is used to describe birthrates.R refers to reproduction and 0 to the zeroth generation, as in patient zero. Together, they are typically called the basic reproduction number.It is calculated from innate features of a disease, like how easily it jumps from one person to the next, along with elements of human behavior that shape how often sick and susceptible people will come into contact.The resulting number is meant to help model an outbreak's possible trajectory.Say that 1,000 people have a seasonal flu whose R0 is estimated at 1.3.They would be expected to infect 1,300 people. That second generation would go on to infect another 1,690.That can add up. By the 10th generation, about 30 days time, 42,621 people would have caught the flu.But any R0 is just an estimate and, epidemiologists stress, an imperfect one.A paper published last year in Emerging Infectious Diseases, an academic journal, described the metric as important but warned that it can be ""easily misrepresented, misinterpreted and misapplied.""There is no consensus for how to measure it. Much of the underlying math relies, by necessity, on educated guesses and on human factors that can change unpredictably.For this reason, most diseases are given a range, rather than a single figure. SARS is usually described as having an R0 of 2 to 5 -- an enormous difference.Tellingly, scientists are still disputing and revising estimates for diseases that have been studied for years; R0 figures for measles have ranged from 3.7 to 203.Still, for all its flaws, it's  useful shorthand for both experts studying the disease and leaders trying to manage it.What is the R0 for the coronavirus?In practice, there is no such thing as a fixed R0. It's better to think of this number as a starting point for the virus's behavior in the absence of real-world human or environmental factors.New figures are coming out all the time. But, generally, studies now estimate that the pathogen that causes Covid-19 has an R0 of 2 to 2.5.That's significantly higher than the flu and within lower-end ranges for SARS, another coronavirus.To know how quickly a virus spreads, you also need its serial interval, or average time between each successive infection. Some studies estimate the coronavirus's at 4 to 4.5 days. That's almost twice as fast as SARS, which is why the coronavirus spreads so much more quickly.The serial interval, though, is considered more or less fixed. People can heavily influence R0, which is why it receives so much more attention than other metrics.The term can also be used to describe a snapshot in time: an estimate of how the virus is reproducing on the ground in a given time and place.For example, during China's initial outbreak, one study estimated, the virus spread with an R0 of 5.7 -- a catastrophically high figure.Why is R0 such a big deal?Governments increasingly use R0 as a metric for whether their country's cases are growing faster than they can manage or shrinking as quickly as they'd like.Interest in R0 has grown so intense that a video of Angela Merkel, the restrained German chancellor rarely associated with viral videos, explaining the variable has been viewed nearly nine million times.""We are now at about a reproduction factor of 1, so one person is infecting another one,"" Ms. Merkel said at a press event last week. ""If we get to the point where everybody infects 1.1 people, then by October we will reach the capacity of our health care system.""When a country has more patients than intensive care beds, death rates can spike drastically.At an R0 of 1.2, Ms. Merkel went on, Germany would cross that threshold in July. At an R0 of 1.3, it would happen in June.""So that's where you see how small the margin is,"" she said.But real-time R0 estimates like Germany's are, however sophisticated, highly speculative. It is an estimate built on other estimates, some more informed than others.Still, it is one of our only metrics for guessing at how well lockdowns and other policies are working -- and therefore for determining whether and when those policies are worth their enormous economic and social costs.Does an R0 below 1 mean the virus is defeated?No. It means, assuming the numbers are correct, that the virus's spread has been paused.Where R0 drops below 1, this means that every, say, 100 sick people will infect fewer than 100 others. Each successive generation of infections will be smaller than the last.But people can still get sick, and people can still die. It can take a long time for countries to see the virus fully recede, especially if the initial outbreak was bad.Italy, for example, recently estimated that its social and economic restrictions had pushed the virus's R0 down to 0.8 -- a huge achievement won at a heavy cost.How long might it take Italy to resemble South Korea, which is tentatively reopening as it confirms about 10 new cases per day?Italy reported 15,918 new cases in the past five days, a workable shorthand for the number of people who might still be infectious. At an R0 of 0.8, it would take 26.8 generations of the virus for Italy's new infections to pace South Korea's.At four days per generation, that's about 100 days, or early August. And that's only if the status quo -- lockdown -- is maintained.Three and a half more months of social restrictions would be costly for Italy's already-strained society and economy. And it would not be a guarantee. Even South Korea has measures in place to reimpose lockdowns if cases resurge.This is why some experts believe that, in the coming months or years, government measures will not be aimed at simply driving down R0 as low as possible, but at managing it within acceptable levels.In such a scheme, social and economic restrictions would be lifted and reimposed in response to fluctuations in the R0. But no one knows what the right balance would be, much less how to achieve it.A Harvard University study estimated that keeping new cases within what the health care system can manage could require calibrating off-and-on lockdowns through mid-2022.How are governments managing R0?Official efforts to track R0 are spotty but growing more common.Several European countries now report estimates below 1, but levels of success remain uncertain.Germany puts its own at 0.9, up from a recent low of 0.7, which had led Ms. Merkel to ease restrictions. Governments face gut-wrenching dilemmas over whether to accept such upticks as necessary evils.One study from France estimated that timely lockdowns pushed R0 down to 0.5 from 3.3, a stunning transformation.Still, French cases jumped the day after the study was published, in part because nursing home infections had not previously been recorded, a reminder that R0 estimates are imperfect shorthand.India, whose enormous population and rickety health care system make it one of the pandemic's most-watched countries, estimates its R0 to have declined to 1.36 from 1.55. That's low, but still above 1 -- meaning case numbers are growing.It is difficult to assign the United States a single R0 figure. The country has multiple concurrent outbreaks, each with its own dynamics and each at a different point in its life cycle.The former founders of Instagram set up a website that estimates state-by-state Rt values, a variation on R0 that accounts for rates of transmission. Though it is not associated with professional epidemiologists or public health experts, it has received heavy attention, reflecting the hunger for information on this useful but fuzzy metric.A New Delhi neighborhood in lockdown. In India, government officials say the R0 factor is dropping but still higher than 1. (PHOTOGRAPH BY REBECCA CONWAY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)",2020-04-25
2027,1777803677.xml,"       KANDALAKSHA, Russia --  So many decrepit Soviet-era cars carried migrants into Europe from this frozen Russian town in recent months that border officials in Finland, who confiscate the rust-bucket vehicles as soon as they cross the frontier, watched in dismay as their parking lot turned into a scrapyard. To clear up the mess and provide some space for freshly confiscated cars, the Finnish customs service set up a separate dumping ground. Then last month, as suddenly and as mysteriously as it had started, the parade of migrants in rusty old cars came to an abrupt halt, or at least a pause. ""We don't know what is going on,"" said Matti Daavittila, the head of the ice-entombed Finnish border post near Salla. ""They suddenly stopped coming. That is all we know."" Compared with the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war or hardship who made the trek to Europe last year through Turkey to Greece, the flow of refugees and migrants on the Arctic route through Russia -- first into Norway and later into Finland -- is tiny. But the stop-go traffic has added a hefty dose of geopolitical anxiety, not to mention intrigue, to a crisis that is tearing the European Union apart. It has sent alarm bells ringing in Helsinki, Finland's capital far to the south, and in Brussels, where European Union leaders, at recent crisis meetings on migration, discussed the strange and ever-shifting Arctic route through Russia. The intrigue flows from a growing suspicion in the West that Russia is stoking and exploiting Europe's migrant crisis to extract concessions, or perhaps crack the European unity over economic sanctions imposed against Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. Only one of the European Union's 28 member states needs to break ranks for a regime of credit and other restrictions to collapse. ""Unfortunately, this looks like a political demonstration by Russia,"" said Ilkka Kanerva, Finland's former foreign minister and now the chairman of its parliamentary Defense Committee. ""They are very skillful at sending signals. They want to show that Finland should be very careful when it makes its own decisions on things like military exercises, our partnership with NATO and European Union sanctions"" against Russia. Unlike the flow of refugees and migrants into Greece by boat, in which the tempo is largely set by the weather in the Aegean Sea, the flow through Russia is almost entirely dependent on whether Russia's Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the K.G.B., opens or closes roads in a heavily militarized border region crammed with bases. In the first two months of this year, nearly 800 asylum seekers crossed from Russia into Finland near Salla, a crossing point west of Kandalaksha in the Finnish region of Lapland, compared with none in same period last year. Sayid Mussa Khan, a 31-year-old Afghan who had worked for an American security company in Kabul, made it to Finland on Feb. 28, just a day before the traffic suddenly halted after a statement by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to security service chiefs that Russia should ""tighten monitoring of refugee flows."" Along with his family and around a dozen other asylum seekers, Mr. Khan set out at dawn from Kandalaksha in a convoy of old cars and, accompanied by Russian guides, breezed through three checkpoints to reach the Finnish border. Mr. Khan, who sat with his wife and baby son in the back seat of a wheezing Lada, said he had never even heard of Finland when he left Kabul in 2014 and, after two years in Russia and Belarus, still was not really sure where it was he was going. But he knew he wanted to get his family to Europe, and had been assured that he would get there once he had paid $6,000 to a facilitator in Moscow, who immediately arranged for the family to be issued with a deportation order by the Russian authorities. ""He asked me where I wanted to go and said: 'No problem. We will get you to Finland. Everybody is going there now,' "" said Mr. Khan, who is now in Finland waiting for the authorities to review his asylum application. Jorma Vuorio, the director general of Finland's Migration Department, said he had been surprised by the ""completely new phenomenon"" of asylum seekers arriving from Russia. But he added that there ""was no proof, just speculation,"" of involvement by the Russian state. The traffic into Europe through the Arctic, which has involved relatively few Syrians, began late last summer, with more than 5,000 migrants on bicycles suddenly pouring across Russia's previously tightly controlled northern border into Norway. But that cycle-borne flow ended abruptly on Nov. 30, after the Russian authorities reintroduced tight controls just as Norwegian officials arrived in Moscow for talks on how to stem the flow. The migrants' route then shifted southward to Russia's border with Finland, as Russian guards on roads to two Finnish border crossings stopped blocking travelers without visas. Finland swiftly banned cycle traffic across its 830-mile border with Russia, allowing only people in cars to cross. This killed a booming market for old bicycles in Russia's far north but created a new market for cheap and decrepit Russian cars with just enough life left in them to limp across the border to Finland. Mr. Vuorio said his Russian counterpart had informed him that Russia had more than 11 million foreigners living in its territory, a vast pool of potential migrants to Europe, but added that he doubted Moscow would allow a chaotic flood through sensitive border regions. Criminal gangs, not officials, he added, seem to be largely responsible for managing the scale and direction of migration to Europe through Russia. He said the last halt in the traffic was not the result of any deal struck by Finnish and Russian officials, who have been engaged in weeks of intensive, high-level discussions. ""Our only deal is that we have good relations,"" he said, bewildered by the stop-go flow. But that, said the Defense Committee chairman, Mr. Kanerva, is precisely Russia's aim -- to keep Finland off balance and thus wary of making any move toward NATO or making other decisions that would anger Moscow. Noting that Russia had shown itself adept in Ukraine at so-called hybrid warfare, the use of nonmilitary tools to pursue its goals, he said migrants ""are part of a broader strategy."" ""They want to make us nervous and pay attention to their interests,"" he added. Like the conflict in Syria, Europe's migrant crisis has given Moscow an opportunity to assert itself as an indispensable power that Europe cannot afford to ignore, much less antagonize. When Finland's president visited Moscow last month, Mr. Putin scolded him over the damage to both Russia and Finland caused by sanctions. The two leaders agreed to bar all but their own citizens and citizens of Belarus at two Arctic border crossings for six months. While Russian officials have strenuously denied steering migrants toward Europe, the Kremlin has taken thinly disguised delight in Europe's troubles, particularly those of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has dominated European policy toward Russia on sanctions and other matters. State-controlled Russian television has served up a daily diet of migrant-related horror stories, including a false report that migrants had raped a 13-year-old Russian-German girl in Berlin. Mr. Putin, meanwhile, recently hosted visits to Moscow by two of Ms. Merkel's most vocal critics, President Viktor Orban of Hungary and Premier Horst Seehofer of the German state of Bavaria. Russia's military actions in Syria, where the bombing of rebel targets often prompts the flight of civilians nearby, has further added to suspicions, especially in the United States, that Moscow wants to stoke Europe's migration crisis for political ends. Speaking to the Senate Armed Services Committee recently in Washington, NATO's American commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, accused Russia of ""deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve."" A spokesman for Russia's Defense Ministry, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, dismissed General Breedlove's allegations as absurd, noting that Europe's refugee crisis began long before Moscow started its military action in Syria on Sept. 30.  The one group that needs no convincing about Russia's manipulation of the migrant issue is the migrants themselves. In interviews in Kandalaksha, stranded migrants from West and Central Africa said they had each paid thousands of dollars to ""guides"" who promised to get them to Finland and who worked closely with Russian officials. The system was highly organized, the migrants said, with no more than 30 people allowed to make the journey to Finland each day. Who went when, and in which vehicle, was established in advance, they said, with the guides and officials drawing up detailed lists with names, departure dates and cars. ""They are all in the same clique: the officials, the hotel people, the drivers. This is their business,"" said Honoré Basubte, a young migrant from West Africa who had come to Russia as a student. Like many of the other migrants who traveled to Kandalaksha, he said he had been issued a Russian deportation order before setting out and been told to leave quickly for Europe. ""Now they say we can't go because the border is closed,"" he said. ""This is all an ugly game."" Migrants From African Counties in a Hostel in Kandalaksha, Waiting to Cross Into Finland.

2535,1847613048.xml,"       MANUS, Papua New Guinea -- The plane banks over the dense tropical forest of Manus Island, little touched, it seems, by human hand. South Pacific waters lap onto deserted beaches. The jungle glistens, impenetrable. At the unfenced airport, built by occupying Japanese forces during World War II, a sign ""welcomes you to our very beautiful island paradise in the sun."" It could be that, a 60-mile-long slice of heaven. But for more than 900 asylum seekers from across the world banished by Australia to this remote corner of the Papua New Guinea archipelago, Manus has been hell; a three and a half year exercise in mental and physical cruelty conducted in near secrecy beneath the green canopy of the tropics. A road, newly paved by Australia as part payment to its former colony for hosting this punitive experiment in refugee management, leads to Lorengau, a capital of romantic name and unromantic misery. Here I find Benham Satah, a Kurd who fled persecution in the western Iranian city of Kermanshah. Detained on Australia's Christmas Island after crossing in a smuggler's boat from Indonesia and later forced onto a Manus-bound plane, he has languished here since Aug. 27, 2013. Endless limbo undoes the mind. But going home could mean facing death: Refugees do not flee out of choice but because they have no choice. Satah's light brown eyes are glassy. His legs tremble. A young man with a college degree in English, he is now nameless, a mere registration number -- FRT009 -- to Australian officials. ""Sometimes I cut myself,"" he says, ""so that I can see my blood and remember, 'Oh, yes! I am alive.' "" Reza Barati, his former roommate at what the men's ID badges call the Offshore Processing Center (Orwell would be proud), is dead. A fellow Iranian Kurd, he was killed, aged 23, on Feb. 17, 2014. Satah witnessed the tall, quiet volleyball player being beaten to death after a local mob scaled the wall of the facility. Protests by asylum seekers had led to rising tensions with the Australian authorities and their Manus enforcers. The murder obsesses Satah but constitutes a mere fraction of the human cost of a policy that, since July 19, 2013, has sent more than 2,000 asylum seekers and refugees to Manus and the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru, far from inquiring eyes. (Unable to obtain a press visa to visit Manus, I went nonetheless.) The toll among Burmese, Sudanese, Somali, Lebanese, Pakistani, Iraqi, Afghan, Syrian, Iranian and other migrants is devastating: self-immolation, overdoses, death from septicemia as a result of medical negligence, sexual abuse and rampant despair. A recent United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report by three medical experts found that 88 percent of the 181 asylum seekers and refugees examined on Manus were suffering from depressive disorders, including, in some cases, psychosis. The world's refugee crisis, with its 65 million people on the move, more than at any time since 1945, knows no more sustained, sinister or surreal exercise in cruelty than the South Pacific quasi-prisons Australia has established for its trickle of the migrant flood. Australia, like Europe but on a much smaller scale, faces a genuine dilemma: What to do about desperate migrants trying by any means to gain asylum? Their journeys across the world have fueled rightist movements in many developed societies. Anxiety, whether related to jobs or terrorism, is high and, as Donald Trump demonstrated, scapegoating is effective. Approaches to the crisis have varied. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has taken in more than a million. But the Australian government argues that toughness is the only way to prevent the country from being overwhelmed. It has ""stopped the boats"" and the Indonesian smugglers behind them: This is the essence of Australia's case. The government says it has prevented deaths like those in the Mediterranean, where more than 4,000 migrants have drowned this year. By turning back the ""queue jumpers,"" a phrase that resonates in a nation devoted to a ""fair go"" for all, it has safeguarded Australia's right to select who gets to people a vast and empty country. The official vow that those marooned on Manus and Nauru will never live in Australia has assumed doctrinal vehemence. In Peter Dutton, the immigration minister, the country has its own little Trump. Last May he portrayed the asylum seekers as illiterates bent on stealing Australian jobs, and he has suggested ""mistakes"" were made in letting in too many Lebanese Muslim immigrants. His soft bigotry resonates with enough voters to sway elections. At the same time, Manus and Nauru are a growing embarrassment to Australia, a party to all major human rights treaties. ""There is an increasing realization that this is unsustainable,"" Madeline Gleeson, an Australian human rights lawyer, told me. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull knows this and needs a way out. After Omid Masoumali, a young Iranian, burned himself to death on Nauru this year, a cartoon by Cathy Wilcox captured Australia's shame. Above a man in flames was the caption ""Not drowning."" The result is a one-time agreement with the United States, announced last month. America will, over an unspecified period, take in an unspecified number of the refugees, with priority going to the women, children and families who are on Nauru. The single men on Manus would presumably bring up the rear, if accepted at all with Trump in office. Turnbull has said he's confident Trump will not torpedo the deal. But when I asked Benham Satah if he thought he would soon be in the United States, he drew on a cigarette and gazed out to sea: ""After three years suffering here I know only this: Unless you see it, don't believe it."" In the early morning at the Lorengau covered market, another Australian-funded project, women lay out produce and wares. Pickings are slim: pineapples, papaya and small bunches of peanuts. Giant turtles with prices scrawled on their bellies flap in expiration as the sun rises and flies hover. Betel nut has pride of place on many tables. Chewing the nut is a Manus habit often manifested in scarlet lips and rotting teeth. Betel, a mild stimulant, prompts what June Polomon, who works in the market, called ""our tendency to be nonstop chatterers, just like our noisy friarbirds."" Visiting Manus in 1928, Margaret Mead, the American anthropologist, described a scene little changed nine decades later: ""He puts a betel nut in his mouth, leisurely rolls a pepper leaf into a long funnel, bites off the end, and dipping the spatula into the powdered lime, adds a bit of lime to the mixture he is already chewing vigorously."" As they chew, the people of Manus discuss property (familial attachment to land is fierce), daughters' dowries and the many hundreds of asylum seekers who -- unexpected and unexplained -- were deposited in 2013 at the island's Lombrum naval base, originally established by United States forces in 1944 under Gen. Douglas MacArthur. ""If Australia had cared, it would have told us something, talked to our village leaders, who are important,"" Polomon told me. ""We've been used in a neocolonial way."" That is also the view of Charlie Benjamin, the Manus governor, whom I found in indignant mood. ""It's just morally wrong to dump these people here and then say, 'Never Australia,' "" he said. ""Our understanding was we'd help a process and genuine refugees would move on, but no process exists."" He described endless wrangling with the Australian authorities over roads he believes they should pay for -- the western half of the island is still so inaccessible the governor said it took him six hours to drive the 50 miles to his village. Under the money-for-migrants deal between Canberra and the Papua New Guinea government in Port Moresby, Australia promised its former colony hundreds of millions of dollars, but chiefly for projects outside Manus. The 60,000 inhabitants of Manus were never consulted. Nor, of course, were the asylum seekers and refugees. When they arrived, they had no idea where they were. Seeing black Papuans, many thought they were in Africa. For almost three years they were held in the detention camp, humiliated and intermittently terrorized. Last April, the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ordered an end to ""the unconstitutional and illegal detention of the asylum seekers or transferees at the relocation center on Manus""; it was an offense ""against their rights and freedoms."" To which Dutton, the immigration minister, promptly responded that nobody in Manus ""will settle in Australia."" The only change resulting from the ruling is that refugees can now leave the camp during the day and take buses into Lorengau. ""We're just in a bigger prison,"" Abdirahman Ahmed, a Somali refugee, told me. The Shabab jihadi militia killed his father and brother in Mogadishu. ""Sometimes I think maybe if I die it's better. If you die there's no question in front of you, no interpreter between you and God, no immigration, no Australia. We are not human, just a signpost: If you want to come to Australia you will end up in Manus with three years of trauma and torture."" They are the walking dead, suspended in a dreamland, staring out at shimmering islets. Abdul Aziz Muhamat's lips are trembling. He is from Darfur and recalls how Sudanese government forces bound a villager's limbs to four horses ""and they tore him up."" The soldiers put children in a fuel-doused hut and torched it. ""I can see it like yesterday,"" he says. With an uncle's help Aziz -- the name he now uses -- fled: Khartoum airport, Yemenia Airways Flight 632 (""I still remember the number"") to Sana, on to Dubai, and from there to Jakarta. He is met by a Sudanese man who whisks him south to Bogor, where he hides in a house with Iranians, Pakistanis, Burmese and others. It is mid-August 2013. They move on by truck at night, then paddle in canoes to an island, and board a rickety boat crammed with 50 people. ""I asked where we were going,"" Aziz tells me, ""and this guy said Australia."" But after 12 hours at sea, with the boat foundering, they turn back. Five people drown. When Aziz tries again in October, his boat is intercepted by the Australian Navy and he is thrown into a detention center on Christmas Island with more than 40 others. Finally an Australian immigration officer tells them they will be flown to Manus, ""a very dangerous place full of contagious diseases -- if you touch a local, sanitize yourself."" ""I have a question,"" Aziz says. ""That's it. I cannot answer questions,"" says the immigration officer. ""If you know these things exist on Manus Island, why do you want to send us there?"" Aziz says he's in a cage. The whole island is a cage. Then he says he's in a hole. He has no feelings, no desire. There's no point asking why. It's been too long. At first conditions in the detention center are primitive, hundreds of men crammed into makeshift compounds or tents, scant food, bullying expat staff contracted by Australia, constant threats from a special Papuan police riot squad flown in at Australian expense -- and no information, no ""process."" Nothing. Frustration boils up in early 2014. For weeks, there are peaceful protests every evening, chants of ""Freedom."" But they have no effect, and the asylum seekers are told that ""processing"" could take a decade: Kafka in the tropics. Anger turns to rage. Two Iranians try to escape and are beaten up. Local thugs with machetes and bush knives, drunk on moonshine, goaded and abetted by some international security staff, pile into the camp. Shots are fired. Reza Barati is killed. Aziz, his toe broken, finds himself in the clinic among ""170 guys lying on concrete, some conscious, some unconscious, bodies full of blood. I thought I was back in Darfur."" Dump men in the middle of nowhere, confine them, abuse them, suspend them in limbo, and this is what you get. The riot changes nothing. A year later, in January 2015, hundreds of men begin a hunger strike. Several sew their mouths shut. The strike persists for two weeks. The authorities break it by throwing Aziz, Benham Satah and others into solitary confinement in windowless containers known as the ""chauka"" (named after a bird unique to Manus). The hunger strike changes nothing. Australia has relied on the remoteness and secrecy of its program: out of sight, out of mind. Keep the press out. Impose draconian nondisclosure clauses in contracts for everyone who works there. Even pass a federal law that can send whistle-blowers to prison. On the whole, it has worked. Still, the ugliness is beginning to seep out. In 41 months these stranded men have had only two pieces of good news: the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruling and now the Australian deal with the United States. ""The deal represents a long overdue concession from the government that it cannot leave people on Manus and Nauru forever,"" Daniel Webb, a lawyer at the Melbourne Human Rights Law Center, told me. ""That concession is way overdue, but it does not end their suffering."" Aziz, a smart young man who now has dreams of becoming a human rights lawyer, said the policy is ""not about stopping boats. I think it's about using innocent people as political tools to win elections."" Moving the asylum seekers elsewhere to be processed was not in itself unlawful, so long as the process was fair and efficient and met basic human rights standards. There should have been explanatory sessions with the local authorities, clarity over who was running facilities, zero detention and an Australian-led regional effort to secure a decent life for the refugees. None of this occurred. Instead, Australia, briefly under a Labor Party government and then under the conservatives, has effectively argued that the end (discouraging human smuggling) justifies the means (cruelty). As Hugh Mackay, a social researcher, observed, this is ""the very same principle used to justify torture."" And even so, boats are still being turned around by a huge naval deployment. A strange hysteria about the ""boat people"" seems to have blinded Australia to what is being perpetrated in its name. The country was founded on a similar principle to ""offshore processing"": Britain's dispatch in the late 18th century of convicts to a faraway land in Oceania, where they, too, would be invisible. Its subsequent history has included the slaughter and incarceration of the native Aboriginal people; the White Australia policy, under which a vast land mass was seen as threatened by black people and other nonwhites emanating from places like Papua New Guinea; the ""stolen generation"" policy, under which tens of thousands of Aboriginal children were taken from their families and placed in white homes; and now this disgraceful consignment of asylum seekers, many of them dark-skinned and Muslim, to faraway islands where they are left to fester with the ""natives."" ""Australians have a tendency to feel vulnerable,"" Amelia Lester, the editor of the magazine Good Weekend, told me. ""We're so far from anywhere, it breeds a kind of paranoia."" Just 24 million people live in Australia, a country twice the size of India, where 1.25 billion live. Might there be room to squeeze in 2,000 more? Australia has not known a recession in a quarter-century. Perhaps it is hard to imagine what humiliation and despair are. But it is time to imagine; they are right here, across the water. ""Whatever the policy challenge, deliberate cruelty to thousands of innocent people is never the solution,"" Webb told me. One measure of the government's obsession is that it has introduced legislation to impose a lifetime ban from Australia for anyone held at one of the camps. So in theory, a man from Manus could go to the United States under the recently announced deal, become a Harvard professor, and never be able to visit Sydney. Another is that it insists that the roughly 370 people moved from Manus or Nauru to Australia as ""transitory persons"" because they were injured in riots, or sexually assaulted, or were dying, or pregnant, or had broken down (like the wife of the Iranian who self-immolated) cannot stay in Australia. If they want to be considered for the American deal, they would have to return to one of the islands to be ""processed."" The ""transitory persons"" include about 40 children. This is madness. Lynne Elworthy, a mental health nurse, is one Australian who knows the agony of Manus and Nauru. She's worked on both islands, and spoke to me in brave defiance of the nondisclosure rules meant to gag her. ""Some cope better, focus on gym and seem to do O.K.,"" she said. ""But many men in Manus are withdrawn, skinny, depressed and worn out, hopeless, with plummeting lows. It's quite obvious to see this. They exist in a lifeless pit."" She continued: ""Apart from the way the whites treated the Aborigines when they first arrived -- that was worse -- this will come in second by the time Manus and Nauru are considered for their absolute cruelty. I imagine one day a royal commission will look into the illegal imprisonment, the damage caused, the agony and the injury."" On my last day in Manus I managed to get through the navy checkpoint at the entrance to the camp. Rain was falling heavily. I drove past General MacArthur's old house, and an American-built church, and down to the high metal fences and barbed wire. Dozens of Australian border guards were exercising in a field. Jeeps and white S.U.V.s splashed by. I saw the barracks -- Oscar and Delta and Mike and Foxtrot -- and by now it was easy to imagine the suffering endured within. Behrouz Boochani, another Iranian refugee, had broken down in front of me a couple of days earlier, crying uncontrollably. ""I can't sleep,"" he said. ""I want justice,"" he said. ""I have one million pages of incriminating documents,"" he said. Emaciated, with pale green eyes, a ponytail and beard, he was a broken but still determined man: ""We are here because of all Australia, all the people who are silent, who have done nothing."" Among the refugees is Nayser Ahmed, a Rohingya who fled persecution in Myanmar on July 2, 2013. Now 63, he made his way to Indonesia with his wife and six children. But when they boarded the bus to go to the boat, he was unable to squeeze in alongside. His family reached Australia before the imposition of the Manus and Nauru policy, and now live in Sydney. He did not. Every effort to be reunited with his family since he arrived in Manus on Nov. 15, 2013, has failed. Ahmed's nose and ribs were broken in the 2014 riot. A daughter got married in Sydney two years ago; he told her to stay well and not think too much. He blames himself for missing the bus. ""I think all the time about what happened,"" he told me. ""When I close my eyes, I can see that bus leaving."" He said he was ""shouting and screaming, 'My family is gone, someone help me!' "" What is incumbent on Australia now is clear enough. Prevail on Trump to take as many of the refugees as possible. Reunite Nayser Ahmed with his family. Recognize that the country has incurred a moral debt to the myriad people it has mistreated on the islands and allow those who do not go to the United States to build a decent life in Australia. Make the ""transitory persons"" already in Australia permanent residents. Close this foul chapter that stains Australia and echoes the darkest moments in its history.

956,1645004208.xml,"       MOSCOW --  A shell or rocket fired at an army checkpoint in southeastern Ukraine on Tuesday gutted a passenger bus and killed 10 people in one of the deadliest attacks on civilians since a precarious cease-fire in the conflict was negotiated in early September. The attack, which Ukrainian officials said was a result of a rocket fired by pro-Russian separatists, coincided with the collapse of plans for a peace summit meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, among the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, leaving no near-term prospects for high-level negotiations to settle the conflict. A spokesman for Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, said this week that she would not attend the meeting without greater evidence of President Vladimir V. Putin's commitment to the cease-fire, which was agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, last September. It has been regularly violated since. A meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries in Berlin on Monday achieved little progress. With diplomacy failing, violence has surged along the contested borders of Ukraine and the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Heavy shelling was reported on Tuesday in the rebel-held city of Donetsk and at the city's airport, which remains under government control. Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's top military commander, during a visit to a NATO base in Poland on Tuesday, called the increase in violence ""a fairly important uptick"" in the conflict, adding that Russia had resupplied the rebels during a lull in the fighting over the holidays. In a statement, Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan of the special monitoring mission to Ukraine for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe noted that the situation had ""significantly deteriorated"" in the last 24 hours. ""For a while, it was just light weapons,"" Michael Bociurkiw, the spokesman for the monitoring mission, said by telephone from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. ""But now we are back to the heavy artillery."" The worst fighting has continued at the Donetsk airport, where an almost constant barrage of fire could be heard throughout the city on Tuesday.  Rebel forces have tried to dislodge the army from the airport since May, with few breaks in the fighting. A rebel leader, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, assailed Kiev for recent shelling attacks against Donetsk, telling journalists that Kiev was violating the cease-fire. ""Donetsk is returning to the life it had before the preliminary negotiations on the cease-fire,"" he said. On Tuesday, a control tower, one of the few features of the once-gleaming airport that had remained recognizable throughout the conflict, finally crumbled under a renewed rebel assault.  Volleys of Grad rockets captured on a live stream camera lit up the evening sky as reports from artillery rumbled through the city. Above all, Tuesday's fighting served as a reminder of the danger that a return to full-scale military conflict would pose to civilians.  More than 4,800 people have died in the conflict since last April, many of them civilians, and according to some estimates, more than one million civilians have been displaced. Each side blamed the other for the attack at the Ukrainian-held checkpoint, which took place in a town called Volnovakha, some 30 miles southwest of Donetsk. Video uploaded to YouTube shortly after the shelling showed Ukrainian soldiers inspecting the crumpled bodies of the victims, many with open wounds, slumped inside a yellow minibus. A patch of snow by the bus was soaked with blood. Several yards away, the videographer discovered a bowling ball-size crater. Vyacheslav Abroskin, the chief of police for the Donetsk region, said that the bus had been hit by a Grad rocket launched from the direction of the village of Dokuchayevsk, which is under rebel control. The attack killed 10 and injured 13, he said. Earlier reports said that 11 people had been killed. ""Having seen that with my own eyes, I can say that this was not done by people, but beasts with no principles, no morals, who must be destroyed,"" Mr. Abroskin said. Denis Pushilin, a rebel leader, told Russian state news outlets that the rebels were not responsible for the attacks, and that they were most likely ""a provocation,"" meaning an attack used to frame the separatists. ""Volnovakha and its outskirts are beyond the reach of our militia's artillery,"" he said.

1241,2052513529.xml,"The alliance between the United States and Western Europe has accomplished great things. It won two world wars in the first half of the 20th century. Then it expanded to include its former enemies and went on to win the Cold War, help spread democracy and build the highest living standards the world has ever known.President Trump is trying to destroy that alliance.Is that how he thinks about it? Who knows. It's impossible to get inside his head and divine his strategic goals, if he even has long-term goals. But put it this way: If a president of the United States were to sketch out a secret, detailed plan to break up the Atlantic alliance, that plan would bear a striking resemblance to Trump's behavior.It would involve outward hostility to the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. Specifically, it would involve picking fights over artificial issues -- not to win big concessions for the United States, but to create conflict for the sake of it.A secret plan to break up the West would also have the United States looking for new allies to replace the discarded ones. The most obvious would be Russia, the biggest rival within Europe to Germany, France and Britain. And just as Russia does, a United States intent on wrecking the Atlantic alliance would meddle in the domestic politics of other countries to install new governments that also rejected the old alliance.Check. Check. Check. Check. Trump is doing every one of these things.He chose not to attend the full G-7 meeting, in Quebec, this past weekend. While he was there, he picked fights. By now, you've probably seen the photograph released by the German government -- of Trump sitting down, with eyebrows raised and crossed arms, while Germany's Angela Merkel and other leaders stand around him, imploring. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, wears a look of defeat.No wonder. The meeting's central disagreements were over tariffs that Trump has imposed for false reasons. He claims that he's merely responding to other countries. But the average current tariff of the United States, Britain, Germany and France is identical, according to the World Bank: 1.6 percent. Japan's is 1.4 percent, and Canada's is 0.8 percent. Yes, every country has a few objectionable tariffs, but they're small -- and the United States is not a victim here.So Trump isn't telling the truth about trade, much as he has lied about Barack Obama's birthplace, his own position on the Iraq War, his inauguration crowd, voter fraud, the murder rate, Mexican immigrants, the Russia investigation, the Stormy Daniels hush money and several hundred other subjects. The tariffs aren't a case of his identifying a real problem but describing it poorly. He is threatening the Atlantic alliance over a lie.If you need more evidence, look at his tweets after leaving the summit. Close readers of Trump's Twitter feed (and I don't envy that title) have learned that he often accuses others of committing his own sins. On Saturday, he called Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, ""very dishonest.""While Trudeau and other historical allies get disdain, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and various aspiring authoritarians are bathed in praise. Trump and his aides have promoted far-right politicians in Germany and elsewhere. In Quebec, he made excuses for Russia's annexation of Crimea and argued that Russia should be readmitted to the G-7. Jay Nordlinger, the conservative writer, asked, ""Why is he talking like an RT host?"" -- RT being Russia Today, a government-funded television network.I don't know the answer. But it's past time to take seriously the only explanation for all of Trump's behavior: He wants to destroy the Western alliance.Maybe it's ideological, and he prefers Putin-style authoritarianism to democracy. Or maybe he has no grand strategy and Putin really does have some compromising information. Or maybe Trump just likes being against what every other modern American president was for.Whatever the reason, his behavior requires a response that's as serious as the threat. As the political scientist Brendan Nyhan pointed out, this past weekend felt like a turning point: ""The Western alliance and the global trading system are coming under the same intense strain that Trump has created for our domestic institutions.""For America's longtime allies, the response means shedding the hopeful optimism that characterized the early approach taken by Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, France's president. Merkel is the right role model. She has been tougher, without needlessly escalating matters, because she has understood the threat all along.For Trump's fellow Republicans, it means putting country over party. A few Republicans, like John McCain, offered appropriately alarmed words in the last two days. Now members of Congress need to do more than send anguished tweets. They should offer legislation that would restrain Trump and hold hearings meant to uncover his motives.For American voters, it means understanding the real stakes of this year's midterm elections. They are not merely a referendum on a tax cut, a health care plan or a president's unorthodox style. They are a referendum on American ideals that are older than any of us.You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

3885,2376887755.xml,"Ineffective monetary policy, scant action from governments, and fear of a leadership void is raising alarm about the pandemic's economic shock.The last time the world seized with panic over an economic catastrophe, those given the job of limiting the damage knew what to do. The global financial crisis of 2008 presented a textbook case of what happens when people lose faith in the banking system all at once. World leaders could rely on lessons gleaned from history to forge a plan: They flooded the markets with money and waited for calm to return.But this time, as economic overseers confront a pandemic that has sent stock markets hurtling downward while provoking talk of a global recession, their tools appear impotent. The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail. Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.""In many ways it's far worse than 2008,"" said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist. ""There was a sense that 2008 was a show that we had seen before -- the panic of 1907, the Great Depression. We know about financial crises. We knew that it was just money, and that one way or the other the government would step in and save the bankers from their folly.""This time, Mr. Stiglitz added, the cause of the emergency is not bankers and their exotic and dangerous creations but the natural sphere -- a less predictable realm. The fundamental threat to the global economy is the spread of the coronavirus. Yet the means of containing its spread entail worsening the economic pain by keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce.This is playing out as corporations are bearing historic levels of debt. A profound economic downturn could trigger a cascade of defaults. That could prompt creditors to pull back on lending, starving economies of capital.Central banks appear largely ineffective in the face of this reality, while governments have been slow to deliver public money. Not least, investors fear a leadership vacuum. A global pandemic is unfolding, threatening life and livelihood on six continents, just as the world is roiled by an upsurge in nationalism, protectionism and a pushback to globalization. That appears to be hampering the response, reinforcing borders rather than inspiring coordinated action across them.A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear -- a feedback loop.""This is a shock arising out of the real economy, out of the real world, out of biology, not out of financial shenanigans or complexities,"" said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""We are much less well suited to deal with this.""On Friday, world leaders were readying measures aimed at dispelling that impression. In Washington, the Trump administration and Congress neared agreement on a spending package to help workers and companies harmed by the pandemic. In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would set aside its longstanding aversion to debt while spending as needed to preserve public health and protect businesses.But those actions -- while a potentially crucial source of relief for people and businesses -- cannot snuff out the basic threat to the world economy. Only the containment of the pandemic can achieve that. And that objective unavoidably involves worsening the economic straits in the immediate term.Much as in 2008, markets have been plunging because investors have grown terrified of every variable as imaginations run toward dark places. In normal times, markets process gradations of risk, pricing stocks and bonds according to the probability that something bad could transpire. In times of panic, markets avoid all risk as existential.That psychology was so fierce in 2008 that nearly every market threatened to break down. The world is nowhere near that level of panic now, even as stock markets dropped further on Thursday than any day during the global financial crisis.But some elements appear more perilous.Investors grasp that the traditional crisis response -- central banks dropping interest rates -- is effectively inoperative. Rates are already so low in the United States, and negative in Europe and Japan, that pushing them lower yields scant benefits. Cheaper credit does not bring workers back to factories or shoppers back to malls so long as the virus remains a threat.As the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have intervened with emergency measures, each has precipitated a fresh plunge in stock markets. The central banks sought to boost confidence by demonstrating their resolve. But markets divined a different message: The world was on fire, and the fire department was out of water.For years, economists have been saying that governments need to wean themselves of their reliance on central banks to spur economic growth, while spending their own money.Britain responded this week, unveiling a budget that included 30 billion pounds (about $38 billion) to address the pandemic. Italy has outlined plans to spend 25 billion euros (about $28 billion). The United States has so far found only $8.3 billion, though more is apparently on the way.Europe has a history of crippling recriminations in the face of crisis. Within the 19 countries that share the euro currency, Germany has effectively stymied calls for more generous public spending, posing doubts about the follow-through on Ms. Merkel's muscular promises.China, the worst-hit country, is a much larger part of the world economy than a decade ago, yet increasingly limited by worries about its own mounting debts.The most profound alarm may be the perception that the overseers of policy are not adequately committed to the challenge, especially the leader of the world's largest economy, the United States.President Trump initially portrayed the outbreak as a hoax perpetrated by his political enemies to damage him. His speech to the nation on Wednesday evening -- during which he blamed a ""foreign virus"" for the pandemic and announced a severing of flights between the United States and Europe -- resonated as a sign that he was managing the optics of the crisis rather than the crisis itself.The markets have been yearning for evidence that higher powers will deploy unrestrained resources toward relief. What they have seen time and again is that the people in charge lack the appropriate resources for the job, or are unwilling to use them.Economic historians may debate for centuries how policymakers in the United States and Europe responded to the global financial crisis -- whether they were too generous to the bankers and too parsimonious to ordinary people; whether financial interests captured the regulators. But most take as a given that the governments in charge mounted a sincere effort to set things right -- a stark contrast to the mood now.""The fact that financial markets went markedly into shock,"" Mr. Posen said, ""has to be attributed to a lack of confidence in policies and leadership. It's a failure of worldview. Bush and Obama believed in reality.""Conventional wisdom holds that the pandemic will be confined to the economic sphere, damaging livelihoods but falling short of triggering a financial crisis. The banks are in far stronger shape now, the logic goes, having been forced by chastened regulators to set aside reserves.The crisis of 2008 forced economic policymakers to grapple with the interconnection of financial players around the world. The masters of money had taken mortgages and packaged them into exotic combinations, selling them to institutions that used them as collateral against other investments.Only after home prices declined did the markets grasp the extent of the interlinkage. The assets were hard to value, and the liabilities were hidden in a tangle of unorthodox contracts. The markets froze in bewilderment and fright.This time, the forces of decline are more conventional, limiting the scope for panic. Airlines are suffering along with hotels, cruise ships, and oil and gas companies. That is hurting stock prices and challenging their ability to pay back debts. But even if they go bust, markets will still function, with prices adjusting to the new realities.""This is a severe and temporary shock,"" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Oslo. ""Things are going to improve in the second half of the year. It doesn't have to entail that we are in a downward spiral.""The biological origins of the crisis present a natural form of insurance that was not present when Wall Street wizards concocted unlimited quantities of financial derivatives. ""The natural arc of even the worst epidemics is that they are finite in duration,"" Mr. Posen said. ""When the worst of the epidemic is over, people will go back to normal.""But some argue that such depictions rest on excessive faith in the solidity of the financial system.Banks retain creative powers to embellish their books by moving liabilities elsewhere. ""Balance sheet numbers look better, but they fool you,"" said Anat R. Admati, an economist at the Stanford Graduate School of BusinessThe ratings agencies that played a central role in the last crisis -- affirming as wholesome the poisonous mortgages scattered around the earth -- retain status as the official arbiters of risk. ""There was no real reform of the ratings agencies,"" Ms. Admati said.By the end of last year, total outstanding debt among corporations other than financial institutions had surged to a record $13.5 trillion worldwide, roughly double the level of 2008, according to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Many companies have sold riskier bonds to finance expansions.Just as in 2008, investors are confronting huge variables that outnumber solid facts. Will the virus weaken as the seasons change? Will it mutate and become even more virulent?If the pandemic goes on long enough, it could ravage economies and bring down companies, threatening their ability to pay their debts.""Large economic shocks have a proclivity to turn into financial shocks,"" said Mr. Stiglitz, the economist. ""There is every reason to believe that things will get much worse.""The pandemic has sent stock markets hurtling downward and provoked talk of a global recession. Traditional tools to repair the economy seem ineffective. Left, a worker disinfecting a residential building in Beijing.

198,433759720.xml,"      Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party limped to an anemic victory in the hotly contested election in the state of Hesse on Sunday. Her Christian Democrats could yet lose control of the state, depending on the outcome of coalition negotiations, for the first time in nine years. The strength of the challenge by the Social Democrats in Hesse and the surprising success of a small far-left party provide more evidence of a much discussed shift left by Europe's biggest economy. But the Christian Democrats stemmed any talk of outright disaster by cruising to a clear victory in the day's other election, in Lower Saxony.   The  Christian Democrats had everything to lose going into the elections. The party controlled both state governments after unusually strong showings in 2003, levels it was unlikely to sustain in a normal election year. Roland Koch, state premier in Hesse, held an absolute majority in the Parliament for the Christian Democrats. Mr. Koch will now be lucky to sneak in as the leader of a coalition government after losing just over 12 percentage points compared with his showing in 2003. Mr. Koch set off a heated nationwide debate over violence by foreign youths, campaigning for tougher penalties for youthful offenders after a high-profile attack in late December in which two young foreigners fractured  the skull of a retiree in the Munich subway system. Opponents and immigrant groups accused him of fear-mongering and populism. At times it seemed as though the entire election was about  Mr. Koch. His opponent, Andrea Ypsilanti, a Social Democrat, ran on a platform of social justice and in particular the need for a minimum wage, a message that seems  to have resonated with voters. After a stinging 20-point defeat in the 2003 election, the Social Democrats made up almost the entire gap and could still end up leading a coalition government in Hesse. The mixed results muddied the implications of these state elections for the national scene, where Mrs. Merkel leads a so-called ''grand coalition'' of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. ''In the short term it will stabilize the grand coalition, because both parties can claim victories,'' said Uwe Andersen, a political scientist at Ruhr University. ''But in the medium term, until the next election in the Bundestag, the differences between the parties will get stronger and reforms ever harder to push through.'' In a repeat of the last federal elections, neither the Christian Democrats nor the Social Democrats won enough votes in Hesse to form a government with their traditional partners, respectively, the pro-business Free Democrats and the left-wing, pro-environment Greens. One possibility is that they too may seek a grand coalition on the state level. In Hesse,  whose largest city is  Frankfurt, the financial center, the Christian Democrats led  the Social Democrats by a tenth of a percentage point. Despite trailing all evening in exit polls and televised projections, the conservative party claimed a slim victory with 36.8 percent of the vote compared with 36.7 percent for its rivals. The Left Party, a combination of disillusioned Social Democrats and former Communists, won 5.1 percent of the vote in Hesse, just clearing the 5 percent hurdle for representation in the state Parliament. While the Left Party is well represented in the eastern part of the country and has parliamentary seats in the northern city-state of Bremen, it has never sat in one of the large western states' Parliaments before. The party made an even stronger showing in Lower Saxony, where it won 7.1 percent of the vote. Dietmar Bartsch, a senior party official, called it a ''breakthrough.'' ''We can make it into any state parliament now, from Schleswig-Holstein to Bavaria,'' he said. Though both are left of center, the Social Democrats have thus far ruled out a coalition in Hesse that included the Left Party. Bitter feelings remain after Social Democrats, most prominently the former finance minister and Social Democratic chairman Oskar Lafontaine, broke away in 2005 to join the new group. An association with former Communists is something many of the mainstream Social Democrats would prefer to avoid, at least in the western part of the country. An alliance would not be unprecedented, however. The city government in Berlin is a so-called red-red coalition of the Social Democrats and the Left Party. Mrs. Merkel's party won comfortably in Lower Saxony. There, the Christian Democrats, led by Christian Wulff, defeated the Social Democrats in the home state of the automaker Volkswagen with 42.5 percent compared with 30.3 percent. That margin will allow the Christian Democrats to continue their coalition government with the Free Democrats. Meanwhile, there will be plenty of opportunities for momentum to shift with elections coming  in Hamburg at the end of February and in Bavaria in September.

524,2396558878.xml,"An ""unprecedented"" fall in fossil fuel use, driven by the Covid-19 crisis, is likely to lead to a nearly 8 percent drop, according to new research.WASHINGTON -- Global greenhouse gas emissions are on track to plunge nearly 8 percent this year, the largest drop ever recorded, as worldwide lockdowns to fight the coronavirus have triggered an ""unprecedented"" decline in the use of fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency said in a new report on Thursday.But experts cautioned that the drop should not be seen as good news for efforts to tackle climate change. When the pandemic subsides and nations take steps to restart their economies, emissions could easily soar again unless governments make concerted efforts to shift to cleaner energy as part of their recovery efforts.""This historic decline in emissions is happening for all the wrong reasons,"" said Fatih Birol, the agency's executive director. ""People are dying and countries are suffering enormous economic trauma right now. The only way to sustainably reduce emissions is not through painful lockdowns, but by putting the right energy and climate policies in place.""More than 4 billion people are living in countries that have imposed partial or more extensive shutdowns on economic activity to slow the spread of the virus. By mid-April, the report found, energy use in many of those countries was 17 percent to 25 percent lower than it was in 2019, as factories idled, employees stopped driving to work and airlines grounded their flights.The agency currently expects many governments to start relaxing those restrictions later in the year, as China has already done and as some states are starting to do in the United States. Even so, the report said, global carbon dioxide emissions were projected to fall by roughly 2.6 billion tons this year, an 8 percent drop from 2019.That would put global emissions back at levels last seen in 2010, wiping out an entire decade of growth in the use of fossil fuels worldwide. The projected annual drop in emissions would be six times the size of the decline seen after the global financial crisis in 2009 and a far bigger drop than at any point during the Great Depression or at the end of World War II, when much of Europe lay in ruins.Still, there are many uncertainties around the early estimates.If countries remain locked down for longer than expected, or if businesses struggle to recover from the pandemic, the drop in emissions could be larger. By contrast, getting the virus under control faster would mean a smaller dip in emissions this year.The report also noted that, after past crises, global emissions have typically shot back up to previous levels once the initial shock passed. And if countries like China try to help their ailing economies by relaxing environmental rules or subsidizing polluting industries like coal or steel, the resulting rebound in emissions could be even larger than the decline.That's what happened after the financial crisis a decade ago: By 2010, global emissions had surged back higher than ever before as nations invested heavily in fossil fuels to lift themselves out of the recession.""One of the big question marks now is whether countries decide to put clean energy at the heart of their economic stimulus packages,"" Mr. Birol said.This week, leaders from Germany, Britain, Japan and elsewhere held a video conference urging nations to invest in technology to reduce emissions, such as solar power or electric vehicles, as they chart their economic recovery efforts. ""There will be a difficult debate about the allocation of funds,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. ""But it is important that recovery programs always keep an eye on the climate.""For now, the current crisis has dramatically reshaped the global energy landscape.The world's use of oil fell nearly 5 percent in the first quarter of this year, the report said. By March, global road transport was down nearly 50 percent, and air traffic was down 60 percent, compared to 2019. That slump in fuel demand has caused crude prices to crash worldwide, straining the budgets of major oil producers like Saudi Arabia and pushing drilling companies in places like Texas to the brink of bankruptcy.The world's use of coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, fell nearly 8 percent in the first quarter of the year. Much of that was triggered by early coronavirus shutdowns in China, the world's biggest coal user. But even though Chinese coal plants are now firing back up, the global coal industry faces a continued threat from cheaper and cleaner energy sources like natural gas and renewables.By contrast, wind and solar power have seen a slight uptick in demand during the pandemic.One big reason for that: Many countries are using significantly less electricity as office buildings, restaurants and movie theaters close. But because existing wind turbines and solar panels cost little to operate, they tend to get priority on electric grids, which means they are still operating closer to full capacity, while fossil-fuel plants are allowed to run less frequently.Despite the record drop in emissions, scientists cautioned that the world faces an enormous task in getting global warming under control.The United Nations has said that global emissions would have to fall nearly 8 percent every single year between now and 2030 if countries hoped to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), which world leaders have deemed necessary for avoiding catastrophic social, economic and environmental damage from climate change.""A lockdown is just a one-off event, it can't get you all the way there,"" said Glen Peters, research director at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway.He pointed out that even amid the sweeping lockdowns, the global economy continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels for all the power plants, trucks, planes, cars and heavy industries that continue to operate during the crisis.While experts noted that the current lockdowns won't last forever, some expressed hope that they might reveal some of the benefits of switching to cleaner energy. In recent weeks, for instance, cities like Los Angeles and Milan have seen a dramatic reduction in air pollution and smog as fewer people drive and cars stay off the road.""I hope the striking improvements in air quality we've seen remind us what things could be like if we shifted to green power and electric vehicles,"" said Rob Jackson, an earth scientist at Stanford University.A coal-burning power plant in Megalopolis, Greece. The world's use of coal fell nearly 8 percent in the first quarter, but some fear a return to such dirty fossil fuels in the rush to restart economies when the pandemic subsides.

2212,912242568.xml,"      PARIS -- An ethnic Serb accused of being the shadowy smuggler behind recent border clashes in northern Kosovo was arrested in central Serbia late Tuesday, a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned Serbia that it must reach a peace agreement with Kosovo to join the European Union.    Serbia failed to win official European Union candidate status at the European summit meeting this month largely because of German opposition.   The suspect, Zvonko Veselinovic, was charged with arms smuggling. A powerful figure in Mitrovica, a Serbian enclave in Kosovo, Mr. Veselinovic portrayed himself as a businessman and a Serb patriot. But Western diplomats and customs authorities said he was an oil smuggler who was threatened by customs controls imposed by Kosovo, and that he was a central organizer in erecting barricades in Mitrovica that became the front lines of struggle between ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians over the summer and into the fall.    On the surface, it appeared that the blockades grew out of tensions between the factions. But the authorities said Mr. Veselinovic had forged ties with less powerful oil smugglers on the Albanian side. Most recently, Serbian news reports said that Mr. Veselinovic was on the payroll of a Kosovar postal and telecommunications company, PTK, with a contract to install antennas in the north. Last year, handmade bombs exploded at antennas in northern Kosovo belonging to a corporate rival, IPKO, attacks that have never been resolved.    Eulex, the European Union peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, issued a warrant for Mr. Veselinovic's arrest on smuggling and tax evasion charges this year. But international forces had been reluctant to confront Mr. Veselinovic for fear of inciting further violence in the Serb enclave.    The German authorities had steadily increased the pressure to arrest him. Last week, Maj. Gen. Erhard Drews, a German who is the commander of NATO's peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, said international forces had videos of Mr. Veselinovic and his brother, Zarko, directing clashes with armed troops who were trying to dismantle the Mitrovica barricades.    General Drews also said that Mr. Veselinovic had been wounded in the neck by a rubber bullet during a clash that hurt about 30 peacekeepers.    On Monday, Mrs. Merkel made a direct reference to the standoff at the barricades during a visit to the Kosovar capital, Pristina, where she met briefly with Prime Minister Hashim Thaci. ""We made it clear in direct talks with Serbia what we want: The need to come to a regulation of the traffic of goods, which is currently not possible because of the barricades,"" she said.   Mr. Veselinovic and his brother were apprehended the next day on Mount Kopaonik in Serbia by Serbian intelligence agents.       ",2011-12-22
4103,1844186907.xml,"       BERLIN -- Yorai Feinberg was going about his daily routine this month when his social media feeds and cellphone began lighting up. It was the 78th anniversary of the Kristallnacht, the 1938 Nazi pogrom against Jews, and the Berlin restaurant owned by Mr. Feinberg, a 35-year-old Israeli, had been included without his knowledge on a map of the city that a far-right group had published on Facebook. The social media post listed the names -- and addresses -- of local Jewish institutions and Israeli-owned businesses under the banner ""Jews Among Us,"" in bright yellow Gothic script. Mr. Feinberg soon received anonymous phone calls telling him, ""I hate Jews."" A standoff quickly developed between Facebook, the social media giant, and German authorities over what many here said was its inadequate response to the publication of the map. But Germany's rules on what may be said or published -- among the world's toughest, with long prison terms for denying the Holocaust and inciting hatred against minorities -- ensured that the post was eventually deleted. The incident is one of several examples -- including threats of regulation and attempts to prosecute Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg -- of how Germany has become an important test case globally for how the social network polices what may be published online, and how it should respond to inappropriate and illegal content. Such steps in Germany are part of a growing push around the world to regulate what users are allowed to post online. Mr. Feinberg did not report the incident to Facebook, convinced after previous anti-Semitic attacks that the social network would not act, he said. ""I have reported things to Facebook at least 20 times,"" he explained over coffee at his restaurant in a residential neighborhood in western Berlin. ""And 100 percent of the time, they have refused to take it down. Facebook doesn't do anything."" Others identified in the map did complain. At first, Facebook did not remove the map, saying it complied with the company's ""community standards,"" or guidelines for what it deems within the bounds of free speech. But within 48 hours, after an outcry on social media, in local newspapers and from German lawmakers, Facebook relented. It deleted the far-right group's entire page, including the post that had listed the Jewish institutions and businesses across Berlin. ""We recognize that this is a work in progress,"" Richard Allen, Facebook's director of policy in Europe, said in an interview. ""It was hate speech, and it should have been taken down."" In Germany, more than almost anywhere else in the West, lawmakers, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, are demanding that Facebook go further to police what is said on the social network -- a platform that now has 1.8 billion users worldwide. The country's lawmakers also want other American tech giants to meet similar standards. The often-heated dispute has raised concerns over maintaining freedom of speech while protecting vulnerable minorities in a country where the legacy of World War II and decades under Communism still resonate. It is occurring amid mounting criticism of Facebook in the United States after fake news reports were shared widely on the site before the presidential election. Facebook also has been accused of allowing similar false reports to spread during elections elsewhere. Mr. Zuckerberg has denied that such reports swayed American voters. But lawmakers in the United States, Germany and beyond are pressing Facebook to clamp down on hate speech, fake news and other misinformation shared online, or face new laws, fines or other legal actions. ""Facebook has a certain responsibility to uphold the laws,"" said Heiko Maas, the German justice minister. In October, Mr. Maas suggested the company could be held criminally liable for users' illegal hate speech postings if it does not swiftly remove them. Facebook rejects claims that it has not responded to the rise in hate speech in Germany and elsewhere, saying it continually updates its community standards to weed out inappropriate posts and comments. It says such material represents a small fraction of the millions of posts daily, and argues there is a fine balance between protecting freedom of expression and stamping out internet hate speech. ""We've done more than any other service at trying to get on top of hate speech on our platform,"" Mr. Allen said. Tussles with German lawmakers are nothing new for Facebook. It has routinely run afoul of the country's strict privacy rules. In September, a local regulator blocked WhatsApp, the internet messaging service owned by Facebook, from sharing data from users in Germany with its parent company. The country's officials also have questioned whether Facebook's control of users' digital information could breach antitrust rules, accusations the company denies. Facebook's problems with hate speech posts in Germany began in summer 2015 as more than one million refugees began to enter the country. Their arrival, according to company executives and lawmakers, incited an online backlash from Germans opposed to the swell of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries. The number of hateful posts on Facebook increased sharply. As such content spread quickly online, senior German politicians appealed directly to Facebook to comply with the country's laws. Even Ms. Merkel confronted Mr. Zuckerberg in New York in September 2015 about the issue. In response, Facebook updated its global community standards, which also apply in the United States, to give greater protection to minority groups, primarily to calm German concerns. Facebook also agreed to work with the government, local charities and other companies to fight online hate speech, and recently started a billboard and television campaign in Germany to answer local fears over how it deals with hate speech and privacy. Facebook hired a tech company based in Berlin to monitor and delete illegal content, including hate speech, from Germany and elsewhere, working with Facebook's monitoring staff in Dublin. ""They have gotten better and quicker at handling hate speech,"" said Martin Drechsler, managing director of FSM, a nonprofit group that has worked with Facebook on the issue. Despite these steps, German officials are demanding further action. Ms. Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term in general elections next year, warned lawmakers last week that hate speech and fake news sites were influencing public opinion, raising the possibility of new regulations. And Mr. Maas, the justice minister, has repeatedly warned that he will propose legislation if Facebook cannot remove at least 70 percent of online hate speech within 24 hours by early next year. It now removes less than 50 percent, according to a study published in September by a group that monitors hate speech, a proportion that is still significantly higher than those for Twitter and YouTube, the report found. For Chan-Jo Jun, a lawyer in Würzburg, an hour's drive from Frankfurt, new laws governing Facebook cannot come soon enough. Mr. Jun recently filed a complaint with Munich authorities, seeking prosecution of Mr. Zuckerberg and other senior Facebook executives on charges they failed to sufficiently tackle the widespread wave of hate speech in Germany. The company denies the accusations. While his complaint may be dismissed, Mr. Jun says the roughly 450 hate speech cases that he has collected, more than half of them aimed at refugees, show that Facebook is not complying with German law. Despite its global size, he insists, the company cannot skirt its local responsibilities. ""I know Facebook wants to be seen as a global giant,"" Mr. Jun said. ""But there's no way around it. They have to comply with German law."" ""Vaterland"" (""Fatherland""), a Mural by GüNther Schaefer That Depicts a Star of David On a German Flag, Is Painted On the Remains of the Berlin Wall.

2598,1881729013.xml,"LONDON -- On Wednesday, Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, is to deliver a letter to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, informing him that after 44 years of membership, her nation is leaving the European Union. Approximately two years later, after negotiating the terms of that departure, the union will lose at a stroke ""an eighth of its population, a sixth of its G.D.P., half its nuclear-arms cache and a seat on the U.N. Security Council,"" as Susan Watkins, the editor of New Left Review, noted recently.Ms. Watkins is a ""Lexiteer,"" as left-wing supporters of 'Brexit' like me are known. We were hardly a significant force among the 52 percent of Britons who voted to leave in the referendum of June 23. But we were an influence. A counterweight to the anti-immigrant fear mongering of the former leader of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage, Lexiteers argued a left-wing, democratic and internationalist case for Brexit. The position was expressed crisply by Perry Anderson, the former longtime editor of New Left Review: ""The E.U. is now widely seen for what it has become: an oligarchic structure, riddled with corruption, built on a denial of any sort of popular sovereignty, enforcing a bitter economic regime of privilege for the few and duress for the many.""Although Lexiteers have little patience for the national nihilism of ""Davos Man,"" the globalist elite, we are no xenophobes. We voted Leave because we believe it is essential to preserve the two things we value most: a democratic political system and a social-democratic society. We fear that the European Union's authoritarian project of neoliberal integration is a breeding ground for the far right. By sealing off so much policy, including the imposition of long-term austerity measures and mass immigration, from the democratic process, the union has broken the contract between mainstream national politicians and their voters. This has opened the door to right-wing populists who claim to represent ""the people,"" already angry at austerity, against the immigrant.It was the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek, the intellectual architect of neoliberalism, who called in 1939 for ""interstate federalism"" in Europe to prevent voters from using democracy to interfere with the operation of the free market. Simply put, as Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission (the union's executive body), did: ""There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.""The union's structures and treaties are designed accordingly. The European Commission is appointed, not elected, and it is proudly unaccountable to any electorate. ""We don't change our position according to elections"" was how the commission's vice president Jyrki Katainen greeted the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in Greece in 2015.The European Parliament is not a real parliament. It is not a legislature; its deputies neither offer manifestoes nor carry out the ideas they propose to voters. Elections in improbably large constituencies, with pitifully low turnouts, change nothing. As a Parliament staff member said at  the European Research Seminar at the London School of Economics, ""The only people who listen to M.E.P.s are the interpreters,"" referring to the members of the Parliament.The European Council, an intergovernmental body where decisive legislative power actually lies, especially for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, comprises member countries' heads of state, who generally meet just four times a year. They are not directly elected by the inhabitants of the nations whose fate they decide. As for the union principle of ""subsidiarity,"" a supposed preference for decentralized governance, it is ignored in all practical matters.The wishes of electorates are regularly brushed aside. When, in 2005, a proposed European Constitution was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands (most governments did not even allow a vote), this meant nothing to the proponents of the European Project. A few cosmetic tweaks, and the constitution was imposed anyway; only then, it was called the Lisbon Treaty. (Ireland, the only state to allow a referendum on the treaty, voted against it. So Ireland was told to vote again until it got it right. That's democracy, European Union-style.)Whatever the union could have been, since the 1980s it has made neoliberal economics an integral part of the project. By doing so, the union transformed itself into what the German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck has called ""a powerful engine of liberalization in the service of a deep economistic restructuring of social life."" The single market, the Maastricht Treaty, the single currency and the Stability and Growth Pact combined to impose policies of deregulation, privatization, anti-labor rules, regressive tax regimes, cuts to welfare and financialization, and put them beyond the will of the people.Noting that the tools of Keynesian economics, upon which social democracy relies, are now illegal in Europe, even The Economist got queasy, writing that this arrangement ""feels politically very dodgy."" As for the European Union-United States trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it reads like Hayek's midcentury fantasy come to life, potentially empowering corporations to sue elected governments for daring to listen to what their electors want.Another key institution of the neoliberal union is the European Central Bank. Unelected and unaccountable, the bank's governors are committed by treaty to favor deflation over growth, to prohibit state aid to stricken industries and to enforce austerity measures. Likewise, the single currency acts as an economic chokehold on entire regions of Europe, which can neither devalue their currency (as sovereign nations can) to become competitive nor grow their way out of stagnation because they are forced by austerity to shrink their economy.The human cost has been grotesque. The European Union's economic waterboarding of Greece resulted in a quarter cut from hospital budgets and spending on drugs halved, while rates of H.I.V. infection spiked, cases of major depression doubled, suicide attempts rose by one-third, and the number of stillborn babies rose by 21 percent. Four in 10 Greek children were pushed into poverty, and one survey estimated that 54 percent of Greeks have become undernourished. Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to Manuel Barroso, then the president of the European Commission, observed that as ""Europe's creditor in chief"" Germany ""has trampled over values like democracy and national sovereignty and left a vassal state in its wake.""In extremis, elected national governments are effectively forced out and replaced by compliant technocrats, as George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy discovered. Sitting atop it all is the European Court of Justice, which issued rulings that the workers' right to strike was subordinate to employers' right do business freely. Hayek must be smiling.Though the Leave slogan was mocked, Brexit really was about ""taking back control."" Democracy needs a demos, a people for whom government is of, by and for. Without one, all you have is inter-elite management, treaty law and money grubbing. But how will ""the people"" be constructed? Politics will decide. A left populism will not seek to define the people as the far right does, in opposition to the immigrant other, but in opposition to those powerful neoliberal elites that are no longer able, as Professor Streeck says, ""to build a social framework around the hot core of capitalist profit making.""It has been a colossal error by Davos Man left-wingers to think of nation-states as embarrassing anachronisms hostile to democracy. Far from being a threat to democracy, the nation-state is the only stable underpinning we have yet devised to sustain the commitments, sacrifices and levels of social trust that a democracy and a welfare state require.Right now, the left in Europe is playing by someone else's rule book in a rigged game. One part of each nation, the winners, have been ""using the globalized world as their extended playing field,"" as Professor Streeck put it. One, if not the only, meaning of Brexit is that, having lost faith in glib promises of a globalization for all, the other part of the nation -- the losers, the shutout and the disdained -- have decided, in desperation, to make a sovereign gesture: to change the rules by returning to nation-state politics in order to have a go at leveling things up. They are ""seeking refuge,"" in Professor Streeck's words, in ""democratic protection, popular rule, local autonomy, collective goods and egalitarian traditions.""Rather than leave the field to the nativist right, some of us on the democratic left are going with them.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.ALAN JOHNSON   Alan Johnson is a senior research fellow at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Center and the editor of its online journal, Fathom.

2395,1544719104.xml,"       RIO DE JANEIRO --  Brazil suffered mightily with its national team's 7-1 rout at the hands of Germany in the World Cup semifinals last week, but the authorities here breathed sighs of relief as the tournament came to a close on Sunday with Germany's victory over Argentina, amid muted street protests and a display of Brazil's ability to successfully organize sporting megaevents. ""The Cup would have been perfect, except for the lack of the sixth championship,"" Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, said in a brief speech at Maracanã, the stadium that was turned into a militarized zone after security forces severely restricted access over concerns that demonstrations could disrupt the final match. Brazilian soccer fans, who traditionally view Argentina as their chief rival, seemed to be generally pleased with the result of the game. When Germany scored its only goal in the 113th minute, securing victory in extra time, fireworks were set off across the city. ""The pope may be Argentine, but God is Brazilian,"" said Aldo Malizia, 66, a Brazilian retiree, using a common saying and referring to the nationality of Pope Francis. The rivalry brought some tension to the streets of Rio. ""The Brazilians are cheering after losing so badly, 7-1,"" said Cristian Leyes, 33, the owner of a small tourism business in Buenos Aires who was one of some 100,000 Argentine fans visiting Brazil for the game. ""They have always been our rivals in soccer, but this is beyond upsetting. It makes no sense."" In the beachfront district of Copacabana, Carlos Abran, 52, a doctor from Santa Fe province in Argentina and who was wearing an Argentina jersey, said someone jeered at him over his country's loss. ""I am angry not because we lost the actual game,"" he said. ""What makes me angry is that I don't understand why the Brazilian people have to party at our disgrace.""  Though there were reports of a brawl between Brazilians and Argentines in Copacabana, one group of Argentines seemed determined to be festive on Sunday night, banging drums and singing and dancing. ""We came a very long way, and we're going to have a good time,"" said Lucas Mazzola, 38, a casino worker from the province of Córdoba.  ""Yes, this defeat hurts my soul, it hurts my heart,"" he added. ""But we're a country where despite all the problems we are facing, we're a happy people."" Brazil's political fissures were exposed on the global stage when Brazilian fans inside the stadium booed Rousseff, who is running for re-election this year, and took up offensive chants about her. She faced similar insults at the opening match a month ago -- she did not attend any other games -- reflecting spreading disenchantment with her leftist government among some Brazilians who are prosperous enough to afford tickets to World Cup matches. The authorities had assembled what ranked as one of the largest security operations ever in Brazil, with 25,000 soldiers and police officers giving Rio a martial feel throughout the day with sirens blaring and motorcades halting traffic. About a mile from the stadium, several hundred police officers violently dispersed a small protest that largely focused criticism on the handling of the tournament by FIFA, the scandal-ridden organization which oversees global soccer. The police used tear gas and pepper spray in the confrontation that left at least six people hurt, including a photojournalist and a police officer. Before the game began on Sunday, a sweep by the police on Saturday in Rio and other Brazilian cities detained at least a dozen activists, pointing to efforts by the authorities to prevent demonstrations from escalating during the closing of the tournament and the growing use of intelligence operations to infiltrate protest movements. ""The protests haven't been that big because treatment of protesters by police, and how they are covered in the media, is very negative,"" said Rebecca Tanuta, 27, a student who helping provide medical assistance to injured protesters. ""People are afraid to go out onto the streets, or they think protesters are just hoodlums."" Even as concerns persisted that more trouble could unfold in the hours after the last game, the World Cup ended largely as it had unfolded over the last month, without major complications. In the weeks leading up to the tournament, a wave of strikes by public employees and delays in finishing World Cup projects had heightened fears about Brazil's organization of the event. In something of a victory lap, Rousseff dined on Sunday with a group of foreign leaders who had come here to see the game, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia (which will host the tournament in 2018), Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, President Ali Bongo of Gabon, and Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar of Trinidad and Tobago. Brazil, seeking to build on the international exposure of the country during the World Cup, is set to also host in the coming days ahead a gathering of leaders from Russia, India, China and South Africa, all members of the so-called BRICS group of developing nations.  But on Sunday, many Brazilians seemed focused as much on domestic politics and the event's final match, after their government used huge public loans to build lavish stadiums. ""I'm a lot happier now than I would be if Brazil had actually won,"" said Gilson Bruno da Silva, 28, a bartender at a Copacabana restaurant. ""This was the best possible outcome because otherwise we would have forgotten all about the problems plaguing the country right now.""

3714,1728502361.xml,"       SUMTE, Germany --  This bucolic, one-street settlement of handsome redbrick farmhouses may for the moment have many more cows than people, but next week it will become one of the fastest growing places in Europe. Not that anyone in Sumte is very excited about it. In early October, the district government informed Sumte's mayor, Christian Fabel, by email that his village of 102 people just over the border in what was once Communist East Germany would take in 1,000 asylum seekers. His wife, the mayor said, assured him it must be a hoax. ""It certainly can't be true"" that such a small, isolated place would be asked to accommodate nearly 10 times as many migrants as it had residents, she told him. ""She thought it was a joke,"" he said. But it was not. Sumte has become a showcase of the extreme pressures bearing down on Germany as it scrambles to find shelter for what, by the end of the year, could be well over a million people seeking refuge from poverty or wars in Africa, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. In a small concession to the villagers, Alexander Götz, a regional official from Lower Saxony, told them this week that the initial number of refugees, who start arriving on Monday and will be housed in empty office buildings, would be kept to 500, and limited to 750 in all. Nevertheless, the influx is testing the limits of tolerance and hospitality in Sumte, and across Germany. It is also straining German politics broadly, creating deep divisions in the conservative camp of Chancellor Angela Merkel and energizing a constellation of extremist groups that feel their time has come. One of the few people, in fact, who seem enthusiastic about the plan for Sumte is Holger Niemann, 32, an admirer of Hitler and the lone neo-Nazi on the elected district council. He rejoices at the opportunities the migrant crisis has offered. ""It is bad for the people, but politically it is good for me,"" Mr. Niemann said of the plan, which would leave the German villagers outnumbered by migrants by more than seven to one. Germans face ""the destruction of our genetic heritage"" and risk becoming ""a gray mishmash,"" Mr. Niemann added, predicting that public anxiety over Ms. Merkel's open-armed welcome to refugees would help demolish a postwar political consensus in Germany built on moderation and compromise. Unlike those in other European countries, far-right parties in Germany have had little success in national elections, and remain firmly rejected by the overwhelming majority of Germans. Reinhold Schlemmer, a former Communist who served as the mayor here before and immediately after the collapse of East Germany, said people like Mr. Niemann would ""have been put in prison right away"" during the Communist era. ""Now they can stand up and preach,"" he said. ""People say this is democracy, but I don't think it is democracy to let Nazis say what they want."" Mr. Schlemmer is among those concerned that extremists are exploiting widespread concerns, even in the political mainstream, over absorbing vast numbers of refugees, as the influx tests Germany's capacity to cope. Sumte has no shops, no police station, no school. The initial number of arrivals was, in fact, reduced to avoid straining the local sewage system and give time for new pumps to be installed. ""We have zero infrastructure here for so many people,"" Mr. Fabel, the mayor, said. As the federal government desperately scrambles to find shelter for the refugees before winter sets in, it is assigning quotas to each of Germany's 16 Länder, or states, based on factors like economic strength and population. Initially, the migrants were housed in renovated homes, then in gymnasiums, military bases and old schools, but as obvious shelters run out, the authorities are hunting for any free space they can find, like the 23 empty office buildings in Sumte. Dirk Hammer, a Sumte resident, said that he felt sympathy for the refugees, but that he feared the sheer number of people dumped with little warning in places like this could offer ""an ideal platform for the far right."" ""I get stomachaches from fear of what is going to happen -- not just here but in the whole of Germany,"" he said. At least for the moment, the tolerant values of people like Mr. Hammer have proved resilient, even as Mr. Niemann and like-minded neo-Nazis deride such views as alien imports imposed by the United States and other World War II victors. When Mr. Niemann took the floor at a meeting in October between villagers and regional officials responsible for migrants, Mr. Hammer snatched away the microphone. ""We have to take a clear stand against these people,"" Mr. Hammer said later, noting that his family had lived in Sumte for 400 years. He dismissed Mr. Niemann, who lives in a village a couple of miles down the road, as a disruptive outsider. Mr. Hammer himself initially reacted with horror when he heard of plans to move refugees into the empty office complex, built by a now-defunct debt collection company. He wrote an angry open letter on Facebook expressing his fury as a longtime supporter of Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party who felt betrayed. ""If we are being used as a dumping ground, this shows the situation is out of hand,"" Mr. Hammer said in an interview at his family's home, a modernized farmhouse. But he has curbed his anger and rallied to efforts by the mayor, Mr. Fabel, to make sure that extremists do not capitalize on the widespread unease among residents. He said he knew people who ""are not far right, but who are afraid and their fear is being exploited."" Unable to speak at the village meeting last month, Mr. Niemann and a handful of followers heckled speakers who voiced sympathy for refugees, and waved banners demanding an end to ""asylum terror."" At a follow-up meeting between officials and villagers on Wednesday, Mr. Niemann stayed silent, taking notes. An assertion by a senior regional police official that Sumte did not need a permanent police presence prompted one villager to jump to his feet and shout, ""Of course we need protection."" But the discussion was civil and devoid of inflammatory outbursts. ""People are just tired and think that so long as we have enough food in the fridge we are all fine,"" Mr. Niemann said in an interview, frustrated that his efforts to stir resistance to the refugee relocation had gained little traction in Sumte. Other extremists in the area have resorted to blunter methods to get their message across. Shortly after the news first broke of the plans to move 1,000 refugees to Sumte, unidentified arsonists attacked a smaller refugee center in the nearby town of Boizenburg, setting fires and smashing windows. Mr. Niemann said he rejected violence, but a far-right coalition he represents on the district council includes two of Germany's most belligerent groups, the National Democratic Party, better known by its German acronym N.P.D., and Die Rechte, which was last week linked by authorities in Bavaria to a cache of weapons assembled in an alleged plot to attack refugees. ""There are individuals who cannot be controlled at all times,"" said Mr. Niemann, a car washer.  Asked whether he considered himself a neo-Nazi, he said, ""No, I am National Socialist"" -- in other words, a real Nazi. ""We are not extremists, but people have become so soft that we seem extreme,"" he added. Mr. Fabel, the mayor, insisted that Sumte, despite its unease, was open-minded and hospitable, and was now focused on making the refugee holding camp work. ""Many families here suffered during the war, so they will think twice about joining extremists,"" he said. He said he realized that there was no point in trying to block the plan when, at the initial meeting, he asked Mr. Götz, the regional official in charge of finding places for migrants, whether Sumte had any choice. ""You have two options,"" he said he was told. ""Yes, or yes."" Mr. Götz declined to be interviewed. The asylum seekers will stay in Sumte only as long as it takes to process their applications for refugee status. But those who move on will eventually be replaced by new arrivals, as the vast stream of refugees and migrants shows no signs of slowing. ""Life here is going to change,"" the mayor said.

2026,1698568307.xml,"       BERLIN --  Philipp Missfelder, who despite his youth rose swiftly in Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party to become its foreign affairs spokesman, died on July 12 near Coesfeld in North Rhine-Westphalia. He was 35. He suffered a lung embolism, and his wife, a doctor, was unable to revive him, according to the party and the German news media. Mr. Missfelder was known for his strong commitment to the trans-Atlantic partnership and to Israel. He frequently spoke of the need to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and was well connected in Eastern Europe and Russia. He was widely seen as a future cabinet member, even as he established himself outside conventional political channels. Mr. Missfelder had ""an astounding gift for building bridges"" between parties, countries and ideas, the president of Parliament, Norbert Lammert, said on Friday. ""Hardly anybody in the history of the German Parliament built up such a network of contacts in such young years without holding an office in the executive branch."" Mr. Missfelder's rise in conservative politics was unlikely, given his working-class origins in the Ruhr, the industrial heartland of the center-left Social Democrats. Born on Aug. 25, 1979, in Gelsenkirchen, the son of a steelworker, he became involved in conservative politics in high school. By the age of 22 he was in charge of the Junge Union (Young Union), the branch of the Christian Democrats for 14-to-35-year-olds. He built it into one of the strongest youth movements in Europe. At 25, Mr. Missfelder was elected to the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. He joined his party's top leadership at 28 and became foreign policy spokesman at 30. In 2014, Mr. Missfelder served six months as trans-Atlantic coordinator for the German government, but he quit under criticism from conservatives after attending a 70th birthday party for former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a Social Democrat, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The party, hosted by Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom, was also attended by Mr. Schröder's longtime friend President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, weeks after his troops had annexed Crimea. Mr. Missfelder attributed his attraction to conservative politics to his admiration for the chancellor of his youth, Helmut Kohl, who dominated Germany for 16 years until losing to Mr. Schröder in 1998. Mr. Kohl was then unseated as the Christian Democratic leader by Ms. Merkel. But Mr. Missfelder continued to visit and show support for the ousted leader. His broad connections both inside and outside his party led Robin Alexander, a respected Berlin columnist, to note in the newspaper Die Welt that the Bundestag had lost not only one of its youngest but also one of its most experienced deputies. Mr. Missfelder's admiration for Israel and his repeated calls to fight anti-Semitism drew a tribute from the Berlin office of the American Jewish Committee. ""Philipp Missfelder was a dear friend of the U.S., of Israel and of the Jewish people,"" said Deidre Berger, director of the A.J.C. Ramer Institute for German-Jewish Relations. Survivors include Mr. Missfelder's wife, Ann-Christin, and their two daughters.

2906,2455069305.xml,"It is not exactly a rerun of March or April, although it may seem as if it is. France and Germany became the latest European countries to announce restrictions intended to tamp down the resurgent coronavirus, but they appear less intrusive than the measures adopted in the spring. ""Lockdown lite,"" the German news media called the package of rules announced on Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel.Some places in the United States also ordered new restrictions, though on a far more limited scale, as President Trump continued to play down the pandemic, complaining on Twitter that ""Covid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media."" His tweets on Wednesday followed a news release announcing what were described as the administration's first-term scientific accomplishments, among them, in capital letters, ""ENDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.""The president has also repeatedly contended that the increased case counts are the result of more testing. On Wednesday, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, who leads the government's testing effort, said that testing alone could not explain the higher numbers. ""We are at another critical point in the pandemic response,"" he said on the ""Today"" show on NBC, though he noted that hospitalizations were ""below where we were in July, but that is rising.""He added: ""We have the tools to combat this. We can control it, but this is a very important time to do it.""In the United States, where more than 500,000 new coronavirus cases have been tallied in the past week, 26 states are at or close to record numbers for new infections. It took nearly three months to reach the half-million mark at the beginning of the pandemic.XXXIn Europe, where President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country was being ""overpowered by a second wave,"" the new measures were perhaps inevitable. The virus is defying recent local lockdowns -- although a word like ""defying"" risks anthropomorphizing something that is unseen, unseeing and unable to respect man-made boundaries. It just keeps replicating -- and infecting people. The World Health Organization said that new cases in Europe were ""increasing exponentially."" The European region, which by the W.H.O.'s definition includes Russia and Israel, accounted for 1.3 million new cases last week, almost half of the new infections reported worldwide in that time, the organization said.But Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the virus was not the only problem in a world that is feeling spent. ""We're dealing with two enemies: with the coronavirus itself and corona fatigue,"" she said. But she added that ""now is not the time to relax.""So officials moved to reimpose measures aimed at bringing down infection rates and hospitalizations. Intensive-care units in France are full, and one model suggests that hospitalizations are two weeks away from the numbers they reached at the height of the first wave. But Frédéric Valletoux, president of the French Hospital Federation, said on Wednesday that hospitals were in a more precarious situation now than in the spring, because doctors and nurses were still exhausted from the first wave.But officials are trying to keep schools open and their economies chugging this time around. Starting Friday, France will go into a nationwide lockdown until Dec. 1, with just schools and essential businesses staying open. And in Germany, Ms. Merkel announced that restaurants and bars would close, starting Monday. But she said that supermarkets, stores and schools could stay open -- a more targeted approach than the one taken in the spring. As in France, one goal is to ease the pressure on Germany's health system. Coronavirus hospitalizations in the country have doubled in the past 10 days as new cases climbed past 10,000 a day.Another goal is to minimize the economic pain of shutting down segments of the economy that bring people together. Germany will compensate the small- and midsize businesses that shut down, which will include theaters and gyms as well as restaurants and bars. The government will cover up to 75 percent of their losses, up to a total of 10 billion euros.XXXBismarck, N.D., adopted a mask mandate little more than 24 hours after Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, criticized its virus protocols. But the new regulation carries no penalties, and Mayor Steve Bakken, a Republican, voted against it at a City Commission meeting on Tuesday evening after saying that the commission should eliminate bureaucracy, not create it. Dr. Birx visited Bismarck on Monday and said she saw few face coverings and little social distancing,"" a situation she called ""deeply unfortunate."" She appeared with Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican who has resisted ordering statewide mask rules.Another place where masks have been controversial -- Coeur d'Alene, Idaho -- also approved a rule requiring them in public after Mayor Steve Widmyer said that ""doing nothing is not an option."" He added: ""There's going to be some people out there, they're going to say, 'Oh, Widmyer went against his word because he said he would never mandate.' Situations change, and we're in a much different situation"" than earlier in the pandemic. His city is in Kootenai County, where last week a regional health board voted to repeal a mask requirement.In Kansas, where most of the state's 105 counties opted out of a mask mandate in July, Gov. Laura Kelly and leaders in the State Legislature put the possibility of a statewide requirement on hold while they press for local mask rules in hot spots. Ms. Kelly, a Democrat who has feuded with Republicans who control the Legislature over how to manage the pandemic, called their agreed-upon approach ""a strategy of engagement.""XXXThe coronavirus will continue to affect time-honored routines long after Election Day, Thanksgiving and the end-of-year holidays.

265,1709935526.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. LONDON -- As Europe basks in good feelings over its generosity to thousands of migrants and asylum seekers last weekend, critical voices from the political right and far right are poised to become among the biggest beneficiaries of the continuing flow. Parties that have been growing in opposition to immigration, the influence of Islam and the European Union seized on the decision by Austria and Germany to welcome the migrants, pointing out the difficulty of now shutting the migrant tap. And after the shambles of Greece, the image of a European Union seemingly incapable of defending its borders, while trying to impose mandatory quotas on nations for accepting refugees, fit Euroskeptics' portrayal of Brussels as a European Union capital at once incompetent and domineering. ""Germany, Sweden, and Austria deserve great credit for their willingness to accept refugees, but elsewhere on the Continent the reaction ranges from passivity to outright hostility,"" said Michael Haltzel, a visiting senior fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs who advised Joseph R. Biden Jr., now vice president, when he served in the Senate. ""There is a considerable danger of overload. And I fear that the political beneficiaries in many countries will be right-wing ultranationalists."" Carl Bildt, Sweden's former foreign minister, expressed some of the anxiety felt by governing parties when he said that ""at the end of the day, every country is nervous"" about this large group of new migrants, ""though some pretend not to be."" Right now ""there is a tendency to blame everyone else,"" he said, ""but this will be a challenge to every country."" The process of integration into a Western society is difficult and takes time, Mr. Bildt said. ""It's far more than providing the first tent."" Even in Sweden, he noted, which has been the European country most open to Syrian refugees and asylum seekers, the anti-immigration, anti-European Union Sweden Democrats are now ahead of the two largest parties in the opinion polls with about 25 percent, after having won a record 12.9 percent of the vote in last September's elections. ""It's a tremendous breakthrough for us,"" Tommy Nilsson, party manager for southern Sweden, told the Daily Telegraph. ""There's too much immigration and too many beggars from Eastern Europe. People are starting to realize that this is a serious problem for Sweden."" The new rightist government in Denmark has taken out advertisements in the Lebanese press warning refugees not to come, that the government has toughened immigration laws and cut benefits. In France, in a speech on Sunday to her National Front party, which warns about Islam, immigration and a powerful German-dominated Brussels, Marine Le Pen accused Germany of opening its doors to refugees to exploit them for cheap labor, while imposing its immigration policies on its neighbors. ""Germany seeks not only to rule our economy, it wants to force us to accept hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers,"" she said in Marseille. Referring to the death of a Syrian boy in Turkey and other asylum seekers in a truck in Austria, all at the hands of human traffickers, she accused European politicians of ""exploiting the death of the unfortunate in these trips organized by mafia. They show pictures, they exhibit the death of a child without any dignity, just to blame the European consciences and make them accept the current situation."" The Syrian civil war is now in its fifth year, and the numbers are staggering. More than four million Syrians have fled the country and are registered as refugees, while another 6.5 million are internally displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There are more than 1.9 million Syrian refugees in Turkey alone, another 1.1 million in Lebanon and more than 629,000 in Jordan. Europe cannot take them all. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced something close to pride on Monday that Germany is now seen as a desirable and welcoming destination for refugees. ""That is something very valuable, if you look at our history,"" she said. But many fear a backlash. There have been more than 200 attacks on asylum seekers or their shelters this year in Germany. In the pretty south German town of Rottenburg am Neckar, officials are investigating as possible arson a fire that broke out at 2 a.m. Monday, injuring six people, in a facility housing 84. A day earlier, even the partners in Ms. Merkel's center-right bloc, the Christian Social Union, openly criticized her for allowing in tens of thousands of migrants from Hungary and Austria. That ""sends the wrong signal to individual countries,"" said Gerda Hasselfeldt, the party's leader in the federal Parliament. The C.S.U. welcomed a government decision late Sunday to reduce cash allowances for refugees as a victory for their harder line. ""There will be less incentive in the future for unfounded applications for asylum,"" said the party's general secretary, Andreas Scheuer. Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats and vice chancellor, acknowledged that beyond the cheers and handouts of chocolates and toys, there were what he called very real worries, fears and conflicts. ""We have to be realistic about this from the start to avoid disappointments,"" he said. ""We'll manage to take in 800,000 this year, accommodate and integrate them, too. But it is also clear for everyone that that cannot repeat every year."" Germany so far has little trouble with far-right political parties. The nationalist Alternative for Germany has split; the anti-immigrant marches have also died down. But neo-Nazis openly battled police at an asylum facility at Heidenau, near Dresden, last month. In Austria, arson attacks are rare. But a strong populist party, the right-wing Freedom Party, has made noticeable gains in the months of refugee crisis. Austria expects the same proportion of asylum applications, 1 percent of the population, as Germany. In bellwether elections in Vienna in October, the Freedom Party now threatens to outperform the Social Democrats, making inroads particularly among lower classes with strident anti-Muslim rhetoric. Some observers believe the sympathy shown to refugees may have tipped the scales away from the rightists. ""These feelings are transitory, of course, but they won't fade without leaving some trace,"" said Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for the center-left weekly Profil. Austrians have traditionally welcomed migrants and felt good doing so this weekend, particularly since almost none of the arriving thousands planned to stay, he said. ""For us, this feeling of doing good has come almost for free -- at least for the time being."" The issue is sensitive in Britain, too, which last year had net immigration of 330,000 people and where Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure from his own party and from the U.K. Independence Party to bring down the numbers or withdraw from the European Union. Under public pressure, Mr. Cameron has now agreed to take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in the region over the next five years as a humanitarian gesture, and will increase to 1 billion pounds a year humanitarian aid to Syria. Mr. Cameron has promised a referendum on continued British membership in the European Union by the end of 2017, but possibly to take place next autumn. But what appears to be a European mess and more immigration has been a boon for those opposed to continued British membership. Mr. Bildt, of Sweden, says that in the long run, the European Union will come up with some better solutions. ""But we have to find a coherent European response. Controlling the outer border of Schengen is vital to the system,"" he said, referring to the passport-free zone within Europe. ""It is uncomfortable but necessary, and it needs to be done.""

2800,2358204143.xml,"The candidates to lead Angela Merkel's conservative party reflect a pivot away from the chancellor's centrist legacy. All are men from the conservative west.BERLIN -- A week after Angela Merkel's chosen successor threw her conservative party into disarray by announcing she would step down, the candidates who have emerged seem to represent the antithesis of the centrist chancellor from Germany's east.All are men, all hail from the country's former west, and all are pushing a new identity for the party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union. But they also offer very different visions of the future -- some urging continuity with the Merkel era, others a clean break that could even shorten her tenure.Coming at a time when Europe and the world are looking to Germany for renewed leadership, the choice of the next party leader is likely to have ramifications well beyond the party.Uncertainty has enveloped the Christian Democrats since their current leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Ms. Merkel's handpicked successor, announced last week that she would step down after a local chapter broke with party policy and voted with the far-right Alternative for Germany in electing the governor of the state of Thuringia.Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, met Wednesday with several potential candidates, though only one has declared his intention to run. Ms. Merkel, 65, has said she would not interfere with the selection.Traditionally, party delegates choose their leader, but no details or timeline have been announced and the party's delegates are not scheduled to meet until December. The leader of the party in power is typically chancellor as well, but the Christian Democrats split the job 18 months ago, envisioning a future in which Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer would eventually assume the chancellorship.Germans are not expected to elect a new government until October 2021, which means the new leader most likely faces the daunting prospect of uniting a fractured party in the shadow of Ms. Merkel.Alternatively, the leader could try to oust Ms. Merkel early, though she consistently ranks as the country's most popular politician and the party's partners in the government, the Social Democrats, have ruled out supporting a different chancellor.Whoever becomes the Christian Democrats' ninth leader will have to carve out an identity for the party at a time when its conservative and centrist wings are deeply divided and the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is flaunting its ability to upset the country's democratic order.""In terms of style, there are differences between each of the candidates,"" said Martin Florack, professor of political science at Duisburg-Essen University. What is clear, however, is that people want change, he said. ""After the Merkel years, people are sick and tired of the moderate, presidential thing.""Armin Laschet: The Classic ManViewed as the choice who would provide the greatest continuity with the Merkel era, Mr. Laschet, 59, decided against running in the 2018 race for the party leadership. Since then, Mr. Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia and leader of the party's largest state chapter, has been biding his time.Last weekend, he used the international platform of the Munich Security Conference to position himself as rooted in his party's pro-European legacy. But he also focused on changes to the European Union, and criticized Ms. Merkel for taking ""too long to react"" to proposals from President Emmanuel Macron of France.Mr. Laschet has strongly opposed cooperating with the AfD -- drawing a line that the most conservative wing of the party has called into question, at least under some circumstances.""Any cooperation, teamwork, support or coalition with the AfD is unacceptable for the Christian Democrats,"" Mr. Laschet told his party on Feb. 5.Friedrich Merz: The OutsiderMr. Merz, 64, paints himself as an outsider, having been pushed out of the position of party whip in 2002 and leaving politics to make a personal fortune as the head of BlackRock Germany. He has since resigned from that position.That political loss still stings for Mr. Merz, making the prospect of his leading the party alongside Ms. Merkel until fall 2021 hard to imagine, although he has the backing of the country's business leaders and has proved popular with voters.""Mr. Merz would not be able to exist alongside of the chancellor,"" said Tilman Mayer, a professor of political science at Bonn University. ""If he were to be elected party leader, he would try to also take the chancellery, but the Social Democrats would not go along with that.""Still, his pledge to strengthen the Christian Democrats' conservative profile has resonated especially in the country's east, where the party has been bleeding support to the AfD.Jens Spahn: The Young UpstartAt 39, Mr. Spahn is seen by many as too young to have a serious chance at Germany's top job, although in neighboring Austria and France, young leaders have proved their ability to win elections and successfully steer their nations.Mr. Spahn has used his office as Ms. Merkel's minister for health to demonstrate that he is able to enact legislation. He has stressed that Germany will need to move more aggressively into the digital sphere if it hopes to remain competitive.A practicing Roman Catholic who is married to a man, Mr. Spahn potentially appeals to a wide voter base.If Mr. Laschet and Mr. Merz, both from North Rhine-Westphalia, were to find themselves in a head-to-head struggle, Mr. Spahn could emerge as a compromise, Mr. Mayer said.Norbert Röttgen: The Fourth ManIn a move that surprised Berlin, Mr. Röttgen, 54, on Monday became the first candidate to declare his intention to seek the party leadership.Early polls indicated that many voters may consider Mr. Röttgen, a foreign policy expert and former environment minister, to have the best mix of conservative values, political experience and ability to work with both the chancellor and coalition partners.Surveys published on Wednesday showed Mr. Röttgen polling ahead of Mr. Merz, previously the public's favorite.A centrist who was close to the chancellor until she fired him in 2012, Mr. Röttgen, who is chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, has stated that Ms. Merkel should remain in office.He has also insisted that the conservatives focus on environmental issues, a signal, perhaps, that he would be willing to work with the Greens, who have been nipping at the party's heels and could become coalition partners.Markus Söder: The Bavarian OptionMr. Söder, the governor of Bavaria, is still considered a potential chancellor candidate in next year's election, although he has said he would prefer to stay in his state.After swinging to the right ahead of the 2018 state election in Bavaria, which he won, Mr. Söder has since taken on more pro-environment positions in his home state. Still, many see Mr. Söder as untried and lacking the experience to take on the country's top office.Formerly a fierce critic of Ms. Merkel, he has recently come out in support of her serving out her term.""I believe that breaking with the chancellor is not right,"" he said on ARD public broadcaster on Sunday, making clear the Bavarians will have a say in who runs for the chancellery.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at a reception of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Vorpommern-Greifswald in Greifswald in February.

849,890586981.xml,"      When the euro was born more than a decade ago, its creators argued that, as a common currency, it would bring strength and efficiency to Europe's economy. They surely didn't imagine that in the summer of 2011, it would do exactly the opposite.   A debt crisis first hit Europe in 2009, but that was only the beginning. This summer, the crisis grew to threaten the euro itself -- requiring the European Central Bank and governments to take unusual actions, including complicated bailouts and strict austerity measures.    Many of those actions did not sit well with citizens in the countries most affected, including Greece, Spain and Italy, and they took to the streets to let their opinions be known.

439,2282942252.xml,"FORST, Germany -- On the eastern edge of former Communist Germany, Dr. Thomas Jähn sees his patients five days a week. Some come to talk about their own health, others about the health of German democracy.About the local post office that just closed down. About the train line to Berlin that was promised but never built. About the coal production that is being phased out nearby and the thousands of jobs going with it.And about the lingering inequality between East and West three decades after the Berlin Wall fell.""They ask me, 'What's the point of voting when no one listens?' "" Dr. Jähn said before two closely watched eastern state elections this Sunday.Dr. Jähn, a family doctor in the small town of Forst, has been listening. Three months ago, he was elected to the town council for the far-right Alternative for Germany, alongside other respected figures in the community: a fireman, a plumber, a businessman and a soccer coach.That, in a nutshell, says Mayor Simone Taubenek, an independent, helps explain why the far right is so strong here: ""When the local doctor votes far right, it gives them legitimacy.""The far right may be flatlining, even borderline imploding, in Western Germany, trailing far behind Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and garnering less than half the support of the resurgent liberal Greens.But here, in the former Communist East, the Alternative for Germany, known by its German abbreviation AfD, is competing to be No. 1. A broad-based political force embedded at the grass-roots level, the party has become Exhibit A for a Germany that is more divided between East and West than at any point since reunification.That is one reason Sunday's state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg, coming 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have taken on an outsized symbolic importance.""It's a moment to take stock of reunification -- and of the strength of the far right,"" said Marcus Böick, a historian specialized in recent East German history.The two things have become inextricably linked, he said.The AfD has both tapped into the East-West division and exacerbated it by actively styling itself as an Eastern identity party. ""The East Rises Up!"" reads one of its campaign posters. ""Complete the revolution,"" another urges, a reference to the 1989 protests that brought down Communism and ushered in democracy and capitalism.""East German identity is part of the AfD's identity,"" said Norbert Kleinwächter, a national lawmaker for the AfD, who was campaigning in Forst one recent evening. ""There are Westerners and Easterners -- their experiences are very different.""Such messaging plays well at a time when voters in the former East have started telling pollsters that they identify as ""East German,"" something few did even under Communism. Over 70 percent of West Germans simply feel ""German,"" a recent survey by the Allensbach institute showed. In the East, that was true of only 44 percent.In Brandenburg and Saxony, the two states that vote this weekend, polls give the AfD up to 25 percent support. On Sunday, when voters elect a new regional legislature, the party could come first in one or both regions.In Forst, a once prosperous textile hub on the Polish border that lost thousands of jobs and half its population after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the AfD is already No. 1.One in three voters among the 18,500 inhabitants support the far right. The party has the biggest group in the town council.Ask Ulrich Mäbert, a local businessman, why he votes for the AfD after years of casting his ballot for Ms. Merkel's conservatives, her social democratic coalition partner and, once, for the Greens, and he points to acres of undeveloped land on the town's edge.""This is our industrial area,"" he said bitterly, his arm sweeping across the empty fields. The investment and jobs successive politicians promised never materialized, he said.In downtown Forst, shuttered factories and smoke stacks still dot the sky line. Trees grow out of abandoned villas. A graffitied slogan sums up the mood: ""Nobody can help.""Mr. Mäbert remembers the euphoria 30 years ago, when Ms. Merkel's one-time mentor and predecessor, Helmut Kohl, promised Easterners an economic miracle in a unified Germany.""In those days the election posters promised us 'Blooming landscapes,' "" Mr. Mäbert recalled. ""And we all believed it.""No one believes it now, he said.Things have gradually improved since the 1990s, when in the space of a few years the entire textile industry collapsed and unemployment surged.Today government money has improved roads and public buildings in the town. Forst has a recently renovated swimming pool with a 10-meter diving board. Half of the town's inhabitants live in houses of their own.Now that the government has decided to phase out coal production, billions more will flow in to help compensate for the job losses.But, as Carola Friebel, a local shop owner, put it: ""People don't want money, they want a future.""Ms. Friebel does not vote for the AfD but she has friends who do. Her stationery shop is one of the few remaining retailers. ""Tourists sometimes come in and ask me where the town center is,"" Ms. Friebel said. ""I tell them, 'You're standing right in the middle of it.""'But you would not know.The shoe shop closed, so did a number of boutiques, a supermarket and then, in June, the post office. A proud 19th-century building, it gained particular significance under Communism, when older residents recall going there to place phone calls or pick up packages from relatives in the West.""It's all gone,"" said Ms. Friebel.So have her children, who like many others have grown up and moved away to find work.Thirty-five percent of the population is over 60, said Ms. Taubenek, the mayor. ""I've lost two generations,"" she said.But economics is only one reason the people of Forst are rebelling against traditional parties on the left and right.""There is a sense that things are decided over your head, that you have no say in anything,"" said Diana Sonntag, a restaurant owner and mother of six.""We in the East are familiar with that,"" she said. ""We've been there before.""Under Communism, the party called the shots, she said. Now the market does. ""I've come to realize that everything they taught us about capitalism all those years ago is true,"" Ms. Sonntag said. ""Politics is just for show. Money rules.""The disruption brought by capitalism is only the latest way the people of Forst have had their lives upended over the past century.Nestled on the banks of the Neisse River, the town was shot to rubble by the advancing Russian Army in 1945.Under Communism, local businesses were expropriated. Then, with the arrival of capitalism, unemployment surged and overnight, people's résumés became meaningless.Margrid Schmidt, a 76-year-old retired nursery teacher who attended an AfD rally last week, remembers being told after reunification that her degree no longer qualified her to work in a nursery.She had to retrain. ""One hundred hours to learn how to do the job I had done for 20 years,"" Ms. Schmidt said.The sense of injustice runs deep. And with the arrival of over a million migrants in Germany in 2015, it deepened again.Although Forst has few migrants, many complain that the government is treating foreigners more generously than struggling Germans.""My parents were around 50 when the wall fell,"" said Mario Fitzke, a local car mechanic. ""They had such high hopes and were bitterly disappointed and humiliated. And then you see what the refugees get -- all the things that we didn't get. That makes you angry.""""No one should be surprised at the results of the AfD,"" he said.Jörg Rakete, a social democrat who is mayor of a nearby village, said traditional parties needed to show humility. ""We are the ones who left this vacuum.""In his village, four in 10 people vote for the AfD. Calling them extremists is not helpful, he said. ""On the state and national level they are extremists,"" he said. ""On the local level, they are often citizens who no longer feel represented.""Credit: By KATRIN BENNHOLD; Christopher F.

Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister and the Social Democrats’ candidate for chancellor, campaigns in Leipzig on Sept. 5, 2021. By making an asset out of what has long been the Social Democrats’ main liability — co-governing as junior partners of Angela Merkel’s conservatives — Scholz has a fair shot at being Germany’s next chancellor. (Gordon Welters/The New York Times)..


BERLIN — When Olaf Scholz asked his fellow Social Democrats to nominate him as their candidate for chancellor, some inside his own camp publicly wondered if the party should bother fielding a candidate at all.
Germany’s oldest party was not just trailing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives but had slipped into third place behind the Greens with a humiliating 14% in the polls. As recently as June, the German media was framing the contest to succeed Merkel as a two-way race between her conservatives and the ascendant Green Party.
But with the Sept. 26 national elections fast approaching, Scholz and his once-moribund party have unexpectedly become the favorites to lead the next government in Europe’s biggest democracy.
“It’s really touching to see how many citizens trust me to be the next chancellor,” a beaming Scholz told hundreds of supporters at a recent campaign event in Berlin as he stood in front of a giant screen proclaiming, “Scholz will tackle it.”
Ten months after Joe Biden won the U.S. presidency for the Democrats, there is a real chance that Germany will be led by a center-left chancellor for the first time in 16 years. Not since the second term of former President Bill Clinton have both the White House and the German chancellery been in the hands of center-left leaders.
“The atmosphere is just amazing right now; we’re almost in disbelief,” said Annika Klose, who is a Social Democrat candidate for parliament and watched Scholz speak. “Since I joined the party in 2011, every election result was worse than the last.”
It is not that Germans have suddenly shifted left. Scholz, who has served as Merkel’s finance minister and vice chancellor for the past four years, is in many ways more associated with the conservative-led coalition government than his own party. Two years ago, he lost the party’s leadership contest to a leftist duo, which attacked him for his moderate centrism.
But Scholz has managed to turn what has long been the main liability for his party — co-governing as junior partners of Merkel’s conservatives — into his main asset: In an election with no incumbent, he has styled himself as the incumbent — or as the closest thing there is to Merkel.
“Germans aren’t a very change-friendly people, and the departure of Angela Merkel is basically enough change for them,” said Christiane Hoffmann, a prominent political observer and journalist. “They’re most likely to trust the candidate who promises that the transition is as easy as possible.”
With 25% in recent polls, Scholz’s Social Democrats have overtaken the Greens, now lagging at 17%, and the conservatives at barely over 20%. But political analysts point out that this would hardly constitute a convincing victory.
“No one has ever become chancellor since 1949 with so little trust,” said Manfred Güllner, head of the Forsa polling institute, referring to the founding year of the Federal Republic of Germany after World War II.
“German voters are quite unsettled,” Güllner added. “After 16 years of a Merkel chancellorship that provided a certain sense of stability, we’re in a place we’ve never been before.”
On the campaign trail, Scholz has spoken admiringly of the current chancellor. A slickly produced TV ad by the party shows him walking in front of a projected image of Merkel.
He has been photographed making the chancellor’s hallmark diamond-shaped hand gesture — the “Merkel rhombus” — and used the female form of the German word for chancellor on a campaign poster to convince Germans that he could continue Merkel’s work even though he is a man.
The symbolism is not subtle, but it is working — so well, in fact, that the chancellor herself has felt compelled to push back on it — most recently in what might be her last speech in the Bundestag.
Güllner, the pollster, said at least part of the recent surge in support for the Social Democrats comes from Merkel voters who are not happy with her party’s candidate, Armin Laschet, a conservative state governor who has repeatedly fumbled on the campaign trail.
“There is no real Scholz enthusiasm in Germany,” said Hoffmann. “His success is due primarily to the weakness of the other candidates.”
Unlike his rivals, Scholz has not put a foot wrong in the campaign. He takes few risks and is controlled to the point that Germans have dubbed him the “Scholz-o-mat” — or “Scholz machine.”
Sticking to his message of stability has also made it harder for his opponents to attack him on past blunders, although some have tried. As mayor of Hamburg, he took private meetings with a banker seeking a million euro tax deferment, an episode that has become part of a state investigation, and it was on his watch as finance minister that the fraudulent German fintech company Wirecard imploded.
But this has barely surfaced in the campaign. Instead, Scholz’s popularity has continued to rise.

Scholz was a socialist in the 1970s who gradually mellowed into a post-ideological centrist. First defending workers as a labor lawyer, then defending painful labor market reforms and now co-governing with a conservative chancellor, his journey in many ways tracks that of his party.
In its 158-year-history, the Social Democrats have been a formidable political force, fighting for workers’ rights, battling fascism and helping to shape Germany’s postwar welfare state. But after serving three terms as junior partners to Merkel, the party’s vote share had halved.
Gerhard Schröder, the last Social Democrat to become chancellor, won 39% of the vote in 2002. In 2005, when the Social Democrats entered their first coalition with Merkel, they were still winning 34% of votes; by 2017, that had shrunk to 20%.
But even as his party sank to a postwar low, Scholz became one of Germany’s most popular politicians.

It helped that as finance minister he controlled the government’s purse strings during the pandemic. After years of religiously sticking to Germany’s cherished balanced budget rule, he promised to bring out the “bazooka” to help businesses survive the pandemic, initially spending 353 billion euros ($417 billion) in recovery and assistance funds.
“Scholz has zero charisma, but he radiates stability — and he handed out the money in the economic crisis,” said Andrea Römmele, dean of the Berlin-based Hertie School of Governance.
If current polls hold, the Social Democrats will finish first but will need two other parties to form a governing coalition. One would almost certainly be the Greens. As for the other, Scholz has all but ruled out the far-left Left Party, which would leave either the conservatives or — more likely — the free-market Liberal Democrats.
Scholz has offered some ideas on how he would govern differently, but the changes are relatively modest and might be further watered down by his coalition partners, analysts predict.
He has tried to woo his party’s core working-class voters by using “Respect” as one of his main campaign slogans. In his stump speech, he emphasizes that people who earn as much as him should not get tax breaks. Instead, he wants to lower taxes for middle- and low-income earners and raise them modestly for those with incomes of more than 100,000 euros a year.
He promises to raise the minimum wage to 12 euros an hour (instead of the current 9.60 euros), build 400,000 homes a year (instead of the about 300,000 built in 2020) and pass a raft of climate measures, though without getting out of coal before 2038.

“We would not expect changes in taxes and spending to add up to a big additional fiscal stimulus,” wrote Holger Schmieding, chief economist for Berenberg Bank in a recent analysis of what a Scholz chancellorship would mean for financial markets. In a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats, he predicted, “the pragmatic Scholz himself would likely rein in the leftist inclinations” of his own party base.
Only the conservatives, desperately under pressure, have been arguing the opposite.
Even Merkel, who had said she wanted to stay out of the race, has recently felt compelled to distance herself from Scholz’s unabashed attempts to run as her clone.
There is “an enormous difference for the future of Germany between him and me,” Merkel said.

Yes, it's partially a byproduct of the tension between the administration's desire to hold illegal arrivals while their status is adjudicated and a court ruling that forbids holding children for more than 20 days. But the cruelty of separation was also deliberately chosen, in the hopes of reducing the number of families trying to make a dangerous border crossing by delivering the ones who get here into a child's nightmare and a parent's hell. It's only since the cruelty has become palpable instead of theoretical that the Trump team has fallen back on the claims that their hands are tied, that they don't want to do this, but law and order requires it, what can you do?Honesty is generally too much to expect from this administration, but this is a case where it would be useful for everyone if the Trump White House just admitted that this policy was conceived as a deterrent -- traumatizing a certain number of families in the hopes of bringing greater order to the border in the long run.That admission would get us closer to the hard problem in migration policy. Some harshness, some deterrence, really is unavoidable in any immigration system that doesn't simply dissolve borders. So policymakers are therefore obliged to choose tolerable cruelties over the intolerable one that we're witnessing in action right now.This dilemma was apparent (or should have been) in the Obama years, when a far more pro-immigration administration pursued sweeping amnesties, eventually by executive fiat. Liberals hailed those amnesties while paying less attention to the consequences of the Dreamer amnesty in particular: It created the impression that kids brought to the United States illegally would soon gain legal status, which in turn helped drive a  surge in children being sent north without their parents, overwhelming the Border Patrol and saddling the Obama White House with a problem that it ultimately passed along to President Trump.Now because Trump is hated and because he's added extra cruelties, the persistence of that problem -- the kids living in converted Walmarts or passed off to relatives or foster families and unaccounted for thereafter -- has suddenly become a source of outrage for liberals. So have the internal roundups carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which have likewise been dialed up under Trump, but which predated him and earned far less media attention.Some of this wider outrage is understandable, but it doesn't sufficiently reckon with the realities that forced even a liberal White House to run detention centers and pursue deportations. It's not just domestic politics and the (justifiable) fear of backlash; it's also that a more generous immigration policy can easily end up requiring more enforcement to prevent a snowballing effect -- because migrants are responsive to incentives established by receiving countries, not just conditions at home, and often (just ask Angela Merkel) the more you welcome the more will attempt to come.So even if you hope to move gradually toward open borders, as much of the Democratic Party seems to want, the slow pursuit of that utopia is still likely to force even Democratic politicians to conduct crackdowns in the year-to-year time being. If ICE were abolished tomorrow, President Kamala Harris would probably end up reinventing it.This means that even liberals have an interest in finding the least-cruel way of cracking down. My own view, largely unchanged since the days when Mitt Romney was hooted at (including by a then pro-amnesty Donald Trump!) for mentioning ""self-deportation,"" is that workplace enforcement is that less-cruel way. Mandate some version of the E-Verify program, make it harder to hire illegal immigrants, and somewhat more people would leave voluntarily and somewhat fewer would arrive illegally in the first place, reducing the need for ICE raids and the incentives for sudden border surges.E-Verify is harsh in its own way, since it locks many people who have been here a long time out of better-paying jobs. But with that harshness comes possible advantages for working-class Americans: E-Verify mandates ""lead to better labor market outcomes among workers likely to compete with unauthorized immigrants,"" a 2014 study found, with higher incomes for American-born Hispanics and recent-immigrant citizens.Right now neither party wants these mandates (E-Verify has fallen out of the proposed House immigration compromise), because both immigration activists and business interests hate them. But morally, E-Verify seems vastly preferable to the brutality of family separation and the harsher Obama-era measures that liberals have belatedly discovered. Trump is showing us what the greater cruelty looks like; that makes it a good time to choose the lesser one.I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

3209,1716963588.xml,"       IT IS RARE that a contemporary political state of affairs perfectly corresponds with a classical literary one - when the contours of the two align so entirely that not only does the latter help explain the former, but the new situation, with all its messy contingencies, seems to follow the carefully wrought logic of its aesthetic predecessor with such precision as to appear like a manifestation, or symptom, of it. Yet this is the case (I would argue) with the economic imbroglio between Germany and Greece. Economics, etymologically speaking, is a Greek invention. The word comes from the Greek oikos, which means ""house"" or ""dwelling."" At the basis of all economics is the practice of keeping one's house in order. This is what virtually all Greek drama is about: the attempt to manage domestic affairs, whether ""domestic"" be understood at the scale of one household, or of a family spanning several generations (the house of Oedipus or Atreus, for instance), or of the literal stones and mortar of a home - the attempt to quell its rebellions from within, fend off attacks from without, keep it self-contained, autonomous, intact. What lends the drama to the equation is the fact that this attempt invariably fails. Take Aeschylus' Oresteian trilogy. The patriarch Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, and the ensuing household struggle escalates into affairs of state and even conflict between gods. One oikos opens up into another - Greek oikoi are never closed. If it's not present violence blowing them wide open, it's past acts (as she approaches Agamemnon's house, Cassandra shrieks that its very walls are spilling dreadful histories, ""Remnants of bodies hacked/And murdered children's bones""), private intimacies unfolding into public knowledge - the whole process driven by an inexpungeable reserve of guilt. That guilt has its base in matters of the hearth - in other words, in economics - is echoed in the English ""guilt,"" a word that also retains links to gold. But it is German that is most attuned to this connection: In this language, the concepts of ""guilt"" and ""debt"" are served by the same word, Schuld. To be guilty, schuldig, is to be in debt, and vice versa. Joyce, a writer obsessed with economic processes, embeds this word in the central episode of ""Finnegans Wake,"" which turns on a blackmailer attempting to extract money from a patriarch entrusted with a city's cash box, who, harboring a guilty secret, wears ""billowing"" (or bill owing) clothes and an ""overgoat under his Schulder."" Kafka builds his entire oeuvre around Schuld. Not only does the word recur with astonishing frequency throughout his work, but he continually compresses the economic and moral aspects of the term. In his ""Letter to My Father,"" he pins his obsessive outpourings of shame (Schuldbewusstsein) to his monetary debt to his father, to whom he is able to feel grateful ""only as a beggar is."" In the English translation, one paragraph ends with two clauses: ""On every side I was to blame. I was in your debt."" But in the original, one clause alone suffices: ""Von allen Seiten her kam ich in Deine Schuld."" This echo in German of a Greek theme or relation is exemplary: Germany has always been particularly indebted to Greece. Indeed, from a cultural point of view, it could be argued that Germany more or less created itself as a modern state by plugging into vast reserves of Greekness. The poet Hölderlin reinvented his native Swabia by remolding it as mythical Hellenic Patmos. Heidegger elaborated his theories from the writings of Parmenides, Anaximander and Aristotle. Germany, in the best instances, has in return read Greece back to itself - as witnessed by the work of archaeologists such as Schliemann, who interpreted the findings at Troy and Mycenae. But the demands now being forced on Greece by the German government, the requisition of the former's civic cash box on bill-owing technicalities placed on its ""Schulder"" by far-from-trustworthy patriarchs, represent a worst instance, founded (it seems) on a willful misinterpretation of the nature of indebtedness and culpability. Greece is schuldig by definition, since it owes. But its debt, crippling though it is to the Hellenic household, is miniature compared with that of a nation that, within living memory, first (during occupation) plundered Greece's gold, then (after armistice) received monumental sums of unearned credit. The great lesson of Greek literature (as Oedipus learns to his cost) is simply: You are guilty. Before you've even done anything, guilt is the precondition of your being. The house of Germany is indebted, more than most; it takes no Cassandra to spot the murdered children's bones spilling from its walls. Its leaders, having profited from an open economy, are imposing upon Greece a spurious closed one tailored to suit their own ends. From a literary point of view, it must be concluded that Angela Merkel and her associates are bad readers. And this matters: Nations are symbolic constructs, mechanisms for regulating citizens' lives according to certain axes of meaning. So is democracy. In the Oresteian trilogy, the inexorable guilt (of Agamemnon, who sacrificed his daughter; of Clytemnestra, who murdered him in revenge; of Orestes, who killed her as a riposte to that; and so on, backward and forward for generations) gives rise to a series of claims and counterclaims that get resolved in what is effectively the West's first civic trial, presided over by Athena. The task, for her and the citizen-jury she appoints, is not to work out who is right (all parties' arguments are good), but rather to come up with an arrangement that can set all these contesting demands in some kind of balance that accommodates all sides. In so doing, she founds democracy. The groundbreaking event takes place in Athens. That the current Athenian parliament's own resolutions are being struck down by Berlin-mandated bureaucrats makes the Greek citizenry's long-running slogan ""Error 404 - Democracy Not Found"" even truer than they might realize.

2807,751954196.xml,"      BERLIN -- As anti-immigrant sentiment continues to sweep across Europe, generating a right-wing populist wave from the shores of the Mediterranean to the chilly reaches of Scandinavia, there is growing concern that such politics could take root here, too, in the fertile ground of financial uncertainty, rising anti-Muslim sentiment and a widening political vacuum left by the misfortunes of the once mighty Christian Democratic Union.   While the Swedes this week elected an anti-immigrant party to Parliament for the first time, and the French are busy repatriating Roma, Germans continue to debate a best-selling book blaming Muslim immigrants for ""dumbing down society"" and have heard a prominent conservative ally of the chancellor, Angela Merkel, suggest that Poland helped to instigate World War II.    ""Uncertainty is widespread over German society,"" said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. ""That is always a good base for those who tell the people all their problems can be solved by simple methods, by solutions that the others wouldn't dare to do, like throw out the foreigners.""    Since the end of World War II, German laws, political elites and social conventions have prevented right-wing parties from earning enough of a following to win seats in Parliament. The last time a  far-right party came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold was in the 1970s, experts said.   But the nation's political geography is being reshaped by strong gusts of discontent blowing in from different directions. Public resentments toward Europe were fanned by the German-led bailout of Greece, which Germans saw as paying for the profligacy and irresponsibility of others. At the same time, Germans, particularly younger generations, are feeling less constrained by their history and more comfortable in their national skin than at any time since World War II.   Into that environment came the book by the banker Thilo Sarrazin, ""Germany Does Away With Itself,"" which argues that the nation's generous social benefits have attracted large numbers of Muslim immigrants who have refused to integrate. The book does not address any of the endemic obstacles to integration, like discrimination in employment and mediocre schooling, but instead labels Muslim immigrants as genetically inferior.   The book and its popularity -- it has already sold about 600,000 copies in little more than a month -- represent the one issue that seems to have unified the European public: hostility to foreigners, especially Muslims. Recent polls here said that a right-leaning party could now receive up to 20 percent of the vote, which would put it in Parliament, according to reports in the German Press Agency.   ""It would be hard to cover all of this under one theme. Xenophobia? Not really. But it could turn into something like it,"" said Michael Naumann, editor of the monthly political magazine Cicero in Berlin, about the regional political developments. ""The search for scapegoats has started.""   Political experts say that in addition to anti-immigrant sentiments, the new right seems to be capitalizing on the sense among conservatives that Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats have abandoned them.    Several high-level C.D.U. officials have stepped down recently amid complaints the party has lost its way, and this month party members called for steering the platform to the right, which Mrs. Merkel rejected. One former member this month created a new party, ""The Freedom,"" based on an anti-immigrant, anti-European Union agenda, and leading party officials have acknowledged the need to improve the political dialogue in order to avoid fueling the right.   Erika Steinbach, the official who made the remarks about Poland -- and who leads a group representing ethnic Germans who were expelled from parts of Eastern Europe after the war -- quit the executive committee of the Christian Democrats after a decade of service, telling the German newspaper Die Welt, ""I represent conservatism there, but I feel more and more alone.""    The Christian Democrats, the dominant  political force here for decades, have historically absorbed conservative, even moderately right-wing supporters while presenting themselves as the guardian of Christian values. But lately the party has been accused by some of its members of being no different from the more liberal Social Democrats, and of enforcing a post-World War II political correctness that restricts debate about many issues -- nationalism, religion, minorities, but especially immigration.    Mrs. Merkel was criticized by some for condemning Mr. Sarrazin -- before she had even read the book. Under pressure, Mr. Sarrazin resigned from the board of the central bank, and his party, the Social Democrats, have begun proceedings to expel him.   To some observers, the political elites' stern treatment of these new ultraconservative voices only enhances their appeal. ""Steinbach is not very much liked, although she and Sarrazin are seen as people who are breaking up the politically correct tradition of dealing with the past,"" said Wolfgang Nowak, former senior adviser to the previous chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. ""As most do not share their ideas, they do not agree with the way they are silenced.""   The C.D.U. faces a difficult balancing act, trying to acknowledge public frustrations without lending legitimacy to xenophobic and racist views. To ignore the problems, some say, potentially opens the field to right-ring parties. ""This means that right-wing populist parties enter a vacuum that comes into being because many people get the feeling that politicians are not aware of their day-to-day lives,"" said Wolfgang Bosbach, a party member and deputy head of its bloc in Parliament.   At the moment, no one here is predicting the rise of a successful right-wing party, but that is because the main ingredient is missing: a charismatic leader to rally the public. With such a leader, and some financial support, the prospect could take on a life, political experts said.    But in Germany, where history still weighs heavily, who would dare?   ""It is too early to say how it will turn out,"" said Hans-Otto Brautigam, a former German ambassador and political independent. ""It may happen; I am worried. There are signals and signs but they are not yet clear. I still hope we can overcome these problems with solutions.""   Credit: MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Stefan Pauly contributed reporting.

Shopping for Christmas decorations in Milan, in December of 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic. The government’s pattern of red days and orange days, of openings and closings, of limits and exceptions on the number of guests, has confused many. (Alessandro Grassani/The New York Times)


ROME — This will be Rinaldo Verzeni’s first Christmas without his father.
In the nine months since Verzeni, 50, lost him to the coronavirus during Europe’s initial outbreak, he has grappled with grief and sought to sell the family grocery in their northern Italian town. He hasn’t had any takers.
At the end of an emotionally and economically draining year, Verzeni had looked forward to at least celebrating Christmas with his mother and sister and in-laws and nieces and nephews. For him, like for many Italians, the holiday meant the big family dinner and “being together.” But this year, he said, “something’s missing.”
Across Italy and beyond, people who have lost loved ones face an empty chair or an agonizing void this holiday season. That is hard enough. But a surge in infections, a new fast-spreading variant of the virus and mounting deaths have led authorities to shut down Christmas, too. For many, home for the holidays has taken on an ominous meaning: There is nowhere else to go.
In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has locked down London and prohibited guests from outside households as the new mutation runs rampant. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel urged the public to battle the virus by avoiding family visits and by making video calls like service members stationed abroad. Similar restrictions are in place across Europe.
The upending of holiday rituals has had a particularly disruptive effect in Italy, which has within it the Vatican, panettone and pandoro Christmas cakes, Neapolitan Nativity scenes and big family reunions over tortellini in broth, roasts and seafood pastas. Since at least October, the country has focused on what would be the government’s policy for the festive season with the obsession of a child counting down the days on a chocolate-filled Advent calendar.
The topic was inescapable, repeated in Parliament and on talk shows with the frequency of Christmas music on heavy rotation. Government ministers and virologists, celebrity entrepreneurs and influencers held forth on striking the right balance between health and mirth.
On the one hand, there was the need for human comfort. On the other, the grandparents at the table needed to be safeguarded in a country with so many intergenerational households. To lower the contagion rate for Christmas, the government broke the country into a color-coded patchwork with dangerous red regions and safer yellow ones.
To get the economy moving, it offered cash-back benefits for Italians shopping for Christmas gifts in stores. Then it changed the colors and rebuked the irresponsible shoppers for accelerating a second wave. The vaccine brought hope, the government said, but not a license to act recklessly.
The months of Christmas mania coincided with a dizzying increase in contagions that put a renewed burden on hospitals and catapulted Italy — after a brief summer hiatus — back to the ignoble position of deadliest country in Europe. Italy now has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths on the continent.
About 600 people die of the virus on average every day, more than any country other than the much larger United States and Brazil. Italy has lost more than 69,000 people to the virus and experienced more deaths generally than in any year since 1944, during World War II. With all the horrible news, the holiday talk started feeling unmoored from reality.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte himself started the holiday countdown in October, asking Italians to respect restrictions to enjoy “Christmas holidays with more serenity.” But by last Friday night, he had switched the talk from saving Christmas for Italians to saving Italians from Christmas.
In an almost apologetic speech to the nation, Conte introduced restrictions that limited movement and closed bars and restaurants from Dec. 24 to Jan. 6. In his trademark legalese, Conte called the measures “a point of balance between necessary restrictions and considerations of the social importance and ideals that this holiday has for the national community.”
The government’s complicated pattern of red days and orange days, of openings and closings through the New Year, of limits and exceptions on the number of guests, confused many.
But the main message got through.
“I’ll be home alone,” said Iolanda Di Maiuta, 73, who said that it would be her first Christmas away from her children and grandchildren since they had been born. She planned on making a bowl of fettuccine with ragù, a single serving of Christmas lamb, and watching some reality television. “Then,” she said, “when I am tired, I will just go to sleep.”
Many Romans checking out the Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square said that, as much as they would like to celebrate with their loved ones, they would not throw aside a year of sacrifice for one holiday lunch.
Pope Francis himself seemed fed up with all the hand-wringing about whether or not the big dinner would be permitted or whether children would find presents under the tree. He urged Roman Catholics this weekend to do something for the disadvantaged “instead of complaining in these difficult times about what the pandemic prevents us from doing.”
Even so, many sought a semblance of normalcy in this most abnormal of years. Panettone ads appeared on television, even if they now argued that the cake was as essential for a party of four as for 14.
Romans clogged the Via del Corso, the Italian capital’s main shopping artery, in the days before the holiday. As carolers sang English songs in Italian accents, Monica Baroni, 58, said she would set the Christmas table for five, including her husband, daughter, sister and mother, who is 100 years old.
“At that age, you have to consider what is the greatest evil,” she said, risking her health or leaving her alone. “This could be her last Christmas.”
For nearly a year now, the constant message hammered into Italy, the country with Europe’s largest population of seniors, is the danger the virus posed to the old. Conte’s first appeals for responsible behavior in March derived their emotional power from the idea of protecting grandparents. About 95% of Italians killed by the virus have been over the age of 60, and more than 85% were over 70.
That has periodically led politicians and doctors to float the idea of protectively setting the old apart so that the young could work and revive the economy. Dr. Luca Lorini, director of anesthesia and intensive care medicine at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, in northern Italy, the hardest-hit part of the country, proposed “a parallel life” between the working young and retired old in which they did not cross paths, a vision he said that any “normal person” looking at the mortality statistics would consider logical.
Lorini said that the governor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, called him in the fall and urged him to spread the word about his “great idea.” But many Italians who live in close contact with their grandparents say they consider such a measure unthinkable.

In the Pignasecca market in Naples, Ciro Amodeo, 17, paused from working in his grandfather’s fish shop to say that he could tell which customers were planning large get-togethers from the quantity of fish they bought for dinner. “Four sea basses,” he said, of one client. “A lot of shrimp, calamari and eel.”
His own family had scaled down Christmas dinner from the usual 15 guests to eight, but he said his parents, brothers and grandparents, ages 65 and 70, would cram around the same table, even though his grandfather also suffered from diabetes.
“What are you going to do, cancel Christmas dinner with your own family?” he asked, saying that even if he saw and worked side-by-side with his grandfather every day, “there is a different air on Christmas.”
It is exactly that air, though, that terrifies public health leaders and political leaders. They have calculated that shutting down is worth preventing more misery, even if it means depriving Italians of a precious day with their sometimes now diminished families.
That includes Verzeni. With his father, Dante, 78, gone, he said he was still unsure whether he should eat Christmas lunch with his mother in her apartment above the store in their town, Chignolo D’Isola.

Monica Mazzoleni, whose mother died of the virus at the hospital where she works as a secretary, decided with her father to spend Christmas Day away from the family table, avoiding the empty chair where her mother would sit year after year after year. Instead, they had intended to go to a restaurant near the northern city of Calusco d’Adda.
“We wanted to get away,” she said. But even those plans had to be canceled when the government closed all the restaurants. “There will be no Christmas for us,” she said.

1647,1799321370.xml,"       Hamburg, Germany -- I WAS born in 1973, the year Britain entered the European Economic Community. And like Britain, I have always been skeptical about the quasi-religious, ever-closer-union ideology that gripped so many proponents of the European Union, especially the anxious old men of my parents' generation, who swore that the only alternative to unification was a relapse into nationalism. And now this. Just as Europeans of my generation were being relieved of those anxious old men, another type stepped onstage: the angry old men. These politicians -- men and women, to be sure -- are young enough not to have experienced world war, but they are old enough to idealize the pre-1989 era and a simpler, pre-globalization world. At the same time, they are obviously too sclerotic to imagine how democratic institutions can adjust to the new realities. With their aggressive posturing, these Nigel Farages, Marine Le Pens, Geert Wilderses and Donald J. Trumps are driving the debate -- and possibly driving the West off a cliff. ""It's a victory for ordinary, decent people who have taken on the establishment,"" declared Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party. Rubbish. It was a victory for people who have neither the guts nor the imagination to take on the downsides of globalization. Yes, globalization and Europeanization have taken their tolls, both on traditional forms of democracy and on traditional job security. But instead of tackling these problems, the Farages of the world have started the next ideological war. There was a time when I thought the pro-European ideologues were the ones who were out of touch. I remember, not too long ago, watching one of them in full flight. It was Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, giving a speech at a German university. He started by asking the students in the lecture hall to imagine how many of them would actually be sitting there if this were the year 1945. About half of you would be dead, Mr. Schulz said, as his index finger drew a line across our heads, and many others would be crippled and wounded. Wow, I thought, what a splendid opening for a debate on the shortcomings of the European Union. Even though Europeans of my age do believe in Europe, the righteous theatrics of the integrationists were hard to endure. But now our future is in danger of being taken away by the other extreme, by the maniacs of disintegration. A YouGov poll conducted in the run-up to the British referendum showed that the vote for Brexit was very much one of the old against the young. The older the voter, the more he or she was inclined to leave. Some 64 percent of the age group from 18 to 24 said they would vote for Remain; just 35 percent of those between 50 and 64 wanted to stay. We -- the young, optimistic millions across Europe -- cannot lose the West to Mr. Farage and his ilk, to demagogues who have actually much more in common with the scapegoating culture of the Arab world they so despise than with the enlightened, rational tradition of Europe. We can still repair the damage done to democracy in our rush to move beyond national borders by admitting to the problems. If, for instance, European internal migrants really have lowered the wages in Britain, this is a serious problem. But it can be dealt with through, say, stricter control of the labor market -- not abandonment of the entire framework for European cooperation. Instead, migrants and refugees have become the vessel for the charge that the mighty at the top have unleashed a form of uncontrolled globalization whose effects will hit the people at the bottom hardest. Predictably, the German chancellor Angela Merkel's welcome-mat policy to refugees, and her insistence that Europe follow her lead, will be blamed for much of the momentum behind the Leave vote. And that's fair. As principally right as her message was, the chancellor did little to correct the impression that Europe was suddenly welcoming everyone, and that elites like her didn't understand the consequences of their actions. Yet it is dangerously foolish to believe that, with or without Ms. Merkel's policies, Europe can somehow shut its doors and ignore the pressing weight of the developing world on its borders -- or that European countries are better positioned to respond individually, rather than as a unified whole. The British vote feels momentous, but we will most likely look back at it as merely the first in a series of fights for the soul of Europe. The outpouring of anger and anti-establishment aggression in Europe has only begun. The next countries where the political bulldozers see their chances to act out their long-kept lust for demolition are the Netherlands and France. We can no longer think of reconciliation between the opposing views of destruction and progress. The angry old men will not be mollified, their xenophobia cannot be controlled or channeled into constructive cooperation. We, the young, the future of Europe, must push back.

1209,1922260042.xml,"How did Donald Trump come to speak for Western civilization?This wasn't what his campaign promised. Candidate Trump put America First. He proposed a creative solution to the problem that has confronted every president since the collapse of the Soviet Union, namely that the United States lacks an adversary against which to define itself and orient its foreign policy. In place of a single enemy, Mr. Trump offered the world. He laid into everything and everyone from the Islamic State to China to NATO allies to immigrants, albeit with the notable exception of Russia.Six months into his presidency, America First nationalism has not gone away. But President Trump has increasingly organized his foreign policy around another principle, codified in his July 6 speech in Warsaw. No longer the aggrieved victim that he portrayed during the campaign, the United States has morphed into the proud leader of the West, embedded in a ""community of nations"" sharing a common ""way of life."" The outlines of a Trump doctrine are emerging: The president has pledged America to the ""defense of civilization itself.""Back home, the foreign policy commentariat glimpsed the maturation of a presidency. A foreign policy oriented around defending Western civilization may be uniquely capable of squaring the circle between Mr. Trump's base of voters and the national security grandees who formed the backbone of the Never Trumpers. The base hears blood-and-soil rootedness: ""the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are,"" as he intoned in Poland. The elites thank heavens that the president is talking about shared values and committing to global alliances.Indeed, Mr. Trump's is beginning to sound like a conventional foreign policy. Presidents throughout the 20th century identified America's vital interests with the survival and expansion of ""Western civilization,"" which they claimed were threatened by Soviet-backed Communism from the East and disorderly rogues to the South. As Dwight Eisenhower declared in 1959, the true purpose of NATO was to ""protect the spiritual foundations of Western civilization against every kind of ruthless aggression."" Mr. Trump is shaping up to be no less committed to defending the West -- a rallying cry particularly for neoconservatives, whom he increasingly resembles. It's no wonder he has changed American foreign policy in evolutionary more than revolutionary ways, where he has changed it at all.>Would President Trump maintain the global alliances the United States inherited from the Cold War? This was the acid test, and he has answered in the affirmative. In Warsaw, he explicitly endorsed NATO's collective defense commitment after months of bluster. His personal relations with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany seem destined to be frosty, but he cemented his Atlanticist turn while watching Bastille Day military parades with President Emmanuel Macron of France. Nor has the Trump administration relinquished any responsibility for upholding defense commitments in Asia. To the contrary, Mr. Trump has vowed to ""solve the problem"" of North Korea's nuclear threat with or without the help of China. The president may decry globalism, but he assigns the United States no less global a role than his predecessors.If anything, Mr. Trump's civilizational framework makes more sense of America's forever war in the Middle East than did Barack Obama's language of surgical strikes. As much as Mr. Obama liked to parse the verbiage and conduct of the ""war on terror,"" the fact remained that he prosecuted it aggressively and widened it geographically. Mr. Trump has largely continued these policies but suggested that America is in the Middle East to police enemies of civilization. ""Lawless savages,"" he calls the Islamic State, evoking the worldview of European imperialists and their American admirers like Theodore Roosevelt.One result was the most surprising action of Mr. Trump's presidency to date: his strike in April against a Syrian government airfield in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons on civilians. Centrists raved that Mr. Trump might at long last be enforcing universal norms of the so-called liberal international order. But the president implied something else in his public justification: retaliation for a ""very barbaric attack.""In the process, he established another attribute of those who act in the name of civilized humanity -- the right to decide, alone, who and what lies beyond the pale. In 2013, Mr. Obama declined to enforce his ""red line"" on chemical weapons after failing to gain approval from Congress or Britain's Parliament. Mr. Trump, by contrast, may have seen the very unpredictability (and dubious legality) of the strike as an opportunity to send a message to the world that he would act, and bomb, as he liked.The flip side of this fondness for civilized law and order is revealed when Mr. Trump extols the ""unbelievable job"" of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who has orchestrated the extrajudicial killing of thousands on the grounds of fighting a war on drugs. Certain nonwhite, non-Western strongmen, it seems, can be brought into the magic circle of civilization if they are stamping out savagery. In May, Mr. Trump took his first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia. In a red-carpeted Riyadh he found an ally against ""barbaric criminals,"" not to mention a lavish purchaser of American arms. In so doing, he joined a long line of presidents who backed third world autocrats as bastions of modernity and stability. This time the president dispenses with lip-service to democracy or human rights.America First nationalism isn't dead, though. It lingers in the background. The administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord was pure America First, replete with paeans to Pittsburgh over the center of French civilization. The president may yet mount a serious effort to restrict trade, despite a lull after he scuttled the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Nonetheless, ""civilization"" seems likely to continue to occupy the fore of foreign policy under the Trump administration. It may be the only doctrine able to reconcile Mr. Trump's material commitment to America's global primacy with his ideological aversion to liberal universalism.>All this makes President Trump something other than either the narrow realist that his critics fear or the passing oddity for which his critics hope. Like it or not, the emerging Trump doctrine has deep roots in American tradition. Six months in, the time has come for advocates of American world leadership to own up to a fact: Donald Trump is one of you.To be precise, Mr. Trump appears to be evolving into a kind of neoconservative. Before becoming associated with George W. Bush's ""freedom agenda,"" many neoconservatives reviled Soviet Communism but were less than enamored with the goal of exporting democracy and human rights. Scorning the flabby norms of the liberal international order, they placed their trust in the muscular assertion of American power, deeming it the real guarantor of their country's interests and the world's civilized values alike.Like earlier neocons, Mr. Trump looks at the world and sees unceasing threats that experts understate. In the 1970s, prominent neoconservatives formed a ""Team B"" to challenge the C.I.A.'s estimate of Soviet capabilities and reinvigorate the Cold War. Later, George W. Bush's administration created an intelligence unit that hyped the Iraqi threat. Mr. Trump, too, mistrusts professionals in the State Department, whose funding he seeks to slash, and in the intelligence agencies, whose honesty and competence he has impugned. Like neoconservatives, he glorifies martial values and seeks to build up the military. Unsurprisingly, this foreign policy has received recent praise from neoconservatives like Elliott Abrams, an erstwhile critic and former Bush and Reagan foreign policy staffer. The commentator Charles Krauthammer, a frequent Trump critic, conferred the gold standard on the Warsaw speech: ""Reaganesque.""Even so, one should not expect Mr. Trump simply to replicate the policies of neocons past. Under the banner of civilization, he gains the flexibility to cast Russia not only as an Eastern enemy but alternately as a Western ally, standing tall against terrorist barbarism and secular decadence. Such an image, promoted by President Vladimir Putin himself, has turned Russia into the north star of right-wing authoritarians on both sides of the Atlantic.But Trumpian civilization may be less accommodating of Iran, North Korea and, most important, China. These powers -- nonwhite, non-Christian -- are susceptible to being expelled from its ambit. It remains for the Trump administration to answer how far the blessings of civilization extend beyond what Stephen K. Bannon, a key Trump adviser, has called ""the Judeo-Christian West.""As for that West, Mr. Trump has taken up its mantle just as the West has recoiled from him. He is detested in Western Europe. A mere 11 percent of Germans have confidence in the American president to do the right thing in world affairs. Similarly rock-bottom ratings among the British, French and Spanish resemble the lows at the end of the Bush years -- even as majorities expect relations with the United States to stay about the same. The trouble, plainly, isn't what Mr. Trump has done; it is who he is. Hence the irony of Trump proclaiming, ""The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive."" He is the one who might yet shatter the bonds of identity that form the West's ""will.""Mr. Trump enjoys better prospects for defining the future of the American right. In policing threats to civilization, he may have stumbled upon a framework for a truly post-Cold War, right-wing foreign policy, in which the United States no longer promotes its political model against any rival. For all that's familiar about the defense of civilization, past presidents have linked that cause to the forward march of liberal democracy. In the 19th century, the United States appointed itself the guardian of the New World against the monarchical Old. In the 20th century, it led the Free World against the totalitarian netherworld. And in immediate decades after the Soviet collapse, American presidents were not about to abandon the formula that appeared to have won the Cold War.But when Mr. Bush waged a disastrous war in Iraq, he discredited his freedom agenda for a generation, and counting. By the Obama years, a growing segment of the right came to perceive radical Islamic terrorism, white demographic decline and cultural pluralism as threats to Western civilization -- and autocrats as its foremost defenders. Mr. Trump capitalized on this politics of civilization, and he is forging a foreign policy in its image.

513,1507956067.xml,"       MOSCOW --  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia signed a decree on Monday formally recognizing Crimea as a ""sovereign and independent state,"" laying the groundwork for annexation and defying the United States and Europe just hours after they imposed their first financial sanctions against Moscow since the crisis in Ukraine began. Mr. Putin issued his late-night decree after the region declared independence earlier in the day and asked Russia to annex it in keeping with the results of a referendum conducted Sunday under the watch of Russian troops. The Kremlin announced that Mr. Putin would address both houses of the Russian Parliament on Tuesday, when many expect him to endorse annexation. The moves indicated that Moscow remained undaunted by Western pressure in a clash of wills that has created the most profound rift in East-West relations since the end of the Cold War, and that threatens the redrawn borders established by the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Every time the United States and Europe have tried to draw a line in recent weeks, Mr. Putin has vaulted past it. The White House indicated that it had held back going after some in Mr. Putin's inner circle to have room for its next countermove. The decree signed on Monday effectively raised the ante on President Obama after he froze assets and banned travel for 11 Russian and Ukrainian figures, including Vladislav Surkov, a longtime adviser to Mr. Putin; Dmitri O. Rogozin, a deputy prime minister of Russia; and Valentina I. Matviyenko, a Putin ally and the chairwoman of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's Parliament. The European Union followed with sanctions against 21 Russian and Ukrainian figures.  The sweep of the sanctions was viewed as relatively modest, but Mr. Obama signaled he may go further by signing an executive order authorizing future action against Russia's arms industry and the wealthy business figures who support Mr. Putin's governing clique. ""We're making it clear that there are consequences for their actions,"" Mr. Obama said as he announced the sanctions. ""We'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world.""  In Simferopol, the Crimean capital, celebrations continued Monday, and officials declared it a day off from work as officials announced that 97 percent of voters in Sunday's referendum supported rejoining Russia. Legislators moved to complete the break from Ukraine, adopting a resolution declaring that the laws of Ukraine no longer applied to Crimea and that state funds and property in Crimea had been transferred to their new entity. Highlighting the tensions, the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev approved a presidential decree authorizing the call-up of 20,000 reservists, and another 20,000 for a newly formed national guard. The interim government also increased the military budget with an emergency allotment of about $680 million. Moscow moved to welcome back Crimea, which was part of Russia for much of the past few centuries, until the Kremlin transferred it to control of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1954; it remained under Ukraine when that became a separate country in 1991. Every faction in the Russian Duma submitted draft legislation on Monday officially reversing that 60-year-old decision. The consensus in Moscow was so strong that even the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union is deeply reviled in Russia, endorsed Crimea's move, telling the Interfax news agency that its independence ""should be welcomed and not met with the announcement of sanctions."" He added, ""If until now Crimea had been joined to Ukraine because of Soviet laws that were taken without asking the people, then now the people have decided to rectify this error."" The American sanctions targeted prominent Russian officials, but not those likely to have many overseas assets; the European list went after generally lower-level targets. As a result, the actions were met with derision and even mockery in Moscow. In one measure of the reaction, Russia's battered stock markets rose sharply at the end of the day. ""This is a big honor for me,"" said Mr. Surkov, once called the ""gray cardinal"" of the Kremlin and known as the architect of Mr. Putin's highly centralized political system. He told a Russian newspaper that he had no assets abroad: ""In the U.S., I'm interested in Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg and Jackson Pollock. I don't need a visa to access their work."" Mr. Rogozin, who oversees the defense industry, chided ""Comrade Obama"" in a Twitter message noting that those on the list did not have assets abroad. Andrey Klishas, a member of the Federation Council, told Interfax that the measures against him ""were no tragedy for me."" Yelena Mizulina, a member of the Duma, said in an email statement that she considered the sanctions ""a rude violation of my rights and freedoms as a citizen and a politician."" Others singled out by the United States on Monday were Sergei Glazyev, an economist who has been advising Mr. Putin on Ukraine, and Leonid Slutsky, another Duma member. Mr. Obama did not go after Mr. Putin or others in his inner circle. The United States issued sanctions against two Russian-supported figures who have taken power in Crimea: Sergei Aksyonov, the newly declared prime minister, and Vladimir Konstantinov, the speaker of its Parliament.  It also penalized Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and Moscow ally whose ouster amid pro-Western street protests last month led to the Russian invasion of Crimea, and Viktor Medvedchuk, the leader of a pro-Russia civil society group, Ukrainian Choice. The European list for sanctions included Mr. Aksyonov, Mr. Konstantinov, Mr. Klishas and Mr. Slutsky. Over all, the Europeans targeted 10 Russian politicians, seven pro-Russian Crimeans, three Russian military officers in Crimea and the former leader of Ukraine's Black Sea Fleet, who defected to Russia this month. But the Europeans declined to go after elite figures like Mr. Surkov and Mr. Rogozin out of reluctance to poke Mr. Putin too directly. Asked whether the European Union had failed to match tough words with strong actions, Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, told journalists: ""The U.S. is from Mars and Europe is from Venus. Get used to it."" He noted that ""Europe is closer and will therefore pay a bigger cost for sanctions against Russia."" He also pointed to Europe's collective decision-making process.  ""In the United States, one man takes a decision on the basis of an executive order,"" Mr. Sikorski said, ""whereas in Europe, for these measures to be legal, we need a consensus of 28 member states."" Diplomats said some European countries wanted to include as a sanctions target Dmitry K. Kiselyov, a Russian television anchor who warned during a broadcast of his country's ability to ""turn America into radioactive dust."" But his name was dropped amid objections from Finland and others that journalists should not be singled out, even those in state-controlled organizations. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said the sanctions were not imposed lightly. ""We wanted talks and a diplomatic solution, but the clear violation of international law yesterday with the so-called referendum meant we had to take this step, and I am glad that Europe showed such unity,"" she said. American officials made clear they will ratchet up the pressure if Mr. Putin does not back down. They went immediately back to the Situation Room after the announcement to begin work on a next round of sanctions that could come as early as this week. Mr. Obama's new executive order expanded the scope of his authority to target three groups: Russian government officials, the Russian arms industry and Russians who work on behalf of government officials, the latter called ""Russian government cronies"" by a senior American official. While targeting a limited number of individuals at first, administration officials said the scope of the new order was broader than any aimed at Moscow in decades. ""These are by far the most comprehensive sanctions applied to Russia since the end of the Cold War -- far and away so,"" said another senior official, who under the ground rules set by the administration was not identified. The bravado in Moscow struck some American officials as bluster masking real concern about the potential financial bite of future sanctions, and there is some evidence that Russians are anxiously pulling tens of billions of dollars out of American accounts. Nearly $105 billion was shifted out of Treasury custodial accounts by foreign central banks or other institutions in the week that ended last Wednesday, more than three times that of any other recent week. Mr. Obama held out hope that diplomacy may yet succeed, but he sent Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Eastern Europe to meet with nervous NATO allies like Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and reassure them of American resolve.

3671,521222321.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED TORONTO -- Despite President Obama's pitch at the summit meeting for developed nations here for continued stimulus measures to prevent another global economic downturn, the United States will go along with other leaders who are more concerned about rising debt and join in a commitment to cut their governments' deficits in half by 2013, administration officials said on Saturday.    That goal is the proposal of Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada and the host of the two-day Group of 20 summit of developed nations. Mr. Harper wanted it to be part of the communique on global economic policy that the group adopts before concluding on Sunday, and he had the support of European leaders, including David Cameron, the new prime minister of Britain, who has proposed the most ambitious austerity plan of spending cuts and tax increases in his country in a half-century. Mr. Cameron and Mr. Obama, in their first private meeting since Mr. Cameron took office, acknowledged their different approaches toward balancing the need to promote greater economic growth and job creation in the short term with the long-term desire to reduce national debts, which reached dangerous heights during the downturn. But they downplayed those differences.   Mr. Obama said the two leaders were bound to have different approaches given their country's separate budget outlooks; Britain's debt is bigger than that of the United States, measured against the size of their respective economies. ""But we are aiming at the same direction, which is long-term sustainable growth that puts people to work,"" Mr. Obama said.   Mr. Cameron added, ""Those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy which is absolutely vital to growth."" He joked that he could not afford to pay for the helicopter ride that Mr. Obama had given him Saturday from the isolated site of the Group of 8 talks to the subsequent G-20 session in Toronto.   The separate approaches represented by Mr. Obama and Mr. Cameron reflected the splintering that is occurring within the G-20 as the global economy recovers, if haltingly, amid some fears of another recession. In three previous summit meetings since the financial and economic crisis began in 2008, the Group of 20 has coordinated on stimulus measures, banking regulations and anti-protectionist measures.   The Obama administration did have allies at the summit in opposing rapid moves to withdraw governments' stimulus measures. The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega, told reporters that the debt-reduction targets could compromise economic growth and would be ""too draconian"" for certain countries to meet. ""It is clear that we need to cut, but at what speed?"" he asked. Japan has also taken a position more closely aligned with the United States'.    Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner emphasized the American position again Saturday as he arrived here for the beginning of the G-20 talks. Speaking to reporters, he said that for all the progress the G-20 countries had made since late 2008, ""the scars of this crisis are still with us.""   Trying to bridge the differences among leaders here, he said: ""Our challenge, as the G-20, is to act together to strengthen the prospects for growth. This will require different strategies in different countries. We are coming out of the crisis at different speeds.""   Mr. Obama came to the summit table this weekend with a strong hand to press his case to foreign leaders for tougher banking regulations, after Congress agreed to a far-reaching overhaul of the American regulatory system. But he was hindered in his effort to persuade other governments to keep stimulating their economies.   Even as Congress allowed Mr. Obama to pack the big victory on banking regulation as he left for the Group of 20 summit talks, the Senate separately dealt him a significant setback that no doubt resonated with the foreign leaders here pushing fiscal austerity: Democratic leaders shelved an economic stimulus package of aid for the long-term unemployed and financially squeezed states, along with assorted tax cuts.    The setback underscored the difficulty Mr. Obama has had in making the case for stimulus. At home as abroad, Mr. Obama is confronting the limits of the consensus that took hold after the economic crisis began in 2008, which favored bigger deficits to spur job creation. At stake, as the administration sees it, is continued global recovery or a relapse into another recession.    Yet even within Mr. Obama's administration there are fault lines on how much additional stimulus is desirable.   Some news reports in recent days suggested that Peter R. Orszag, the budget director who recently announced that he would be leaving in late July, was resigning partly out of frustration that he had lost the argument for deeper and quicker reductions in projected deficits. Advisers and associates of Mr. Orszag insist that is not so, however, and Mr. Orszag was moved to address the issue late Friday in his blog on the Web site of the Office of Management and Budget.   Saying that ""it was simply time for me to move on,"" Mr. Orszag recounted the deficit-reduction steps that Mr. Obama has proposed: a three-year freeze after this fiscal year for nonsecurity domestic appropriations, $1 trillion in reductions over the coming decade and a bipartisan fiscal commission -- a priority of Mr. Orszag's -- that will try to make recommendations, with a Dec. 1 target, for reducing the debt.    ""The president has made it clear to his economic team that he is seriously committed to tackling our fiscal problems,"" Mr. Orszag wrote.   Indeed, Mr. Orszag has complained to associates that the debate over job creation versus deficit reduction is a false one; the only disagreement is over timing. In advance of the G-20, Mr. Geithner, who is closer in his thinking to Mr. Orszag, and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council, and a proponent of more short-term stimulus measures, co-wrote an op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal to project a united front on the issue.   ""We must demonstrate a commitment to reducing long-term deficits, but not at the price of short-term growth,"" they wrote. ""Without growth now, deficits will rise further and undermine future growth.""   European countries generally are running annual deficits of about 6 percent of the size of their economies -- twice as large as the limit that the European Union tries to enforce. Even before Mr. Cameron took action in London, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, had begun turning from stimulus to immediate deficit reductions.   Mr. Harper of Canada on Friday praised Mr. Cameron for his austerity initiative, saying it was the sort of fiscal constraint the rest of the G-20 nations should adopt. On Saturday, an adviser said Mr. Harper was lobbying the other leaders to commit to fully implement ""existing"" stimulus plans -- suggesting no additional spending or tax cut measures -- and to cut their annual deficits in half by 2013 and put them on a downward trajectory after 2016.   That is a more ambitious and constrictive path than the one Mr. Obama has proposed as the goal of his fiscal commission. He has proposed that the United States cut its annual deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic product by fiscal year 2015.

736,1864898215.xml,"VALLETTA, Malta -- European Union leaders pledged on Friday to slow the movement of African migrants crossing the Mediterranean in a desperate and often deadly bid to escape war, chaos and poverty.A record 4,579 people died last year along the so-called Central Mediterranean route -- typically while trying to reach Italy from Libya. This year, as of Thursday, 254 people have perished along that route.""With hundreds having already lost their lives in 2017 and spring approaching, we are determined to take additional action to significantly reduce migratory flows along the Central Mediterranean route and break the business model of smugglers,"" the leaders said in a joint statement in Malta, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.The bloc's leaders met as anxieties mounted about President Trump's comments disparaging the European Union. France's president, François Hollande, said that Mr. Trump ""should not interfere in the life of the European Union,"" adding that he ""can have opinions, but it is up to Europe to decide how big it wants to be and how it wants to conduct itself.""Mr. Hollande acknowledged the tremendous uncertainty that Mr. Trump's off-the-cuff remarks and improvisational views had injected into international affairs.""Who knows what the president of the United States really wants?"" Mr. Hollande said. National leaders, he said, ""should think of their future as being first in the European Union,"" instead of focusing on their relations with the Trump administration. ""We must have a European conception of our future.""The leaders agreed on a plan that would increase support and training for Libya's Coast Guard, and give African countries more aid to discourage the paying of smugglers to undertake the perilous maritime journey.European leaders said their goal was to save lives and choke off the flow of profits to unscrupulous smugglers who have taken advantage of Africans' desperate circumstances, without regard to their safety or well-being.They stopped short of taking more severe actions -- like declaring Libya a ""safe third country,"" which would obviate the legal obligation to consider asylum claims from people who have reached Europe through Libya, or screening migrants and processing their asylum claims in centers based in North Africa.""Can refugees only come to us if they entrust their fate to smugglers, to traffickers? I must say no to that,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said at a news conference. She said the bloc should consider supporting countries like Ethiopia ""to set up humane possibilities for giving people shelter,"" so that those fleeing countries like Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan did not make their way farther north, or onward to Europe.Nonetheless, immigrant rights groups expressed concern on Friday that the latest plan would result in the warehousing of migrants in decrepit centers.""We believe that, given the current context, it is not appropriate to consider Libya a safe third country, nor to establish extraterritorial processing of asylum seekers in North Africa,"" the International Organization for Migration said in a statement. ""We urge a move away from migration management based on the automatic detention of refugees and migrants in inhumane conditions in Libya towards the creation of proper reception services.""Arjan Hehenkamp, a Doctors Without Borders official who returned to Amsterdam on Thursday after visiting migrants held in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, said in a statement that the European Union was ""delusional about just how dangerous the situation in Libya really is.""He added: ""The declaration does not refer to any alternatives for people who are unable to stay in Libya and would be at risk if they were returned home. The suggested ways of improving the situation in Libya for refugees and other migrants are dangerously lacking in detail.""He said his organization was treating about 500 people a week, at seven dangerously crowded detention centers in and around the capital, for respiratory tract infections, acute diarrhea, skin disease and urinary tract infections -- illnesses resulting from the unsafe conditions in the centers.A huge influx of migrants in 2015 has tested Europe's ability and willingness to absorb people fleeing desperation and has stirred a backlash in countries like France, Germany and the Netherlands -- all of which are scheduled to hold elections this year -- among people who fear that the migrants cannot assimilate and may intensify the threat of terrorism.Last year, the European Union reduced another major stream of migrants -- people entering Greece via Turkey, most of them by the Aegean Sea -- to a relative trickle by stopping the exodus of people from Greece through the Balkans and by offering the Turkish government various inducements.Turkey has taken an authoritarian turn and been destabilized by the longstanding civil war in neighboring Syria, but it has a relatively strong government. Libya, by contrast, is all but a failed state, with rival governments and Islamist and Tuareg insurgencies.And while the bulk of those fleeing for Europe through Turkey were Syrians escaping the persecution and sectarian violence of the civil war, those leaving through Libya are a more heterogeneous group, including many West Africans escaping privation, who may not qualify for asylum.""Not even Greece and Italy can effectively manage mass arrivals within their own borders, so I don't know how this is supposed to be done in even more volatile conditions like in Libya,"" Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Migration Policy Institute's European office in Brussels, said in an interview on Friday.""Unfortunately, E.U. leaders cannot afford to publicly acknowledge a blunt truth -- that Libya will not be able to do much of what is being asked of it,"" she said.Some European officials expressed anger on Friday that the European Union was not being more welcoming to migrants at a time when Mr. Trump is turning them away and planning a wall on the Mexico border.""Criticizing Trump's wall, but establishing barricades against refugees from Libya at the same time, is hypocritical,"" Sven Giegold, a German lawmaker at the European Parliament, said in a statement. ""In the battle for our core values, Europe weakens its own position towards the U.S. if it does not adhere to these values.""Credit: JAMES KANTER; Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Russell Goldman from New York.Migrants and Refugees Rescued Friday About 20 Miles Off Libya.

3768,1892560848.xml,"'I cannot take the other culture with a spoon and eat it and get it inside me.''We thought we were coming to a free country, and here is this guy telling us how we should be dressed.''I don't miss being in a place where everything is war.''True integration only comes when both sides are willing to move.'The storied city of Weimar, Germany (population 65,000), absorbed 900 refugees in a year. Our journalists spent months on the ground examining integration from all sides.--------The German woman, herself an immigrant from Ghana, jerked forward with such force her hoop earrings swung like pendulums. ""The whole thing is to have power over women,"" declared Mona Fofie, 24, speaking of the Muslim head covering called hijab.The Syrian man, one of 900 asylum-seekers welcomed in Weimar, Germany, was no less upset. ""Have you asked them?"" demanded Anas Alkarri, 28. ""I think you will find it is their choice to wear the hijab.""She pressed on: ""I have heard that women can't worship in the mosque. Is this true?""He scoffed: ""Of course they can worship in the mosque. This is a misconception. There is a separate section in the back for them.""The German woman stifled a gasp. ""A separate section? Oh my God.""So it went in a four-month cultural crash course pairing Weimar residents with refugees, and in informal interactions around the city and the rest of Germany, as roughly one million people arrived in galvanic waves from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. The rapid influx shook European social structures, accelerated a rise in right-wing nationalism and saddled social welfare systems with the complex challenge of absorbing so many desperate wanderers at once.----Germany led the way in numbers of refugees and in programs to support them, as Chancellor Angela Merkel called for constituents to open their communities and, not incidentally, provide work in a nation where 658,000 jobs went unfilled last year.The German government spent 14.5 billion euros -- about $15 billion -- on refugees in 2016, and nearly as much is earmarked for this year. About $1.5 billion of 2016's expenditures paid for reception centers, registration and housing during the asylum application process; $2.2 billion went to integration efforts like the cultural crash course run by the European Youth Education Center in Weimar.With the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party polling as the third-strongest ahead of federal elections in September, the nation's Interior Ministry released figures this week showing that the number of criminal suspects classified as immigrants had surged more than 50 percent. Nearly 175,000 newcomers to Germany were charged last year, according to the data, accounting for 8.6 percent of all crimes, up from 5.7 percent in 2015, increasing the pressure on Ms. Merkel's government to step up deportations of illegal or criminal immigrants.""Those who commit serious offenses here forfeit their right to stay here,"" warned Thomas de Maizière, the interior minister.In Weimar, a storied center of culture and politics that bridges the nation's old East-West divide, Ralf Kirsten, the police chief, said many of the crimes involving Muslim newcomers consisted of disputes among themselves and frustrations over living in communal housing, not attacks on Germans.The city settled the migrants with classic German efficiency and astonishing speed by all measurable criteria: They were housed, clothed and fed, the children enrolled in local schools and the adults in government-paid classes to learn the basics of the language, laws and customs.They had health care, first through a new refugee department in the city government and then, once they were granted official refugee status, through the social service channels used by all Germans. That status also meant their monthly stipends increased to [euro]409 ($434) from [euro]216 ($230) for single adults, with a young family of three receiving [euro]605 ($643).But on the person-to-person level where integration really happens, there are staggering cultural headwinds. On issues like gender, sexuality, religion in the public sphere and even the seemingly mundane matter of punctuality, the differences may take generations to overcome.A city of 65,000, Weimar sits in a region of gentle hills and poor but picturesque villages, the narrow Ilm River flowing through the shadows of old palaces and sprawling parks.Two of Germany's dominant literary figures, Goethe and Schiller, lived here. The Weimar Republic, which rose and fell between two world wars, was formed here, as was the influential 20th-century design movement Bauhaus. From September 2015 until February 2016, asylum-seekers like Anas arrived weekly by the busload. They crammed into a dormitory on Weimar's western edge and eventually fanned out to apartments of their own to start new chapters.Besides the housing and government-provided food or stipends, Weimar's refugees found a plethora of student, religious and social service groups providing help navigating the German bureaucracy and offering activities and events to pull them into the life of the city.Dozens of refugees we met said they had been largely welcomed -- or ignored -- though many recounted moments of public hostility and even physical aggression. As the months passed, we watched them wandering the cobbled streets of Weimar's old city, pushing bicycles, pausing at kebab shops, playing table soccer with shaggy university students.""I think this process of integration is going to be more difficult than people realize,"" Anas said one day. ""And I think it will come as a surprise to many of the Germans, but it is going to be just as hard for them as it is for us.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

1423,2447180804.xml,"The poisoning of Aleksei A. Navalny could be a chance for Berlin to take a tougher stance against Moscow. But experts remain skeptical.BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's bedside visit to Aleksei A. Navalny after he emerged from a coma while recovering from a poisoning was not a secret, her office insisted. Nor was it official.Ms. Merkel's meeting with Mr. Navalny, Russia's leading opposition figure, was a purely private affair, her spokesman said.Neither Mr. Navalny's full military police escort to the Charité hospital upon his arrival in Berlin by air ambulance in August nor the dispatching of a security detail that has watched over him ever since is any indication of official favor, Steffen Seibert, the chancellor's spokesman said.""From the first day, the German government has made it clear that Mr. Navalny was here in Germany on humanitarian reasons,"" Mr. Seibert said.But the public and official attention surrounding Mr. Navalny's arrival and treatment in Germany after his poisoning has raised this question: Will Berlin now take a tougher stance against Moscow amid ongoing opposition protests in Belarus and fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia?""Of course, one always thinks that a new low point in German-Russian relations has been reached, then it gets even worse, and the next thing happens,"" said Dr. Stefan Meister, head of the Heinrich Böll Foundation's South Caucasus Office.""With every point the pressure grows, also from the public, for the German government to harden its stance toward Russia.""Still, experts are skeptical that either Berlin or the European Union has the political will to take concrete action, or to unite split interests, that would send a clear message to Russia.Russia has maintained that it played no role in the poisoning of Mr. Navalny; last week the foreign ministry in Moscow accused Germany of dramatizing the episode. German and other European experts, though, say Mr. Navalny was attacked with a military-grade chemical from the Novichok group, a Soviet-designed chemical weapon.Use of the substance would be a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention to which Moscow is a signatory, raising the prospect that Germany could lead the European Union to enact painful sanctions against Moscow.The watchdog for that convention, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, is expected to release in the coming days the results of its own analysis of biomedical samples collected from Mr. Navalny by its team of experts, the agency said last week.But Mr. Meister said he does not see the E.U.'s 27 members finding a consensus to enact sanctions. That is especially so, he said, after the failure of the bloc last week to impose economic sanctions on the leader of Belarus, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, after the fraudulent election in that country, crackdown on opposition leaders, and beatings and arrests of peaceful protesters.""The political will to take a harder stance against Russia is absent,"" Mr. Meister said of the European Union.He added that Berlin's own policy toward Moscow remained ""stuck in its internal contradictions and compromises.""Nevertheless, over the past six years, since the Russians sent soldiers without insignia -- the so-called ""little green men"" -- into Crimea, Berlin's position toward Moscow has shifted gradually, said Gustav C. Gressel, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.The pro-Russia stance that for decades has been the trademark of the center-left Social Democrats -- currently junior partners in Ms. Merkel's governing coalition -- has been chipped away at by Moscow's increasingly bold steps toward Berlin. These include carrying out a cyberattack against the German Parliament in 2015, and the daylight murder of a former Chechen commander in a Berlin park last year.""All of those who call for appeasement, insisting that we have to respect Russia, are becoming less popular,"" Mr. Gressel said, and increasingly, it is the hard-liners against Russia who are being heard.That does not translate into immediate action on Germany's part, however. Early calls to cancel the nearly completed, $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have faded, and Ms. Merkel's government has insisted it will seek a European response to the poisoning.But from the outset Ms. Merkel has taken an unusually personal interest in Mr. Navalny's fate. She granted him swift entry to Germany even though most Russians are barred, given the threat of the coronavirus, and personally announced in notably harsh terms the discovery that Novichok had turned up in the tests on Mr. Navalny -- which the chancellor in an unusually sharp tone called a ""crime.""Speaking to reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France echoed the chancellor's demand for Russia to explain what had happened to Mr. Navalny before a meeting of the European Council, part of the European Union's executive arm, on Thursday and Friday. The poisoning has been added to that meeting's agenda.""This is very clearly a murder attempt carried out on Russian soil, against a Russian opposition leader with a chemical agent manipulated in Russia,"" Mr. Macron told the reporters, according to Reuters. ""It is therefore up to Russia to provide clarifications.""A European version of the United States's Magnitsky Act -- which sanctions those found to be in violation of human rights -- would give the bloc an additional tool to use against Moscow in Mr. Navalny's case. But even if Europe does pull together its own version, Mr. Meister expects that those affected would be limited largely to individuals who do not regularly conduct business outside of Russia.The bigger question, though, will be how Russia decides to treat Mr. Navalny once he returns home as he has said he plans to do, said Janis Kluge, an analyst for Eastern Europe with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.President Vladimir V. Putin has never publicly mentioned Mr. Navalny's name in 20 years of speeches and interviews. But Mr. Navalny has now met with the German chancellor, whether officially or otherwise, and his poisoning has become the focus of an investigation by an international institution to which Russia is a signatory member.""It's about how Moscow now deals with the case, much more than about Mr. Navalny himself,"" Mr. Kluge said. ""Russia could have at least launched an investigation into what happened to him, but the fact that they haven't done so yet shows how little Moscow really cares that Europe and Germany are shocked.""Aleksei A. Navalny has said he expects to return to Russia. (PHOTOGRAPH VIA AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE -- GETTY IMAGES)",2020-09-30
594,1528175094.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- President Obama, seeking to answer criticism that he has forsaken America's leadership role, plans to lay out a retooled foreign-policy agenda on Wednesday that could deepen the nation's involvement in Syria but would still steer clear of major military conflicts. In a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., Mr. Obama will seek, yet again, to articulate his view of the proper American response to a cascade of crises, from Syria's civil war to Russia's incursions in Ukraine, according to a senior administration official who is helping draft the speech. Sketching familiar arguments but on a broader canvas, Mr. Obama will emphasize his determination to chart a middle course between isolationism and military intervention. The United States, he said, should be at the fulcrum of efforts to curb aggression by Russia and China, though not at the price of ""fighting in eight or nine proxy wars."" ""It's a case for interventionism but not overreach,"" Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said in an interview. ""We are leading, we are the only country that leads, but that leadership has to be in service of an international system."" Mr. Obama, however, will emphasize Syria's growing status as a haven for terrorist groups, some of which are linked to Al Qaeda, officials said. That could open the door to greater American support for the rebels, including heavier weapons, though no decisions have been made. The president's speech will kick off an intense, administration-wide effort to counter critics who say the United States is lurching from crisis to crisis, without a grand plan for dealing with a treacherous world. While such critiques slight Mr. Obama's accomplishments, Mr. Rhodes said, he conceded the president had not put his priorities, from climate change to the nuclear talks with Iran, into a comprehensive framework. Mr. Obama plans to elaborate on his ideas during a trip to Europe in early June. Over the next few weeks, the White House will roll out issue-specific speeches from Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other senior officials. ""We understand that there are a lot of questions swirling around not just our foreign policy but America's role in the world,"" Mr. Rhodes said. ""People are seeing the trees, but we're not necessarily laying out the forest."" The trouble is, as Mr. Obama takes a stage where his predecessors have signaled new directions in foreign policy -- George W. Bush used a West Point speech in 2002 to revive the principle of pre-emptive military strikes -- his ideas are likely to have a familiar ring. In a speech on terrorism last year, Mr. Obama warned of an arc of Islamic extremism stretching from the Middle East to North Africa, which he said was the successor to the Al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan and Pakistan that was fought with troops and drones. The president's calibrated rationale for military intervention will draw on a speech he gave in 2011 justifying American backing for NATO airstrikes on Libya. And his broad definition of America's responsibilities as a global power will inevitably echo the principles he outlined in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009. Critics are also likely to argue that the president's words have not been backed up by actions. Administration officials, for example, have long promised to bolster support for the Syrian rebels. But they have so far refused to supply them with antiaircraft missiles because they fear that these weapons could fall into the hands of extremists. Mr. Obama's anguished response to Syria has hung over the White House and fueled critics who say the president's foreign policy is rudderless: He threatened, then pulled back on, a missile strike against Syria for its use of chemical weapons and resisted pleas for greater American involvement, even as the death toll rises above 160,000. ""I realized last night that the administration has no policy in Syria, has no strategy in Syria,"" Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said last week. He had just attended a White House wine-and-cheese reception to discuss foreign policy -- a gathering he described as ""very bizarre."" Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said he invited Mr. Corker and other senators to meet with him and Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, because these issues are going to loom large in coming weeks, and the administration wanted to consult Congress. ""I thought we had a good back-and-forth,"" he said. Mr. Obama's promise last year to overhaul the counterterrorism policy has been bogged down, officials say, in part because of the distraction of the surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. And the president's pivot to Asia has seemed more promise than reality, with negotiations for a trans-Pacific trade deal dragging on and the restoration of American military presence limited to announcements like a base-access deal in the Philippines. It was on Mr. Obama's trip to Asia last month that his frustrations with his critics boiled over. ""Why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after we've just gone through a decade of war at enormous cost to our troops and to our budget?"" he said in Manila. Asked in a news conference to describe his foreign-policy doctrine, he said, ""You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run."" But, the president added, the overriding objective is to avoid an error on the order of the Iraq war. While Mr. Obama will most likely shun such colloquialisms at West Point, the baseball analogy is an apt summary of his philosophy. In other conversations, aides say, the president has used a saltier variation of the common-sense saying, ""Don't do stupid stuff."" In Asia, however, Mr. Obama framed the debate over military intervention in a binary way that aides say does not reflect his views. They said he agreed with the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, who recently criticized those who say there are no options between doing nothing and putting boots on the ground. ""We believe there is an alternative approach,"" Mr. Rhodes said. To offer more than competent crisis management, Mr. Obama will also promote initiatives, like a global climate change treaty, as well as the Iranian nuclear negotiations -- long-shot diplomacy that could nevertheless be a legacy achievement for him. Mr. Obama will also argue he showed firm leadership in marshaling support to resist Russia's aggression toward Ukraine and in backing allies in territorial disputes with China. The president, Mr. Rhodes said, will draw a line from Russia to China, presenting the United States in both cases as the ultimate guarantor of an international order. Such coalition-building, however, does not have either the speed or satisfying clarity of military action. ""It's a long game,"" Mr. Rhodes said. ""It's not one that solves the problem yesterday.""

3435,2469702342.xml,"Stores and schools will be closed, and public and private meetings will be restricted over the holidays, in an effort to bring down coronavirus infections and deaths.BERLIN -- Germans will be forced into a strict lockdown over Christmas, after weeks of milder restrictions on public life failed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, leading to record numbers of new infections and deaths, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Sunday.Starting on Wednesday, nonessential stores, schools and hairdressers will be required to close, and companies will be encouraged to offer employees an extended holiday break or allow them to work from home. The number of people allowed to meet privately -- including over Christmas -- will also be further tightened. New Year's celebrations outdoors will be all but prohibited, with the sale of fireworks and gatherings in public both banned.""All of this will impact the holidays, we know that, but we have been forced to take action and that is what we are doing now,"" Ms. Merkel said at a news conference announcing the measures, which are to remain in place through Jan. 10.Germany earned widespread recognition for its success in halting the spread of the virus in the spring through an aggressive approach informed by science and carried out through contact tracing, early and aggressive testing and coordinated nationwide restrictions. But since then, the country has stumbled badly, allowing a false sense of complacency to set in. Leaders of Germany's 16 states -- responsible for implementing public health policy -- have also been resistant to following calls from the chancellor and medical experts for another lockdown this fall.In late September, Ms. Merkel warned that if Germany did not take more radical action, the numbers of new infections could rise to 19,000 per day. Roughly one month later, the chancellor's warning came to pass as the country experienced more than 21,500 new infections within a 24-hour period.Instead of falling in line with other European countries -- including Britain, France and Ireland -- that imposed hard restrictions as their numbers rose this fall, Germany's governors squabbled over how far regulations should be allowed to go. The result was a raft of more flexible, softer measures nationwide -- named ""lockdown light"" by the German news media -- that closed bars, restaurants, theaters and cinemas but allowed small groups of people to meet and left nonessential stores, schools and hotels all open.The aim had been to reduce social contacts by 75 percent, Ms. Merkel said when they were announced in late October. But with more and more people venturing out for Christmas shopping and people gathering at outdoor stands to buy things like the hot mulled wine that is a seasonal ritual, a reduction of only 40 percent was achieved, Ms. Merkel said on Sunday.""The 'lockdown light' had an effect, but it was not enough,"" Markus Söder, governor of Bavaria, said. ""The situation is out of control.""New infections and fatalities from the coronavirus have continued to climb in recent weeks, with outbreaks concentrated among older people, especially those living in nursing homes and other care facilities. Germany recorded 20,200 new infections on Sunday, an increase of more than 2,000 compared with the same day last week, according to data gathered by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's public health authority.The country has lost 21,787 people to the virus, and the number of people being treated in intensive care is increasing, the institute said in a brief published Saturday that warned that the rate of new infections remained dangerously high and posed a strain to the country's health system if not brought under control.""If we are not careful, Germany will become the problem child of Europe,"" Mr. Söder said.Last week Germany's National Academy of Sciences called for a ""decisive and united"" lockdown over the holidays. On Wednesday the chancellor made an unusually emotional plea to Germans to listen to the scientists. The normally reserved chancellor stressed her own training as a physicist as she called on people to reduce their social contacts before the holidays to protect older and more vulnerable members of society and their own families.""If we have too many contacts before Christmas and then later this becomes the last Christmas we celebrate with our grandparents, then we missed something,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""We would do well to really take seriously what scientists tell us.""As Germany is preparing to all but shut down, some other European countries are relaxing their own rules. France has lifted its curfew and reopened nonessential stores, Ireland has allowed restaurants, stores, hotels and bars to reopen and people to gather outdoors, and England is preparing to ease restrictions on private gatherings to allow people from as many as three households to mix from Dec. 23-27.Germans have grown increasingly critical of the government's handling of the pandemic, with demonstrations against the measures growing from several hundred to several thousand since late August. Protesters include a mix of people opposed to vaccinations, angry citizens and right-wing extremists. A demonstration planned for Saturday in Dresden by critics of the coronavirus measures was banned by the city authorities. They cited concerns for public health, a decision that was upheld by the country's highest court.Starting Wednesday, Germans will be allowed to celebrate only with people from two separate households, in groups of no more than than five people over the age of 14, in addition to children. From Dec. 24-26, people from up to four households, plus children, will be allowed to meet, although no exceptions will be made over the New Year's holiday.Businesses and freelancers affected by the restrictions will receive compensation from the government for up to 90 percent of fixed costs, or up to 500,000 euros, equivalent to $605,000, the country's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said on Sunday. ""There will be a very comprehensive package of economic and interim aid,"" estimated at 11 billion euros a month, he said.Forcing stores to shut their doors in the final weeks of the Christmas shopping season is a blow to many of the country's smaller and midsize businesses that have already struggled to recover from the more strict lockdown imposed earlier this year.""The faster we bring down the numbers of new infections, the faster our economy will be able to recover,"" said Peter Altmaier, Germany's economy minister, who called the new restrictions ""tough, but necessary.""Although a German company, BioNTech, along with American pharmaceutical company Pfizer, developed the first vaccine against the coronavirus to be approved in several countries, including Britain and the United States, Ms. Merkel said that Germany would wait for approval from European authorities before it would begin administering injections. The European Medicines Agency has said it expects to approve the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine by Dec. 29.A market in Berlin.

937,433774014.xml,"      Of all the measures of Germany's economic revival over the last two years, none may be more telling than this: there are 711,000 fewer people out of work in this country than in 2006, and 1.5 million fewer than in 2005, when unemployment reached a peak of more than 5 million. The German government released employment data for December on Thursday, surprising experts again with a larger-than-expected decrease in the number of unemployed --  78,000,  adjusting for seasonal variations. Economists had expected the number of people out of work to fall by 30,000.   It was the 21st consecutive month of falling numbers, and brought the jobless rate for December down to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent the month before, the lowest level since March 1993. ''This is the fastest decline in the history of the Federal Republic,'' Frank-Jurgen Weise, the chief of the Federal Labor Agency, said in Nuremberg, where the agency is based. Germany's labor market has benefited from a number of trends occurring around the same time, some more healthy than others. A buoyant global economy has created a ready market for exports. Demographics also play a role. Economists noted that with a low birth rate and an aging population, Germany has fewer working-age people to fill the jobs its reinvigorated economy is generating. Mr. Weise said he expected unemployment to fall further this year as more jobs are created. Other economists were more cautious, saying that the nation would face pressures including high oil prices, a rising currency  and a weaker American economy. Germany's banishment of double-digit unemployment has been a political coup for Chancellor Angela Merkel. But some analysts worry that all the positive economic news is starting to influence political debate in a way that could undo the hard-won gains in the job market. The Social Democratic Party, which governs Germany in coalition with Mrs. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, is calling for the adoption of a national minimum wage. The country is one of just a few  in Europe that do not have a national minimum. The Social Democrats have made the issue the centerpiece of their campaign in a state election this month in Hesse. Mrs. Merkel opposes a minimum wage on the ground that it could hurt job growth, but a majority of Germans support it, according to polls. Mrs. Merkel's vice chancellor, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a leading Social Democrat, said Germany should consider a minimum wage in the range of 7.20 euros ($10.62) to 7.50 euros ($11.06) an  hour. By comparison, the minimum wage in France has been set at 8.27 euros ($12.19) since mid-2006; in Britain, it  is $:5.52  ($10.89) an hour for workers 22 and older. Employer groups  in Germany uniformly oppose a set minimum, and some economists agree that it could discourage hiring. Germany, they say, has recaptured its competitiveness, in part by resisting pressure for big pay increases. ''The German labor market is working better because the unions have lost power,'' said Holger Schmieding, head of European economics at Bank of America in London. ''This is an attempt to correct that by having the government set wages in sectors where the unions are not strong enough to do it.'' Other economists said it was not a minimum wage itself, but the level at which it was set, that mattered. Bert Rurup, the chairman of a group of five economists known as the ''council of wise men'' who advise the government, said a minimum wage, at a moderate level, would not hamper employment. He pointed to a 2006 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which found that a wage of 4.50 euros an hour (now $6.63) would affect only 1 percent of full-time employees, and potentially even fewer if trainees were excluded. Some economists said it was inevitable that Germany would adopt a minimum wage, given that nearly three quarters of European Union members have one, as does the United States. ''The big question,'' said Martin W. Hufner, an independent economist, ''is will the unions be able to push it up to 7.50 euros, which would destroy jobs? Or will it end up at 6 or 6.50, which would be tolerable?''  Another big question is whether Germany will be able to sustain its employment momentum. In recent weeks, investment banks and academic institutions have trimmed their forecasts for German growth this year, with most now predicting less than 2 percent. ''Germany is in excellent shape domestically,'' Mr. Schmieding said. ''The bad news is that it is being hit by an awful series of shocks. It would be a success if we got half the employment gains we got in 2007.'' While Germany now exports much of its goods to fast-growing markets in Asia, Russia and the Middle East, economists say it will not be able to shrug off a faltering American economy. Nor will it escape the effects of the euro, which rose to a rate of $1.4744 to the dollar in New York late Thursday. ''Germany surprised most of the experts in 2007,'' Mr. Rurup said. ''But it did so largely on the strength of the external economy. We will see a weakening of that trend in 2008.''

2670,577503699.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- The market storm over the fate of the euro has calmed to prevailing winds, but there is considerable nervousness here over the economic health of Spain, the impact of austerity on long-term growth and continuing differences between France and Germany over the economic direction of the European Union.   Similar divisions were evident in the recent Group of 20 meeting, between a Europe bent on deficit reduction and a United States still promoting stimulus spending, a friction that analysts say contributed to a shaky week in world financial markets.   Both President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are weakened by the financial crisis and public unhappiness, and both are maneuvering for their economic conceptions of Europe. Mrs. Merkel is demanding stability, fiscal rigor and a European Central Bank that focuses on keeping inflation low, while Mr. Sarkozy favors looser discipline, with room for stimulus spending and more concentration on promoting economic growth.   To complicate matters further, they are trying to thrash this out within a new European Union structure that is still confused and inchoate.   Market and diplomatic concerns are compounded by the uneven pace at which the European Union moves, lurching from summit meeting to summit meeting to find one ad hoc patch after another, and the slowness of European officials to work out their new institutional arrangements after ratification of the Lisbon Treaty last December.   Under that treaty, the new European president of the council of national leaders, Herman Van Rompuy, an economist and former Belgian prime minister, has moved more quickly than others to establish a powerful staff. Given the urgency of the economic crisis and the need for decisions by national leaders, he has managed to ""presidentialize"" decision-making, undercutting the influence of the European Commission, national finance ministers and the Eurogroup led by Jean-Claude Juncker, which sets economic policy for countries using the euro currency.   While not able to impose his will on Mr. Sarkozy or Mrs. Merkel, who dislike each other, Mr. Van Rompuy has worked hard to be a discreet and calming intermediary, senior European officials say. Europe's institutional confusions have made the French-German relationship even more important, rather than less, these officials say.   Mr. Van Rompuy's negotiating skill has also overshadowed Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy, which has had little to offer in a crisis founded in the debts and budget deficits of governments in the 16-nation euro zone. Even worse, France and Germany have sent relatively weak commissioners to serve in Brussels, and Germany in particular has been adamant in refusing to cede any new economic powers to the commission. Mrs. Merkel also insisted that Mr. Van Rompuy, not Mr. Barroso, be put in charge of a task force to recommend euro-zone reforms.   At the same time, the new high representative for foreign and security policy, Catherine Ashton, has made barely a ripple. She has concentrated on replacing her staff and negotiating with the European Parliament and nations over the shape and personnel of the new External Action Service, a European Union diplomatic corps intended to supplement and coordinate, but not replace, national diplomats. The service, which could end up with about 5,000 diplomats, will incorporate current overseas representatives of the commission, who are maneuvering to keep their posts.   Mr. Barroso, however, has already created waves by appointing his former chief of staff, a fellow Portuguese, Joao Vale de Almeida, to the new European Embassy in Washington, one of the most prominent posts to be filled in addition to those in Moscow and Beijing, without consulting member states.   Ms. Ashton, too, is trying to manage the French-German gap, looking to the current French ambassador in Washington, Pierre Vimont, as the most likely executive director of the new service, with a German deputy, perhaps Helga-Maria Schmid, who runs the policy unit of the council's secretariat.    But while the Europeans are slowly constructing these new institutions and bureaucrats are struggling for dominance within them, the French-German divide remains deep, European and national diplomats say.   Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Merkel know they must cooperate if Europe is to function, and their staffs and ministries work hard to coordinate. Franco-German agreement is ""necessary but not sufficient,"" as Mr. Barroso said in an interview here.   At each crisis, usually after German hesitation, the two have found a compromise, as they did at the last summit meeting in mid-June. But both leaders are increasingly unpopular, with Mr. Sarkozy battling ministerial scandals and Mrs. Merkel just managing to force through her choice for the ceremonial German presidency.   The two leaders are pulled in different directions by their electorates. The Germans do not want to finance others in Europe and demand austerity, while the French are unhappy about pension reform and coming, if still vague, budget cuts.   ""They are patching things over,"" a senior European official said. ""They are coordinating, but out of necessity, so halfheartedly, not out of choice or conviction.""   In addition to their differences over growth policies, Mr. Sarkozy wants an ""economic government"" of the European Union to coordinate fiscal policies at the level of the 16 nations of the euro zone, the better to put pressure the European Central Bank to be more flexible on interest rates. Mrs. Merkel has accepted the French terminology of economic government but insists that it include all 27 members of the European Union, to water down French influence.    Mr. Sarkozy wants the economic government to have its own secretariat, which Mrs. Merkel has so far managed to reject, while the Germans want harsh sanctions, including the possibility of expulsion from the euro zone, against nations that flagrantly break the rules.   At base, Germany wants the rest of Europe to behave as it does -- pursuing policies of low inflation, nearly balanced budgets and export-led growth -- and sees no reason to change. But France says that without more German consumption to accompany greater austerity and competitiveness from others, trade imbalances within the euro zone will sink it.   In an article published this week in Le Monde, Hubert Vedrine, the former French foreign minister, wrote that the French-German relationship urgently needed a fresh, public debate to find a synthesis.  ""France and Germany rarely have the same initial positions on issues,"" he wrote. ""Now the disagreements are somehow many. But there is, yet, no alternative in Europe to the French-German entente.""   Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Angela Merkel of Germany Have Managed to Compromise Despite Their Differences.

746,2286177851.xml,"BEIJING -- China's leader, Xi Jinping, warned a gathering of senior Communist Party officials in January that the country faced a raft of urgent economic and political risks, and told them to be on guard especially for ""indolence, incompetence and becoming divorced from the public.""Now, after months of political tumult in Hong Kong, the warning seems prescient. Only it is Mr. Xi himself and his government facing criticism that they are mishandling China's biggest political crisis in years, one that he did not mention in his catalog of looming risks at the start of the year.And although few in Beijing would dare blame Mr. Xi openly for the government's handling of the turmoil, there is quiet grumbling that his imperious style and authoritarian concentration of power contributed to the government's misreading of the scope of discontent in Hong Kong, which is only growing.On Friday and Saturday the protests and clashes with the police continued in Hong Kong, even after the region's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, made a major concession days earlier by withdrawing a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, legislation that first incited the protests three months ago.The Communist Party's leadership -- and very likely Mr. Xi himself -- has been surprised by or oblivious to the depth of the animosity, which has driven hundreds of thousands into the streets of Hong Kong for the past three months. While it was the extradition bill that set off the protests, they are now sustained by broader grievances against the Chinese government and its efforts to impose greater control over the semiautonomous territory.Beijing has been slow to adapt to events, allowing Mrs. Lam to suspend the bill in June, for example, but refusing at the time to let her withdraw it completely. It was a partial concession that reflected the party's hard-line instincts under Mr. Xi and fueled even larger protests.As public anger in Hong Kong has climbed, the Chinese government's response has grown bombastic and now seems at times erratic.In July, at a meeting that has not been publicly disclosed, Mr. Xi met with other senior officials to discuss the protests. The range of options discussed is unclear, but the leaders agreed that the central government should not intervene forcefully, at least for now, several people familiar with the issue said in interviews in Hong Kong and Beijing.At that meeting, the officials concluded that the Hong Kong authorities and the local police could eventually restore order on their own, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.There are hints of divisions in the Chinese leadership and stirrings of discontent about Mr. Xi's policies.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and an expert on Chinese politics, said it appeared that there was debate during the annual informal leaders' retreat in Beidaihe, a seaside resort not far from Beijing.Some party leaders called for concessions, while others urged action to bring Hong Kong more directly under the mainland's control, he said. Mr. Cabestan said he believed that ""the Chinese leadership is divided on Hong Kong and how to solve the crisis.""Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said Mr. Xi's government had in effect adopted a strategy to procrastinate in the absence of any better ideas for resolving the crisis. ""It is not willing to intervene directly or to propose a solution,"" he said. ""The idea is to wait things out until there is a change.""The upshot is that instead of defusing or containing the crisis, Mr. Xi's government has helped to widen the political chasm between the central government and many of the seven million residents in a city that is an important hub of international trade and finance, critics say.Another sign of the disarray within the government was the reaction to Mrs. Lam's withdrawal of the bill. On Tuesday, officials in Beijing declared there could be no concessions to the protesters' demands. A day later, when Mrs. Lam pulled the bill back, she claimed to have Beijing's blessing to do so. The same officials were silent.On Friday, China's premier, Li Keqiang, said during a news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who was visiting China, that the government supported Hong Kong in ""halting the violence and disorder in accordance with the law.""Mr. Xi, who is 66 and in his seventh year of his now unlimited tenure as the country's paramount leader, has cast himself as an essential commander for a challenging time. He has been lionized in the state news media as no other Chinese leader has been since Mao.This has made political solutions to the Hong Kong situation harder to find, because even senior officials are reluctant to make the case for compromise or concessions for fear of contradicting or angering Mr. Xi, according to numerous officials and analysts in Hong Kong and Beijing.""Beijing has overreached, overestimating its capacity to control events and underestimating the complexity of Hong Kong,"" said Brian Fong Chi-hang, an associate professor at the Academy of Hong Kong Studies at the Education University of Hong Kong.The tumult in Hong Kong could pose a risk to Mr. Xi, especially if it exacerbates discontent and discord within the Chinese leadership over other issues.""I think the danger is not that his standing will collapse, but that there is a whole series of slowly unfolding trends that will gradually corrode his position,"" said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of ""Xi Jinping: The Backlash.""""Hong Kong is one, as the protests look set to carry on despite the concessions,"" Mr. McGregor said. ""The trade war is adding to the pain,"" he added, referring to the current standoff with the United States.Mr. Xi returned on Tuesday to the same venue as his speech in January -- the Communist Party's Central Party School -- and reprised the warnings he raised in January without suggesting they were in fact worsening.""Faced with the grim conditions and tasks of struggle looming down on us, we must be tough-boned, daring to go on the attack and daring to battle for victory,"" he said.While he warned of ""a whole range"" of internal and external threats -- economic, military and environmental -- he mentioned Hong Kong only once, and then only in passing.""By painting a dark picture of hostile foreign forces or even unrelenting internal challenges the Communist Party faces in retaining power, it helps justify his continuing strong hand,"" said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Some analysts see a parallel between Mr. Xi's handling of Hong Kong and the trade war with the United States, which, like the economy more broadly, seems to be the greatest worry for his government at the moment.In Hong Kong, Mr. Xi's government unwaveringly supported the extradition bill. And it stuck by that position, refusing to allow Mrs. Lam to withdraw it formally, even as the protesters' demands grew broader. Her pledge to withdraw it now has been dismissed as too little, too late.In the trade talks, China also balked at accepting President Trump's initial demands for concessions. When the two sides came close to an agreement in the spring, outlined in a 150-page document, Mr. Xi appeared to balk, scuttling the process.Now Mr. Xi faces an even bigger trade war, with much higher tariffs and greater tensions. The government appears to be hewing to a strategy of waiting out Mr. Trump, possibly through his 2020 re-election campaign, even as the dispute has become a drag on the economy.It remains unclear how Mr. Xi's government conveyed its approval for Mrs. Lam's decision -- or whether it did. Mrs. Lam's sudden shift evolved in a matter of days after last weekend's clashes between protesters and the police, several officials said.Mrs. Lam said the decision to withdraw the extradition bill was hers, but she also asserted that she had Beijing's full support for doing so, suggesting more coordination than either side has publicly acknowledged.The silence from officials and in the state news media about Mrs. Lam's concession suggested that if Mr. Xi's government did approve of the sudden shift, it wanted to stifle public discussion of it in the mainland.Mrs. Lam herself described the tightrope she must walk during recent remarks to a group of business leaders that were leaked and published by Reuters.""The political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is, the central people's government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited,"" she said.She also offered a candid assessment of Beijing's views, even if one she did not intend to make public. She said Beijing had no plan to send in the People's Liberation Army to restore order because ""they're just quite scared now.""""Because they know that the price would be too huge to pay,"" she went on. ""Maybe they don't care about Hong Kong, but they care about 'one country, two systems.' They care about the country's international profile. It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile.""Hong Kong's unique status, with its own laws and freedoms, has long created a political dilemma for China's leaders, especially for Mr. Xi, who has made China's rising economic and political might a central pillar of his public appeals.China's recovery of sovereignty over the former British colony is a matter of national pride that reversed a century and a half of colonial humiliation. But the mainland maintains what amounts to an international border with Hong Kong.The government's deepest fear now appears to be that the demands for greater political accountability and even universal suffrage heard on the streets in Hong Kong could spread like a contagion through the mainland. So far, there have been few signs of that.As the crisis has grown, the government has sent thousands of troops from the People's Armed Police to Shenzhen, the mainland city adjacent to Hong Kong, but the exercise was hastily organized and used an outdated plan drawn up after the protests in 2014, according to one official in Hong Kong.Beijing also stepped up its propaganda, launching an information -- and disinformation -- campaign against the protesters and opposition leaders in Hong Kong.Mr. Xi continues to barely mention Hong Kong. He has said nothing about the protests, even in his passing reference on Tuesday. He has not visited since 2017, when he marked the 20th anniversary of the handover from Britain.After the traditional August holiday break, Mr. Xi's public calendar of events has since betrayed no hint of political upheaval or threats to his standing. The media's portrayal of him, already verging on hagiography, has become even more fawning. State television and the party's newspapers now refer to him as ""the People's Leader,"" an honorific once bestowed only on Mao.""The People's Leader loves the people,"" The People's Daily wrote after Mr. Xi toured Gansu, a province in western China.Mr. Xi's calculation might be simply to remain patient, as he has been in the case of Mr. Trump's erratic shifts in the trade war. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Xi also gave a possible hint of the government's pragmatism.""On matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded,"" he said, ""but on matters of tactics there can be flexibility.""Credit: By STEVEN LEE MYERS, CHRIS BUCKLEY and KEITH BRADSHER; Javier C.

1154,434004661.xml,"      The titans of Wall Street no longer sit atop the magic mountain.   Not long ago, at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers held forth on the state of the global economy before mesmerized journalists and cowering subordinates while other Wall Street stars mingled after-hours with the likes of Claudia Schiffer, the German supermodel.   As business, government and nonprofit leaders trek up the peak originally made famous by Thomas Mann's novel, but now better known for the gabfest that begins Tuesday, star power is no longer in.   This year, politicians, not corporate titans, are poised to be the big draw, echoing the broader power shift away from the free market as one government after another tries to prop up its sinking economy.   This time, the prototype of the jet-setting ""Davos Man"" may well be Gordon Brown, the dour British prime minister who spent last week staving off another round of bank failures in London.   And with much of the financial system in Britain and the United States edging toward a government takeover, the 2009 agenda at Davos,  ""Shaping the Post-Crisis World,"" seems to have concentrated minds on the here and now more than past themes like climate change and globalization.   ""The pendulum has swung and power has moved back to governments,"" said Klaus Schwab, the German-born economics professor who founded the World Economic Forum in 1971 and has been its impresario ever since. ""This is the biggest economic crisis since Davos began.""   The crisis, to be sure, is hurting some more than others. While Davos will draw about 2,500 participants -- roughly the same as last year -- it looks as if there will be many fewer members of the tasseled-loafer set strutting down the resort's snowy streets.   The insurer American International Group, while still afloat, has dropped its top-tier sponsorship.   Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is sending his deputy. It looks as if Ms. Schiffer and Angelina Jolie, another celebrity from the glamour years of the boom, will also be absent.   Even Bono, the rock star and social activist who has attended for the last three years, has other commitments: he and his band, U2, are releasing a new album.   Coinciding with the Chinese New Year did not help either, Mr. Schwab acknowledged. But he says the absence of some Asian business executives will be made up for by the presence of Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister.   Lehman, once a top-tier corporate ""strategic partner"" to the tune of 500,000 Swiss francs a year, is bankrupt, of course, and Mr.  Fuld's invitation has disappeared with it. Even if he had wanted to come, Mr. Schwab crows, there is no room for has-beens at Davos.   Some invitees do not want to test Mr. Schwab's hospitality.   John A. Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, abruptly canceled after being pushed out on Thursday from a top job at Bank of America, which acquired Merrill last year. Mr. Thain, a Davos regular who once ran the New York Stock Exchange, was to have taken part in a panel on Jan. 31, ""The Bank of the Future.""   For those still in the club, the private evening galas -- as much a part of the Davos experience as the high-minded daytime discussions -- will also lack the panache of yesteryear.   Google, whose annual fete was known for vintage California champagne as well as tech glitterati, is toning down this year's festivities, as is Citigroup, which recently received a $45 billion bailout from Washington.   Citigroup, now scaling back to a smaller Citicorp, still plans to send five formal participants to the conference, like others in the strategic partners circle. But the company has sharply reduced the army of other executives and support staff that usually accompanies them.   Indeed, big banks and Wall Street firms have been busy checking with one another in recent weeks to gauge what is an appropriate level of hospitality and what might be considered excessive in today's bleak economic climate, according to one planner.   Of course, when it comes to economizing at Davos, everything is relative. At B B Heli in Zurich, which provides helicopter service to Davos, business is still strong, but more passengers are opting for a single-engine copter rather than the faster twin-engine model, says Marcus Baumann, the general manager. So instead of $8,500  for the 45-minute flight, the cost is a mere $4,250.     Burda, the German publisher of Focus magazine and other publications, is also adapting. Its star-studded nightcap has always been a big draw, with Naomi Campbell as Burda's special guest last year and Ms. Schiffer the year before that.   At the Burda party in 2007, journalists and corporate chieftains alike posed for pictures with the German supermodel as other awe-struck guests like Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, wandered nearby.   Mr. Dimon and Mr. Schwarzman will be in Davos this year, but Burda is not bringing the supermodels, showcasing instead its annual digital media conference called DLD.   ""People are reassessing what they do in Davos, and the organizers have encouraged sobriety and want to focus on the crisis,"" said Marcel Reichart, a managing director at Burda.   What about stars? Instead of Ms. Schiffer, he offered up Guido Westerwelle, a prominent German politician who leads the Free Democratic Party.   ""He might be a celebrity,"" Mr. Reichart said wanly, a trace of disappointment in his voice. ""This year the politicians are the real stars.""   To Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which does research for the richest industrial democracies, ""Davos is reflecting what's happened in real life: the main protagonists and the ones setting the agenda are the political leaders.""   Along with Gordon Brown and Wen Jiabao, other top political figures set to appear include Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. All together, the leaders of at least 40 countries will make it up the mountain, up from 27 last year and 20 in 2007.   President Obama is a little too busy to attend, however.   Lawrence H. Summers, director of the White House National Economic Council, and James L. Jones, the national security adviser, were originally supposed to attend, but withdrew late last week.   Instead, the headliner from the White House will be Valerie Jarrett, a top White House aide who is a longtime confidante of both Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle.    Besides the politicians, another group of unlikely stars this week will be the economic doomsayers who have now emerged as prophets, like Nouriel Roubini of New York University and Robert J. Shiller of Yale. The two men are discussion leaders for a dinner Friday night that will focus on ""The Power of Fear in Times of Uncertainty.""   For the Wall Streeters who are in attendance, talking with these two Cassandras may not be as much fun as chatting up Claudia, Angelina or Brad. But then again, it might finally help the World Economic Forum live up to its motto: Committed to Improving the State of the World.

2984,1810712490.xml,"       BERLIN -- The German government proposed a broad range of measures on Thursday to bolster security and combat terrorism, its strongest official response so far to two recent attacks by terrorists pledging loyalty to the Islamic State and a deadly shooting rampage in Munich. Many of the measures, which include closer monitoring of refugees and enhanced surveillance, seem likely to win legislative approval but prompted concerns in a country that is deeply protective of privacy and civil liberties. The package of proposals is the most comprehensive from the German government since Europe became a consistent target of terrorist attacks by the Islamic State, other radical groups and their followers. They were unveiled at a time when Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations that the welcome she gave last year to migrants streaming to the Continent from Syria and other nations in the Middle East has compromised security. The German plan, and the response to it, reflected a broader tension in the West over how to balance steps to combat terrorism against civil liberties and political realities amid a resurgence in populism, nationalism and anti-immigration sentiment. The proposals announced by the interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, call for hiring more federal police officers; making it a crime to express sympathy for terrorism; greater sharing of intelligence data across Europe; closer watching of the ""dark web,"" the part of the internet that is invisible to ordinary users; stripping dual citizens of their German citizenship if they fight for extremist groups; and making it easier to deport foreigners deemed to be dangerous. Strengthening the federal government's intelligence-gathering powers is particularly fraught for a country where the legacies of Nazi and Communist control have left a deep suspicion of centralized authority and official surveillance, and where the powers of the central government remain limited because of the history of totalitarian control. Ralf Stegner, a leading Social Democrat, said that the plan was the clear result of ""public pressure in the last few weeks,"" which made terrorism more a reality than an abstraction. In a phone interview, Mr. Stegner said his party supported hiring additional police officers, upgrading technology, investigating the dark web and improving cooperation with other European countries, but was more skeptical of a proposal by Mr. de Maizière to restrict certain rights of migrants whose asylum applications have been denied but who cannot easily be deported. Mr. Stegner noted that France -- despite a state of emergency in place since terrorist attacks in and around Paris last November -- has not managed to halt further attacks, and that ""the mood there, and the situation, are quite different"" from Germany. Last year, 1.1 million foreigners migrated to Germany -- a record -- and the country received 442,000 asylum applications. Ms. Merkel has insisted that Germany can successfully assimilate the newcomers, but the recent attacks have strained the coalition government she leads. With elections in two states in September and a national vote next year, Ms. Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats and their coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, worry that the populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party could make strong gains. In announcing the measures on Thursday, Mr. de Maizière emphasized that Germany ""must change"" in the face of new threats, by showing enhanced vigilance, deploying new technologies and even, in some cases, overriding strong post-World War II concerns about privacy. He said he wanted to install sophisticated video equipment in about 20 significant railroad stations, and to improve the sharing of surveillance footage among law enforcement agencies, adding that the shooting rampage in Munich, at a shopping mall, showed that public spaces were potential ""soft targets"" for terrorists. The Munich rampage, which killed nine people, was the work of a teenager, Ali Sonboly, who had been in psychiatric treatment and was fascinated by previous mass shootings. The pistol he used, a Glock 17, was a former theater weapon, apparently bought on the internet, that had been restored to be able to shoot live rounds. Mr. de Maizière proposed much tighter European regulations to register such weapon conversions and to crack down on internet arms sales. Similarly, his proposals to monitor newly arrived refugees and people susceptible to radicalization seemed aimed at preventing terrorist attacks like the two by Islamic State adherents last month. The first, on July 18, was carried out by a person identified only as a 17-year-old Afghan who was living with a foster family in Bavaria. He wounded four people on a train with an ax and a knife, and then attacked a woman walking her dog; he was later shot by the police. Six days later, in Germany's first Islamist suicide attack, a 27-year-old Syrian blew himself up outside a music festival in the Bavarian town of Ansbach and wounded 15. The authorities had previously ordered him deported, and, on Thursday, Mr. de Maizière announced further measures to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. ""Nobody can guarantee absolute security,"" Mr. de Maizière said. ""But we must do everything in our power"" to try to ensure safety. ""One thing is sure,"" he added, ""our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division. We will not allow the terrorists that triumph."" Mr. de Maizière reiterated publicly concerns previously voiced privately by senior intelligence officials that Germany -- and Europe -- does not always know enough about migrants. He noted that the recent decision to register air travelers in and out of Europe was an improvement, and he urged that all of Germany's federal and state law enforcement and intelligence officials should have access to that information. ""We see in recent months that these offices must know exactly who is coming to Europe, and who is leaving it,"" he said. Other measures he proposed included combing the social media profiles of refugees and other migrants to look out for signs of radicalization, as the authorities in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have done. In a statement, Mr. de Maizière said that officials could have gleaned more information after a bomb threat at a mall in Dortmund if officials had had access to surveillance footage, which he said had been restricted by data protection officials. ""Overall, we must extend and optimize our use of I.T."" he said, referring to information technology. Mr. de Maizière said that the government had approved adding 4,600 security jobs, 3,250 of them in the federal police force, which, under the structure largely set up by the Allies after World War II, has traditionally taken a back seat to the police in the country's 16 states. The German press had speculated that the government would propose punishing doctors who failed to inform the authorities if they suspected patients of potentially committing violent acts. But patient confidentiality is taken very seriously in Germany, given the involvement of doctors in the crimes of the Nazi era; doctors can be punished for breaching patient privacy, with certain exceptions. Mr. de Maizière said on Thursday that the government would not change the principle of protecting patients, but he urged doctors to contact the government if they believe a patient is dangerous or about to commit a crime. Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the president of the German Medical Association, said in a statement that he was relieved ""that medical confidentiality is not to be called into question."" Mr. de Maizière also rejected as ""constitutionally problematic"" other ideas that some conservative lawmakers have floated, including a ban on burqas.

3664,1799321445.xml,"       LONDON -- Britain's startling decision to pull out of the European Union set off a cascade of aftershocks on Friday, costing Prime Minister David Cameron his job, plunging the financial markets into turmoil and leaving the country's future in doubt. The decisive win by the ""Leave"" campaign exposed deep divides: young versus old, urban versus rural, Scotland versus England. The recriminations flew fast, not least at Mr. Cameron, who had made the decision to call the referendum on membership in the bloc to manage a rebellion in his own Conservative Party, only to have it destroy his government and tarnish his legacy. The result of the so-called Brexit vote presented another stiff challenge to the leaders of the other leading European powers as they confront spreading populist anger. It was seized on by far-right and anti-Brussels parties across Europe, with Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France calling for a ""Frexit"" referendum and Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands calling for a ""Nexit."" European officials met in Brussels to begin discussing a response and to emphasize their commitment to strengthening and improving the bloc, which will have 27 members after Britain's departure. ""At stake is the breakup, pure and simple, of the union,"" Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said, adding, ""Now is the time to invent another Europe."" Germany urged calm. ""Today marks a turning point for Europe,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said. ""It is a turning point for the European unification process."" Financial markets swooned as it became apparent that the Leave forces would prevail, with the British pound and global stock prices plummeting in value as the vote tally showed the Remain camp falling further behind. With all votes counted, Leave was ahead by 52 percent to 48 percent, an enormous snub to Britain's elite. The process of withdrawal is likely to play out slowly, perhaps taking years. It will mean pulling out of the world's largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and abandoning a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britain's legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britain's economy. The main ways in which the change will be felt are on trade -- Britain will lose automatic access to the European single market -- and on immigration, with Britain no longer bound to allow any European Union citizen to live and work in the country. Britain will have to try to negotiate new deals covering those issues. To those in Britain who supported remaining in Europe, the result of Thursday's in-or-out referendum was a painful rejection, leaving the country exposed to a possible economic downturn and signaling a step away from the multiculturalism that they say has made Britain among Europe's most vibrant societies. To backers of leaving, the outcome was vindication of their belief that Britain could pursue an independent course in the world, free of the Brussels bureaucracy and able to control the flow of immigrants into the country. ""Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,"" Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a.m. For Mr. Cameron, the results were a humiliating disaster, forcing him to announce his departure only 13 months after he won re-election behind a surprisingly large Conservative majority in national elections. Critics said that he had led Britain out of Europe for no good reason and that the unity of the United Kingdom itself was threatened, with Scotland now more likely to try again to bolt. Speaking in front of 10 Downing Street early Friday, with his wife, Samantha, standing nearby, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a new leader had been chosen by his party, a decision he expected by October. He will stay now to provide stability, but a new prime minister, he said, should formally begin Britain's withdrawal from the European Union and negotiate the terms of that divorce. ""I held nothing back,"" Mr. Cameron said. His voice breaking, he said, ""I love this country and I feel honored to have served it."" His statement created an immediate churn in the political waters, with speculation that the two Conservatives most likely to succeed him are Boris Johnson, the flamboyant former mayor of London who helped lead the Leave campaign, and Theresa May, the Home secretary, who supported Mr. Cameron and Remain, but concentrated on doing her job rather than campaigning. Mr. Johnson was booed Friday morning as he left his home in London, which voted overwhelmingly for Remain. In a brief statement later, Mr. Johnson praised Mr. Cameron, an old friend and rival from school days, as ""an extraordinary politician"" and said he was sad to see him go. Mr. Johnson refused to answer questions about his own future but praised the result. ""We can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,"" he said. But if Britain's Treasury and Central Bank are to be believed, the economic hit the country will take from leaving the single market of the European Union will be considerable, with permanent loss of economic growth, higher unemployment and lower tax receipts. The immediate market reaction was an effort to find a floor in the midst of so much uncertainty, said Barrington Pitt Miller, an equity research analyst at Janus Capital. But he said he expected British economic growth to be zero or negative in the short and medium term, with a secondary impact over time as London's financial services sector, which makes up about 10 percent of the economy, begins to move staff members and headquarters to Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin. A lot will depend on how the European Union chooses in the end to respond -- whether it is ""vindictive, friendly or frightened,"" he said. Mr. Johnson and some in the Leave campaign argued that the other European nations valued trade with Britain so much that they would negotiate a special deal after Britain's withdrawal to let Britain remain in the single market without having to guarantee freedom of movement and labor. That seems highly unlikely because it would only encourage other nations to pressure Brussels. But it may be that as the dust settles, some sort of association agreement with Britain could be negotiated, as Ms. Merkel suggested on Friday, though the price could be high. The economy aside, the United Kingdom itself now faces a threat to its survival. Scotland voted by 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the European Union, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Friday that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" for Scotland to be dragged out of it against its will. Another independence referendum, she said, ""is now highly likely."" Appearing before reporters in front of the flags of Scotland and the European Union, Ms. Sturgeon, who leads the dominant Scottish National Party, said, ""It is a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table."" The threat is real, but any new vote will not come soon, because it is only two years since the last one, which the Scottish nationalists lost, and the price of oil, on which the Scottish economy largely depends, has dropped. Northern Ireland, too, voted for Remain, although Protestants and Roman Catholics, as usual, were split. But the prospect of an open border with Ireland now becoming a hard border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will change matters and require checks of passports and goods, putting strain on the Good Friday peace agreement. In England, which voted for Leave, there are obvious strains, too. They can be found between the young who voted in large numbers for Remain and those over 45, who voted for Leave; between the cities and the countryside; between richer and poorer; and between better educated and less educated. London itself, the glittering, expensive, multicultural and multinational global capital, with its many immigrants and liberal values, was isolated in a sea of those favoring Leave; in some sense, the vote was against the wealthy elites who live in London and rule everyone else from there. Last, there is the chasm between political leaders, nearly all of whom backed Remain, and many of their voters, who rebuffed them. Bronwen Maddox, former editor of Prospect Magazine and the new director of the Institute for Government, a research institution, said in an email that ""there is a growing intolerance for representative government, which is likely to have consequences for the ability of any government to run the country."" The referendum, she suggested, might have been about Brussels, but it revealed and unleashed many other forces. Those forces, she said, ""have ejected the U.K. from the European Union; they may now wreak similar turmoil on the old political parties themselves.""

3140,1022536293.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- Working through the night in the face of pressure from the embattled euro zone countries Italy and Spain, European leaders agreed early Friday to use the Continent's bailout funds to recapitalize struggling banks directly, according to the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy.   The decision, by leaders of the 17-nation euro zone, would allow help to banks without adding directly to the sovereign debt of countries, which has been a problem for Spain and potentially for Italy. Both countries have seen the interest rates on their debt rise to levels that would be unsustainable in the long term, and the Italian and Spanish leaders, Prime Ministers Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy, came here to push their colleagues to help.   Late Thursday, they said they would block all other agreements, on a 130 billion euro growth pact for example, until their colleagues did something to help take the pressure off the third- and fourth-largest economies in the euro zone. If their countries could not go to the markets to rollover their debt, Mr. Monti and Mr. Rajoy argued, there would be an existential threat to the euro in the short to medium term. Spain is seeking 100 billion euros to recapitalize its banks, damaged by a property bubble.   Mr. Van Rompuy called the agreement a ""breakthrough that banks can be recapitalized directly,"" which represents a concession by northern European countries, including Germany. The leaders agreed that the euro zone's permanent bailout fund, the 500 billion euro European Stability Mechanism, due to come into being next month, could recapitalize banks directly once a banking supervisory body overseen by the European Central Bank has been set up. That should happen by the end of the year, he said. The joint banking supervisory body is also a breakthrough, an effort to ensure the future health of the area's banks, but details about that component of the agreement were scarce.   In the meantime, Mr. Van Rompuy said the euro zone would make more ""flexible"" use of the existing bailout funds for ""well-behaving nations"" in order ""to reassure markets and to get again some stability around the sovereign bonds of our member states."" There would be unspecified conditions attached to this use of the bailout funds, he said, but it would not require a special adjustment or austerity program.   Mr. Monti, an experienced European player and former European Union commissioner, hailed the agreement as a ""very important deal for the future of the E.U. and the euro zone,"" adding, ""it is a double satisfaction for Italy."" He had argued that other euro zone leaders must find ways to help ""virtuous countries"" like his own and Spain, he said, which were fixing their economies and were solvent, but were under speculative market pressure.   Countries that request bond support from the rescue fund will have to sign a memorandum of understanding setting out their existing police commitments and agreeing to a timetable. But they will not face the intrusive oversight of a ""troika"" of international leaders to which Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been subjected, Mr. Monti said.   The euro zone ""will be strengthened by this,"" Mr. Monti said, calling it a step on the path to collective responsibility and mutualized debt. The decision also opened the way to agreement on the growth pact, and the euro rose in early trading in Asia on the news.   Italy has no immediate plans to ask for help from the existing funds, he Monti said, on the assumption that markets will ease after this agreement although many details were unclear. For Spain, help from the temporary bailout funds will be transferred to the permanent one once it is set up, Mr. Van Rompuy said.   The decision followed a difficult afternoon and night of discussions, after most leaders of countries who do not belong to the euro zone had left Brussels.   Italy and Spain were supported in their efforts by the new French president, Francois Hollande, who arrived here on Thursday demanding ""rapid solutions"" to the euro's problems. But Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gave little sign of budging on any quick fixes, arguing that existing mechanisms could be used, illustrating some of the deep divisions as European leaders try to restore faith in the single currency.   Heading into the two-day meeting, Ms. Merkel had brushed aside questions about the mounting economic pressure on Spain and Italy, both of which saw their borrowing costs spike again on Thursday to ever-more-painful levels that are not sustainable in the long run.   Mr. Hollande showed no such reticence. ""I have come here to get very rapid solutions to support those countries that are in the most difficulty in the markets, and that have made considerable efforts to shore up their public accounts,"" he said.   European Union summit conferences were once scripted by the governments in Paris and Berlin, which often dictated the course by releasing a ""Franco-German letter"" just before other leaders arrived. But despite repeated meetings in recent days, there had been no far-reaching French-German proposal, which the two leaders promised on the day six weeks ago that Mr. Hollande became president.   Ms. Merkel has given Mr. Hollande the growth pact that he demanded during his election campaign, but it is largely made up of existing funds. There had been little effort to disguise their differences over sharing liability, through collectivized debt, to avert a euro zone breakup and take the pressure off Spain and Italy.   ""The current disconnect between Paris and Berlin is destabilizing the euro,"" Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London, wrote this week. ""In the long run the euro is not sustainable without a grand bargain between France and Germany.""   Approval of the growth pact was delayed by disagreements ranging from the mundane -- disputes over a European patent office -- to the more fundamental, with Italy and Spain insisting on a more urgent discussion of short-term measures to ease their financial strains. Mr. Monti told the other leaders that Italy would not agree to any other issue here until there was serious discussion of how the union could help bring down interest rates on Italian bonds, and Mr. Rajoy, under even more pressure from the markets, joined him.   In a speech on Wednesday to German lawmakers, Ms. Merkel argued that short-term solutions like pooled debt would be counterproductive without the construction, first, of a political and economic union among the member states in the euro zone. Without mutual responsibility and control over national budgets, she argued, there could not be mutual liabilities that can turn into blank checks.   While she made a concession Friday for the use of the bailout fund, it was accompanied by the requirement for a centralized banking supervisor, to ensure more bloc-wide discipline.   Financial markets have been looking ahead to the next meeting of the European Central Bank amid speculation that it would be forced to step in with new funds again or slash interest rates.   The central bank, however, indicated that it would not make any move until it saw concrete progress on the political side.   ""How the E.U. summit pans out will be a key influence on what the E.C.B. opts to do,"" Kenneth Wattret, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote in a research note.   The European Union gathering has goals for both the short and longer term -- to ease the pressure on Spain and Italy, but also to lay the ground for increased integration of the euro zone.   The leaders will also discuss proposals for the future of the euro drafted by the heads of the major European institutions and released Tuesday, plans that could lead to the creation of a euro zone finance ministry and -- eventually -- greater sharing of debt burdens.

2703,1015214569.xml,"      BERLIN -- The pressure for Germany to reverse its defiant course on issuing euro bonds continued to grow on Tuesday, one day before a dinner meeting of European leaders. But German officials remained adamant that there was no way they would bend on collective debt, even if the new French president, as expected, makes it a dining-room topic.    Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, finds herself increasingly on the defensive over the bonds, which she opposes as a near-term remedy for the region's financial woes. But proponents say that bonds jointly issued by the 17 members of the euro currency union are the best long-term solution to a crisis that has destabilized global markets and threatened the future of the currency.    Ms. Merkel is expected to face a growing front led by President Francois Hollande of France when she travels to Brussels on Wednesday for the informal meeting of European Union leaders. Whether or not Mr. Hollande wins the argument, he has helped change the nature of the debate.   After a focus for months on cutting spending and budget deficits, the discussion has shifted to ways to bolster growth. Many economists and policy makers now say that the surest way to end the crisis is for European states to move toward jointly issued debt, known as euro bonds.   The sense of crisis escalated Tuesday, as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its growth forecast for the euro zone and said Europe risked creating a self-sustaining cycle of decline that could have dire effects for the world economy.    Depending on the country's perspective, euro bonds are either an old and particularly persistent rash (Germany and a few others) or an increasingly popular idea for addressing the region's economic plight (almost everyone else). Although many details would need to be worked out, the idea is to have the euro zone countries collectively issue bonds that would be guaranteed by all 17 members. But the most creditworthy countries, like Germany, would almost certainly have their borrowing costs rise, as they, in essence, would guarantee the loans of their debt-saddled neighbors.    Though Ms. Merkel may be increasingly taking the minority position, she is not alone. Others arguing against euro bonds include Austria, Finland and the Netherlands.    ""Euro bonds appear to be a straightforward solution, an easy answer to a very difficult question,"" said Tanja A. Borzel, a professor of European Union politics at the Free University in Berlin. ""The real question is whether this is politically feasible and even legally feasible in Germany.""    Conservative German state politicians from Ms. Merkel's bloc put out a statement on Tuesday rejecting euro bonds, calling them ""the fatal path to debt union."" When Germany's constitutional court signed off on the euro zone bailout fund in September, it also appeared to rule out taking on collective debt.   In her public comments on euro bonds, Ms. Merkel has not completely dismissed them as a potential long-term solution. But a senior German official said that there was ""no legal basis"" for euro bonds and that they were ""explicitly forbidden"" by European Union treaties. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about closed-door discussions, said Ms. Merkel's position on euro bonds had not changed and was not likely to.   ""I do not see euro bonds as a subject for tomorrow evening,"" the official said. ""Our position is well known.""   No major policy changes can happen without approval from Germany, Europe's biggest economy and the last of the euro zone's large countries to maintain a triple-A credit rating. Throughout the euro crisis, Ms. Merkel has pursued a strategy of standing firm until the last minute, before making small, tactical retreats. But euro bonds have been a red line for Ms. Merkel and her party.   Conservatives in Germany argue that allowing deeply indebted states to borrow more cheaply by piggybacking onto Germany's top credit rating would also ease pressure on those countries to make long-term economic overhauls. They say that euro bonds might address the problem for a few years, but that eventually the overall indebtedness of the bloc would reach unsustainable levels, and the smaller states would pull Germany under with them.   Many in Germany believe that much of the pressure on Ms. Merkel to change course is about politics more than economics. Mr. Hollande faces parliamentary elections next month and needs to show French voters that he is standing up to the German chancellor. President Obama, who hosted leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations last weekend at Camp David, wants Europe to contain its economic problems ahead of the November election.    While it is popular to talk about euro bonds, getting them off the ground would be another matter. Few believe that the Germans, or their allies in fiscal rectitude in Austria, Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere, would endorse a blank-check form of debt issuance for the Greeks. Many argue that some kind of hybrid system is more likely.      Credit: NICHOLAS KULISH and PAUL GEITNER; Nicholas Kulish reported from Berlin, and Paul Geitner from Brussels.

2139,433944103.xml,"      The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is running as fast as he can, but the European recession is gathering pace. After initially good reviews for his leadership and quick response to the crisis, even Mr. Sarkozy's vaunted hyperactivity is starting to seem a little counterproductive, especially among his allies.    He is seen as something of a magician, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find meaningful rabbits to pull out of a more tattered hat.   He tried again on Tuesday, faced with major layoffs from French companies like Renault, a quarterly decline of more than 23 percent in building permit applications and a sharp drop in consumer confidence, as measured by the government, to one of the lowest levels in 20 years. The signs of economic caution are everywhere here, including even a sudden drop in the sale of bottled water.    Trying to counteract fears of higher unemployment as the economy slows, Mr. Sarkozy announced a new program of subsidized work contracts, warned companies not to make unjustified layoffs and promised to loosen restrictions on short-term job contracts and Sunday work.   The Socialist he beat for the presidency, Segolene Royal, said Tuesday that  ""with a new plan practically every two days,"" Mr. Sarkozy had ""a credibility problem."" At the very least, she said, ""we must pay attention that each plan announced should start before announcing the next.""   But the problem runs deeper. Mr. Sarkozy is trying to promote a stronger economic role for the leaders of European Union states that use the euro, including a more powerful role for himself, in order to put pressure on the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which largely control the euro-zone economy.    But other major states, especially Germany, are skeptical about his intentions. They believe that Mr. Sarkozy, who has often excoriated the Central Bank for its focus on limiting inflation, wants to sharply increase the size of France's budget deficit -- despite European Union restrictions -- to  stimulate an economy considered to be in recession and to create jobs.   At the beginning of the American subprime mortgage crisis, Mr. Sarkozy, with France as the current six-month president of the European Union, got good marks for taking action. He called summit meetings, rushed to Washington, made proposals and even pulled the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, whose country does not use the euro, into an extraordinary summit meeting of the leaders of the states using the euro -- the so-called Eurogroup. In large part, the activity was intended to calm Europeans looking for leadership in a confusing time.    But they are also going to look for results, said Katinka Barysch, an economist and the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. ""For Sarkozy, it's a tricky strategy,"" she said. ""In a situation where confidence is in such short supply, having a politician leave the impression he's in charge and can do things can be good. But if like Sarkozy, you convene one summit after another and present one idea after another, you raise expectations you can't fulfill.""   Recent pronouncements by Mr. Sarkozy have rubbed the Germans and the British the wrong way, in part because he has reverted to an old habit of acting without consulting his allies.    Quite unusually for Europe, Mr. Sarkozy has also called other leaders to summit meetings on extremely short notice, sometimes just a day, a senior European diplomat said, causing consternation and confusion.   Mr. Sarkozy's relations with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have deteriorated again, diplomats and French officials say, over both his lack of consultation and his efforts to pressure the European Central Bank.   In particular, Mr. Sarkozy has called for two European initiatives that have been widely criticized. The first is a European Union sovereign fund to protect the ownership of important business with suddenly low stock prices. The other is a ""unified economic government"" of the European Union that would bring the heads of state together on economic issues, and not just the finance ministers.    Mr. Sarkozy argues that leaders must lead, and that with the Czech Republic and then Sweden, neither of which uses the euro, taking over the European Union presidency in 2009, Europe's ability to deal with the global financial crisis will be reduced.    He wants a new dialogue between country leaders and the European Parliament, suggests Daniel Cohen, a professor of economics at the Ecole Normale Superieure, as a way of undermining the European Commission. Mr. Sarkozy would also like to lead the Eurogroup for that period, instead of Jean-Claude Juncker of  Luxembourg, Mr. Cohen said.   ""There is a need to think and talk at the level of Europe, because there will be hard times coming,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""The ability of France to fight recession will be contingent on the size of its fiscal deficit,"" which is already at the European limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.    Mr. Sarkozy -- and not him alone -- wants the European Commission to relax the rules because of the recession, and that will produce ""a debate in difficult circumstances"" between France and Germany, which supports the limits and does not want to see European institutions undermined.   Mr. Sarkozy has worked politically without any real ideology in this crisis, promising safety to the French, appealing to nationalist instincts and trying to play an important role in Europe, and he has helped himself in the polls, said Pierre Rousselin, the foreign editor of Le Figaro.   ""Sarkozy is a bit a magician without clothes, but the important thing is the perception, and he's doing pretty well,"" Mr. Rousselin said. ""The time will come when people ask, 'Where's the beef?' But I'm not sure we've reached that point yet. To energize Europe itself is a pretty good thing.""

344,1988371898.xml,"KANDEL, Germany -- It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart.The death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German.
From the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year's molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities.
But the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe.
Yet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe.
Nevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing.
Something has shifted in Germany. Not so long ago, the logistical challenge and cost of integrating new migrants still dominated the public debate. These days, the growing unease with Chancellor Angela Merkel's migration policy has reached a new and febrile stage.
""I am scared,"" said Jana Weigel, a 24-year-old dental assistant, as she lit a candle outside the DM drugstore where the killing took place.
Calls have multiplied for mandatory medical exams to determine the age of migrants claiming to be minors and for swifter deportations of those who -- like the suspect -- have been denied asylum.
A preliminary coalition agreement between Ms. Merkel's conservatives and the more liberal Social Democrats announced on Friday includes a cap of 220,000 refugees per year and strictly limits the number of family members allowed to join a refugee in Germany.
Even in proudly tolerant and left-voting Kandel, the mood on the street has hardened. Many here took the killing personally. Before Mia broke up with Abdul, he had been welcomed into her family, Ms. Weigel pointed out, much like the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been welcomed to Germany.
""It makes you think,"" she said, ""how many others will betray our hospitality.""
Ms. Weigel's sense of insecurity was reinforced by a widely publicized study showing that the number of reported crimes in the state of Lower Saxony had risen by more than 10 percent over the past two years and that the increase could be attributed overwhelmingly to cases involving refugees.
Half of that increase is due to the fact that crimes involving migrants are twice as likely to be reported, the authors of the study said. Many of the people accused of crimes are young men under 30, a demographic that is most likely to commit crimes, even among Germans.
Less publicized was the other major finding of the report: Over all, violent crime, including murder and rape, remains well below its 2007 peak. The number of young offenders has decreased by half since then.
""The paradox is that Germany is still a very safe country, much safer than even a few years ago,"" said Christian Pfeiffer, a criminologist and a co-author of the report, which was commissioned by the government and released last week. ""But the perception is the opposite: People feel less safe. And when something like this murder happens, it confirms that feeling.""
Ask the Germans paying their respects at the ad hoc memorial for the girl who was killed -- a sea of candles and messages and photos of her with friends -- and they will reel off a list of crimes committed by migrants: a German woman who was raped by a Sudanese migrant in the nearby town of Speyer a few days earlier, another woman who was raped and strangled by an Afghan in Freiburg just over a year ago.
Ms. Weigel, who has a 2-year-old daughter, no longer leaves the house after dark. Last month, a terrorist attack was narrowly foiled at an ice rink in Karlsruhe, a 30-minute drive away.
""It feels like we've lost control,"" Ms. Weigel said. ""The state has lost control.""
Kandel is an orderly town of tastefully restored medieval houses and shops that close for lunch. It is also home to 125 refugees, most of them from Syria or Afghanistan.
Until Mia was killed, ""there was never a problem,"" said Günther Tielebörger, Kandel's mayor. He represents the Social Democrats, long the strongest party in the town. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, received less than 10 percent of the vote in the last election.
Kandel has a long tradition of tolerance. Three centuries ago, it welcomed Huguenot refugees from France. Where other villages in the region built a wall inside their churches to keep Catholics and Protestants apart, Kandel ripped down its wall and shared the church. One of the best restaurants in town serving regional specialties like ""pig's stomach"" is run by a Turk.
But this tolerance is now being tested.
Maja Mathias, 53, works in a local French bakery and has Turkish neighbors and a Croatian brother-in-law. ""I have no problem with foreigners,"" she said, standing behind a counter featuring freshly baked baguettes and pretzels. ""But there is always the fear: What else is coming?""
Beyond fear, the killing has stirred other resentments.
""German retirees who have worked hard for 45 years get less than the refugees,"" said Knoll Pede, 64, a town maintenance worker. He is no fan of President Trump, he said, ""but I wouldn't mind our politicians to do a bit of 'Germany First.""'
Such talk worries Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor. The benefits migrants receive are far less generous than Germans may believe, he said, and many of the migrants are barred from work until their asylum applications have been processed. But the optics matter.
""Germans feel neglected,"" Mr. Tielebörger said.
""We need to wake up,"" he said. Otherwise, he added, the left will lose votes to the right.
One of Mr. Tielebörger's former colleagues in local government is Heiko Wildberg, a former member of the liberal pro-immigration Greens party. Mr. Wildberg is now a lawmaker for the nationalist AfD in Berlin. For him, Mia's killing was a ""turning point.""
""This is not Berlin or Cologne; we are in small-town Germany,"" he said. ""This murder shows that the reality of the migrant crisis has arrived in the German province.""
The AfD was quick off the mark, organizing a silent march through Kandel two days after the killing. The more extremist National Party of Germany followed suit.
Meanwhile, the local benefits office in Kandel had to barricade its doors because its employees had received so many threats. ""Accomplices,"" anonymous messages called them.
Some here accuse the authorities of not doing enough to protect Mia. Abdul had stalked her online and in person and beaten up one of her classmates in a fit of jealousy.
On Dec. 15, her parents had reported him to the police. Twelve days later, as she was shopping with friends, he stabbed her repeatedly with a knife he had bought in a supermarket next door. She later died of her wounds.
After her father told the German tabloid Bild that her ex-boyfriend ""was definitely not 15,"" demands for medical exams to verify the claims of refugees who say they are minors have been revived.
The ethics commission of the body representing Germany's doctors has said that such tests -- which include X-rays of hand, collar and jaw bones as well as genital exams -- violate ""bodily integrity"" and can be inaccurate by up to two years.
They have nonetheless become a rallying cry at the highest level of politics.
""In all cases, where no official and real document is presented, we need to determine the age in another way, if needed through medical examinations,"" said the conservative interior minister, Thomas de Maizière.
When Abdul arrived in Germany in April 2016, he said he was 14, and apparently none of the officials registering him raised serious doubts about his age. As part of the court case against him, a series of medical exams will now seek to confirm his age.
Austria, Sweden and the German state of Saarland are among the places conducting such exams regularly.
There is an incentive for migrants to be listed as under 18. Government benefits, access to German lessons and job opportunities are better for minors. In Saarland, more than a third of the migrants who were tested appeared to be over 18.
Most of the unaccompanied-minor migrants are integrating well, said Anne Spiegel, the integration minister for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which includes Kandel. ""They are attending school, learning German and signing up for apprenticeships,"" she said.
Still, officials like Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor, say that every transgression by a migrant gets disproportionate attention, leading to the opposite impression.
There was another shocking homicide in Kandel in recent weeks, he pointed out. A man killed his wife and two children. That one did not make the national news.
""If the boy had been German,"" Mr. Tielebörger said, ""we wouldn't be having this conversation.""

3041,2447459764.xml,"The fallout from the chaotic presidential debate included pushback from Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert. On Wednesday, he countered what he called President Trump's misrepresentation of his position on a pandemic staple that has also been unusually divisive: masks.During the debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that Dr. Fauci had declared early in the pandemic that ""masks are not good. Then he changed his mind."" And when Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic opponent, said that mask-wearing and social distancing could save 100,000 lives by the end of the year, Mr. Trump said, ""Dr. Fauci said the opposite.""""Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months know that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,"" Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview on the ABC News podcast ""Start Here.""Dr. Fauci explained that ""very early on in the pandemic,"" the authorities did not recommend masks for most people because of concerns that masks were in short supply. Dr. Fauci said he had been a forceful advocate of wearing masks ever since it became clear that people without symptoms could transmit the coronavirus. By then, scientists had also found that ""cloth coverings worked as well as surgical masks, so the idea of a shortage"" was no longer an issue, he said, ""because anybody could get a mask.""""At that point, which is now months and months ago, I have been on the airways, on the radio, on TV, begging people to wear masks,"" Dr. Fauci said. ""And I keep talking in the context of wear a mask, keep physical distance, avoid crowds, wash your hands and do things more outdoors versus indoors.""States of Emergency in Eastern EuropeIn Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned that coronavirus infections would probably continue to rise. Germany reported nearly 2,100 new cases on Tuesday, and its seven-day average has been above 1,500 cases for the last two weeks. ""We have a difficult time ahead of us with autumn and winter approaching,"" she said during a budget debate. She was forced to defend her government's response to the pandemic after the far-right party Alternative for Germany accused her of promoting ""corona socialism,"" a charge she denied.Looking to an October with no Oktoberfest -- the beer-centric festival in Munich announced its cancellation in April -- Ms. Merkel and German state governors agreed to lower the limits on group gatherings. They also assented to fines for businesses -- including bars and restaurants -- that are careless about collecting customers' contact information.East of Germany, new states of emergency are coming to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both took the action after experiencing surges in new cases.In the Czech Republic, Roman Prymula, the new health minister, had said before taking the job last week that it would be ""appropriate"" to consider declaring a state of emergency. The country has reported 14,865 cases in the last seven days, or 138 for every 100,000 residents, but the highest daily counts have been just above 2,100. He had predicted 5,000 to 6,000 cases a day ""unless we take further action.""The state of emergency will take effect on Monday, after regional elections are completed on Friday and Saturday. Voters who are quarantining at home can cast ballots from their cars at drive-in balloting stations set up by the military. Under the state of emergency, high schools in the hardest-hit regions will be closed for at least two weeks. Outdoor gatherings with more than 20 people will be prohibited, as will indoor get-togethers for more than 10. The exceptions: movie screenings and theatrical performances.In Slovakia, Prime Minister Igor Matovic acknowledged that the state of emergency gave his government the power to impose additional restrictions. But he said that did not necessarily mean another lockdown. He wrote on his Facebook page that ""we will decide whether to continue"" the state of emergency after 45 days or whether ""we will be able to return to normal."" The health ministry said Slovakia hit a single-day record of 567 cases on Tuesday, about 5 percent of the country's total for the entire pandemic.Indoor Dining Returns to New York CityThey set the tables farther apart than before. They readied the menus. And then waiters and waitresses, chefs and restaurant owners waited.Wednesday was the first day in months that restaurants in New York City could serve customers indoors. That was a major milestone on the city's road to recovery. But the question was whether diners would feel safe enough to go back to eat indoors, a question that became more complicated as officials again scrambled to tamp down clusters of the coronavirus in several neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.Mayor Bill de Blasio said that cases in most of nine ZIP code areas had continued to rise, but that the daily positivity rate had dropped to 0.94 percent. On Tuesday, the city reported a 3.25 percent rate, the highest since June. It was not immediately clear why the rate had oscillated so drastically; a spokesman for the city's health department said the rate could be affected by the number of tests conducted each day. The seven-day average rate, which officials have said is a stronger measure of how the virus is spreading over time, crept up slightly on Wednesday to 1.46 percent, from 1.38 percent on Tuesday.Officials said the city was sending 1,000 municipal employees, including 400 police officers and 300 members of the city's test and trace program, to the neighborhoods where cases had exploded. Their assignments will include telling people about the risks of the virus -- and cracking down on people and businesses caught violating public health rules.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said there were a total of 20 hot-spot ZIP codes, including in the city and the Mid-Hudson region. They accounted for 23 percent of all cases in the state, but only 6 percent of the population. ""It's still those hot-spot ZIP codes that we have to watch because if you don't control a cluster, a cluster becomes community spread,"" he said, imploring local officials to uphold state-issued pandemic rules. ""Do step one first: Enforce the mask compliance -- issue a ticket,"" he said. ""And if that doesn't work, yes, then we're going to have to take more serious actions.""Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-10-01
3775,1764609135.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  With more than a million migrants having reached Europe in the last year and many more on the way, NATO stepped into the crisis for the first time on Thursday, saying it would deploy ships to the Aegean Sea in an attempt to stop smugglers. But while the hastily made decision reflected the growing urgency of the situation, it was not clear that it would have much practical effect on the flow of refugees fleeing Syria's five-year civil war: The alliance said it would not seek to block the often rickety and overcrowded migrant vessels or turn them back, and military officials were scrambling to determine precisely what role their warships would play. NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that ""this is not about stopping or pushing back refugee boats."" Gen. Philip M. Breedlove of the United States Air Force, NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, subsequently told reporters here that his staff was figuring out the rules of engagement and how to deal with refugee boats that are intercepted. ""This mission has literally come together in the last 20 hours, and I have been tasked now to go back and define the mission,"" General Breedlove said. ""We had some very rapid decision making, and now we have to go out to do some military work."" Adding military muscle to what has largely been treated in Europe as a humanitarian issue reflected concerns across the Continent that further waves of refugees are likely to head toward Greece and beyond in coming weeks amid intensified fighting in Syria and improving weather. Some international aid groups quickly criticized the NATO decision. Doctors Without Borders described it as shortsighted and misplaced. ""How many deaths will it take before Europe, Turkey and others focus their energy on providing humanitarian solutions rather than deterrence measures that clearly miss the point?"" the group said in a statement. Calling on NATO to help patrol the Aegean was first raised as a possibility on Monday during talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country is the main destination for the migrants reaching Europe, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which is confronting a new mass of refugees along its border with Syria. Officials said three NATO vessels, from Canada, Germany and Turkey, were being deployed to the Aegean Sea under the command of Jörg Klein, a German rear admiral. The group will focus on monitoring the waterways and on providing intelligence to the European Union. There was no indication that any vessels from the United States would participate directly in the effort. NATO will also enhance its surveillance of the Turkey-Syria border, monitoring the movement of migrants and the activities of smugglers, officials said. Ivo H. Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO, said the military alliance had refrained from direct involvement in the migrant crisis before because European Union officials had insisted that they were handling the situation. The European Union has a border agency, Frontex, but it lacks substantial resources and in essence relies on national authorities, like the Italian Navy and the Greek Coast Guard. It failed to prevent the deaths of 3,800 people who drowned in the Mediterranean last year while trying to enter the European Union, and more than 400 have drowned this year already. ""The E.U. obviously wasn't doing enough, and NATO can do more,"" Mr. Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said in a phone interview. ""Clearly, the U.S. supported it."" He added, ""This is not the solution to the migrant and refugee crisis, but it represents an acknowledgment that not enough is being done to address the crisis."" NATO, like the European Union, operates by consensus. Jeffrey Rathke, a former American diplomat and NATO official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the announcement reflected the reality that ""Frontex is not able to cope with the situation"" and that the United States and Turkey, which are members of NATO but not of the European Union, could do more. ""Could and should NATO have done this earlier?"" he asked. ""I'd say yes -- but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do this now."" The American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said that three NATO members -- Germany, Greece and Turkey -- had asked NATO for help with the sea patrols, as they struggle to deal with the huge number of refugees who have fled violence in Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iraq, as well as Syria and other conflict-torn countries. They have been joined by migrants fleeing poverty in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, many of them ineligible for political asylum. The NATO defense ministers ""tasked NATO military authorities to provide its advice for options for implementing it,"" Mr. Carter said, calling the human traffickers ""a criminal syndicate which is exploiting these poor people."" NATO has a track record of search-and-rescue and antipiracy efforts, but whether it can actually curb human traffickers in this case remains to be seen. While the migrants typically rely on people smugglers for help in getting to Turkey and then across the sea to Greece and onward to northern Europe, they are often determined to make the voyage alone despite the risks -- and the people running the smuggling rings are rarely on the vessels they send toward Greece. ""The people piloting the ships from Turkey to Greece are relatively low-level people,"" Mr. Rathke said. ""But having Turkey and Greek vessels, led by Germany, will provide an opportunity for greater cooperation which, frankly, hasn't functioned well to date."" Ian O. Lesser, a foreign policy expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said the announcement was ""in some sense symbolic, but also meaningful: NATO's strategy in the years ahead is going to be driven not only by what's happening in the east, with Russia, but also in the south, with the Mediterranean, as a result of the chaos in the Middle East and North Africa."" Also on Thursday, the German government said it would extend controls on its borders for an additional three months. Germany established patrols, notably along its southern border with Austria, in mid-September because about 13,000 people were arriving in the southern city of Munich every day. Although the number of arrivals has since dropped by half, the German government is still struggling to find shelter for all of the new ones, while bracing for more. ""A lasting and clear relaxation of the influx of people from other countries into Germany that would be necessary to lift the temporary border controls is not foreseeable at this time,"" the Interior Ministry said on Thursday, adding that it had coordinated with Austria and its other European partners. The German government also agreed on Thursday to permit the family members of refugees who had entered the country as unaccompanied minors to enter the country in cases of particular hardship. The agreement allows family reunifications only when ""urgent humanitarian reasons"" justify the granting of asylum to the children's parents. In the Aegean resort town of Bodrum, Turkey, on Thursday, the trial of two Syrians, Muwafaka Alabash and Asem Alfrhad, opened. They are accused of causing the drownings of a 3-year-old Syrian, Alan Kurdi, and of four other migrants, including the boy's mother and brother, in September. Images of the boy's lifeless body lying facedown on a beach in Bodrum helped focus world attention on the crisis. The two men each face up to 35 years in prison if convicted of charges of human smuggling and causing the deaths of five people ""through deliberate negligence."" Credit: MICHAEL S.

3874,2380530640.xml,"Then contrast them with the leadership shown by Andrew Cuomo, Justin Trudeau and Angela Merkel.In a time of global emergency, we need calm, directness and, above all, hard facts. Only the opposite is on offer from the Trump White House. It is therefore time to call the president's news conferences for what they are: propaganda.We may as well be watching newsreels approved by the Soviet Politburo. We're witnessing the falsification of history in real time. When Donald Trump, under the guise of social distancing, told the White House press corps on Thursday that he ought to get rid of 75 to 80 percent of them -- reserving the privilege only for those he liked -- it may have been chilling, but it wasn't surprising. He wants to thin out their ranks until there's only Pravda in the room.Sometimes, I stare at Deborah Birx during these briefings and I wonder if she understands that this is the footage historians will be looking at 100 years from now -- the president rambling on incoherently, vainly, angrily, deceitfully, while she watches, her face stiff with the strangled horror of a bride enduring an inappropriate toast.If the public wants factual news briefings, they need to tune in to those who are giving them: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose addresses appear with English subtitles on Deutsche Welle. They should start following the many civic-minded epidemiologists and virologists and contagion experts on Twitter, like Harvard's Marc Lipsitch and Yale's Nicholas Christakis, whose threads have been invaluable primers in a time of awful confusion.These are people with a high tolerance for uncertainty. It's the president's incapacity to tolerate it -- combined with his bottomless need to self-flatter and preserve his political power -- that leads, so often, to his spectacular fits of deception and misdirection. At his Thursday news conference, a discussion of chloroquine and other experimental therapies formed the core of his remarks, when those drugs and therapies are untested and unproven and, in some cases, won't be ready for several months, as NBC's Peter Alexander pointed out the following day.""What do you say to Americans who are scared?"" Alexander pressed.""I say that you're a terrible reporter,"" Trump answered.Only a liar -- and a weak man with delusions of competence -- would be so unnerved by the facts.Compare this to Cuomo, who takes questions at his news conferences calmly and systematically -- and, more to the point, has a substantive response when asked the same questions about anxiety. He hears it. He relates to it. He says it's real.""People are in a small apartment, they're in a house, they're worried, they're anxious. Just, be mindful of that,"" the governor said Friday. ""Those three-word sentences can make all the difference: 'I miss you.' 'I love you.' 'I'm thinking about you.' 'I wish I was there with you.' 'I'm sorry you're going through this.' 'I'm sorry we're going through this.""'On Friday, Cuomo said something else that was quite striking, as he was issuing his executive order for nonessential workers in New York to stay home, other than to run errands or exercise outside. ""If someone wants to blame someone or complain about someone, blame me,"" he said. ""There is no one else who is responsible for this decision.""Cuomo is nothing if not politically shrewd. He knows full well how this comment compares to Mr. Trump's ""I don't take responsibility at all.""But telling the media that they're peddling fake news is straight from the playbook of the political gangsters of the last century. So many of Trump's moves are.Having each of his cabinet members fulsomely thank him for his leadership and congratulate him for his ""farsightedness"" before each of their remarks: Check. Making sure each one stays on a message, even if that message has nothing to do with his or her purview: Check.(Alex Azar may have been the worst offender, speaking Friday to the urgency of closing the southern border. He's the secretary of health and human services, not homeland security. Yet he was parroting Trump's message about the coronavirus, one specifically tailored to the base: We're keeping brown immigrants from spreading it.)How about Orwellian doublespeak? Ooooooh, check. Trump and his team are continually deploying words and phrases that disguise a reality that suggests the opposite. Vice President Mike Pence talks about a ""strong and seamless"" partnership with the states, when at the same time Mr. Trump is trolling the states, telling Cuomo to get his own respirators.Pence speaks relentlessly of a ""whole-of-government approach,"" when in fact the government is hollowed out -- defunded to fight pandemics, denuded of experts -- and broken in shards, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sidelined in this fight, and the president's task force now mutely competing with a shadow group run by the president's son-in-law.On Friday, Trump said he cherished journalism, and his secretary of state complained about disinformation on Twitter. There are simply too many two-plus-two-is-five moments to count.But most dangerous of all is Trump's insistence that things are fine, or will be shortly, that they'll be stronger and better and greater than ever. We don't have any evidence that this is true, and the president finds any suggestion to the contrary quite rude. When a journalist pointed out to him on Thursday that the economy had all but ground to a halt, Trump cut him off.""What's the rest of your question?"" he snapped. ""We know that. Everybody in the room knows that.""Here's the truth: Things might be hard -- unfathomably hard -- for months, perhaps even north of a year. Anyone who's reading or listening to other sources of news besides the president knows that. It takes sensitivity and strength and intelligence to speak truthfully to the public about imminent hardship, the prospect of enduring pain.So I listen to Justin Trudeau, a sci-fi experience, a dispatch from an alternate universe that prioritizes the needs and anxieties of the middle class. He speaks about immediate concerns: The kids will be all right. There'll be food. You won't be booted out of your home. Not how our president is speaking right now, but it's a road map for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 to follow.And I listen to Cuomo, who says the same thing. His news conference on Friday was about the practical things, knowing the entire state -- country, globe -- had just taken a precipitous slide down Maslow's hierarchy of needs, with food, shelter and safety now topmost on many people's minds. No one can evict you for 90 days. We're getting hospital beds. We're recruiting doctors and nurses in training to fight this fight, and we're coaxing medical professionals out of retirement.Then he spoke from the heart. One of his daughters was in quarantine. ""To tell you the truth, I had some of the best conversations with her that I've ever had,"" Cuomo said. She was alone for two weeks. ""We talked about things in depth that we didn't have time to talk about in the past,"" he continued, ""or we didn't have the courage or the strength to talk about in the past -- feelings I had, about mistakes I had made along the way that I wanted to express my regret and talk through with her.""He was expressing fallibility.

922,1652317243.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. Many economists, including Janet Yellen, view global economic troubles since 2008 largely as a story about ""deleveraging"" -- a simultaneous attempt by debtors almost everywhere to reduce their liabilities. Why is deleveraging a problem? Because my spending is your income, and your spending is my income, so if everyone slashes spending at the same time, incomes go down around the world. Or as Ms. Yellen put it in 2009, ""Precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms -- and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state -- nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."" So how much progress have we made in returning the economy to that ""normal state""? None at all. You see, policy makers have been basing their actions on a false view of what debt is all about, and their attempts to reduce the problem have actually made it worse. First, the facts: Last week, the McKinsey Global Institute issued a report titled ""Debt and (Not Much) Deleveraging,"" which found, basically, that no nation has reduced its ratio of total debt to G.D.P. Household debt is down in some countries, especially in the United States. But it's up in others, and even where there has been significant private deleveraging, government debt has risen by more than private debt has fallen. You might think our failure to reduce debt ratios shows that we aren't trying hard enough -- that families and governments haven't been making a serious effort to tighten their belts, and that what the world needs is, yes, more austerity. But we have, in fact, had unprecedented austerity. As the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, real government spending excluding interest has fallen across wealthy nations -- there have been deep cuts by the troubled debtors of Southern Europe, but there have also been cuts in countries, like Germany and the United States, that can borrow at some of the lowest interest rates in history. All this austerity has, however, only made things worse -- and predictably so, because demands that everyone tighten their belts were based on a misunderstanding of the role debt plays in the economy. You can see that misunderstanding at work every time someone rails against deficits with slogans like ""Stop stealing from our kids."" It sounds right, if you don't think about it: Families who run up debts make themselves poorer, so isn't that true when we look at overall national debt? No, it isn't. An indebted family owes money to other people; the world economy as a whole owes money to itself. And while it's true that countries can borrow from other countries, America has actually been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it did before, and Europe is a net lender to the rest of the world. Because debt is money we owe to ourselves, it does not directly make the economy poorer (and paying it off doesn't make us richer). True, debt can pose a threat to financial stability -- but the situation is not improved if efforts to reduce debt end up pushing the economy into deflation and depression. Which brings us to current events, for there is a direct connection between the overall failure to deleverage and the emerging political crisis in Europe. European leaders completely bought into the notion that the economic crisis was brought on by too much spending, by nations living beyond their means. The way forward, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted, was a return to frugality. Europe, she declared, should emulate the famously thrifty Swabian housewife. This was a prescription for slow-motion disaster. European debtors did, in fact, need to tighten their belts -- but the austerity they were actually forced to impose was incredibly savage. Meanwhile, Germany and other core economies -- which needed to spend more, to offset belt-tightening in the periphery -- also tried to spend less. The result was to create an environment in which reducing debt ratios was impossible: Real growth slowed to a crawl, inflation fell to almost nothing and outright deflation has taken hold in the worst-hit nations. Suffering voters put up with this policy disaster for a remarkably long time, believing in the promises of the elite that they would soon see their sacrifices rewarded. But as the pain went on and on, with no visible progress, radicalization was inevitable. Anyone surprised by the left's victory in Greece, or the surge of anti-establishment forces in Spain, hasn't been paying attention. Nobody knows what happens next. Bookmakers are still giving better than even odds that Greece will stay in the euro. But if it doesn't, I don't believe the damage would stop there -- a Greek exit is all too likely to threaten the whole currency project. And if the euro does fail, here's what should be written on its tombstone: ""Died of a bad analogy."" Correction:  February 13, 2015, Friday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Paul Krugman's column on Monday incorrectly described bookmakers' odds that Greece will exit the eurozone. The odds were worse than even, not better than even.  ",2015-02-09
440,1220306752.xml,"       Until a few months ago, Portugal was seen as a role model in the grinding euro zone crisis, adopting deep spending cuts and raising taxes to reduce its deficit without the outcry, protests and strikes that austerity policies have set off in other Southern European countries. International lenders praised the Portuguese government even as they arranged a 78 billion euro bailout for the country last year, following similar deals with Greece and Ireland. But the belt-tightening helped push Portugal deeper into one of Europe's longest recessions -- and the Portuguese have now joined the ranks of Europe's discontented, even coordinating a general strike with workers in neighboring Spain earlier this month. The hard times have also created strains within the center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. Still, the government managed to pass a stiff new austerity budget with steep tax increases on Tuesday, even as protesters demonstrated angrily outside the Parliament building. Such protests and work stoppages have become much more common over the past year, as daily life for many Portuguese families has become a struggle to stay afloat. Pay is being cut for government and private-sector workers alike, the unemployment has risen to nearly 16 percent, retirees face higher health costs and students will pay more for tuition without any assurance that their degrees will lead to jobs. In fact, many graduates are packing their bags to emigrate instead.

2285,220000155.xml,"      WASHINGTON -- With new European Union leaders practically invisible and some national leaders acting largely for domestic political reasons, the burden of shaping a rapid and credible restructuring program for Greece has fallen primarily to the International Monetary Fund -- exactly where proud European Union leaders had insisted it should not be.   Once again -- as during the 2008 financial crisis and the more recent halt in European air traffic due to volcanic ash -- European leaders have failed to surmount national interests and cobble together a coherent policy quickly enough to address a problem. In the process, they may have done permanent damage to the credibility of the European Union.    ""There is no doubt that the European project has suffered structural damage from this,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, a research fellow in European affairs and structural reform at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here. ""It's clear that the I.M.F. is the last man standing and is structuring the program.""   Criticism is rising about the competence of European leaders, which has worsened the plight of all the countries in the euro zone.   Senior United States officials, while not wanting to interfere in a European problem, have nonetheless expressed their anxiety to European counterparts and to the monetary fund itself. President Obama called Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Wednesday to lend his support and encouragement for her willingness to take a bolder position to try to calm the markets.   Mrs. Merkel has been the central figure in the debt crisis, as she has tried to respond to German voters' displeasure at having to bail out Greece, after years of bailing out eastern Germany. She delayed action on the problem for months, hoping to put it off until after critical regional elections on May 9.    Ultimately, that proved impossible. But her foot-dragging, combined with her insistence that Greece pay a severe long-term price for its profligacy and that the German Parliament approve any bailout, gave the markets both reason and room to run up the price of Greek debt to unsustainable levels. That forced the International Monetary Fund and the Europeans on Wednesday to practically quadruple the commitment to Greece, to try to calm the markets and not turn their attention to Portugal, another weak reed.   ""The fact that a German regional election can play such a disproportionate role in messing up efforts to contain what was a much smaller crisis several months ago is astonishing,"" Mr. Kirkegaard said. And the fact that there will be no European Union summit meeting until May 10, after the German elections, ""is so blatantly political,"" he said.   ""This is no way for an E.U. that has to contain an accelerating crisis and market panic to behave,"" Mr. Kirkegaard said.   The European monetary union was simply ""not ready for bad weather,"" said Janis A. Emmanouilidis, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels, saying it had no mechanisms in place to deal with issues of debt or the potential default of a member state. ""In the absence of such clear mechanisms, you need political leadership,"" he said. ""But the past months have seen a lack of leadership.""   The same problem was raised earlier this month by the ban on European air travel because of the ash spewed by an Icelandic volcano. With no European Union agreement governing European airspace, national leaders struggled, with astounding delays, to coordinate a policy while both airlines and passengers suffered.   But even worse, ""the current crisis has done enormous political damage,"" Mr. Emmanouilidis said. ""It is decreasing the trust among member states,"" he said, with Germany feeling betrayed by the ""Club Med"" countries of southern Europe, while those nations feel that Germany has procrastinated and shown an egregious lack of solidarity.   The outspoken Greek deputy prime minister, Theodoros Pangalos, has said that European Union leaders were ""not up to the scale of the task"" in dealing with the crisis.   ""I believe if Delors was in charge in Europe, Mitterrand in France and Kohl in Germany, things would not be the same,"" he told Greek television in February, referring to the former president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors; the former French president, Francois Mitterrand; and the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl.   While there is blame to go around on the national level, there is also finger-pointing at the new European Union leadership. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, has been largely invisible in his efforts to coordinate national leaders.   A French member of the European Parliament, Philippe Juvin, vented to Agence France-Presse: ""Where is the president of the European Council? What is the president of the Commission doing? Is there a European pilot in the Greek crisis? Or are they waiting for the collapse of the euro?""   But the Lisbon Treaty that created Mr. Van Rompuy's position, and which was intended to make the enlarged European Union more agile and coherent, deliberately left out powers for coordinating fiscal policies, which are the fiercely guarded prerogative of the separate nations. Even so, countries like Germany can only blame themselves for not insisting on realistic European oversight of Greek statistics, which were widely believed to be false for two decades.   Some analysts argue that this latest crisis will inevitably mean further European integration, with more fiscal oversight and coordination. Constance Le Grip, a French member of the European Parliament, said that ""it is clear that the E.U.'s hesitations have worsened the Greek situation.""   She added: ""Pragmatism and the E.U.'s adaptation skills are not sufficient anymore. We have to create new institutional responsibilities, for a new European economic government.""   But others are doubtful, arguing that most Europeans are already fed up with ""more Europe"" and that Germany, which might like to meddle in the budgets of others, would never accept any meddling in its own. It is also very likely that the German Constitutional Court, which has put limits on the ceding of sovereignty, would throw out any such oversight.   Some, like Mr. Kirkegaard, fear that the German court will rule against the Greek bailout funds, too, especially if they are spread out, as now envisaged, over a three-year period.   Still, this continuing crisis is leading to a more fundamental one, about European and national capabilities. ""Questions are asked to nations, not to the E.U. -- but nations cannot deal with this problem alone,"" said Dominique Reynie, director of the Foundation for Political Innovation and a political scientist at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. ""The silence of the E.U. and its institutions has become deafening. It is incapable of demonstrating that an entity called Europe exists. This is a situation that cannot go on.""   The European Union ""seems to be in a state of permanent self-promotion,"" he said. ""But it cannot ask its voters to relinquish part of their nations' sovereignty and then not answer the call when there's a problem.""

3151,2130201221.xml,"BERLIN -- Germany's interior minister faced calls for his resignation on Tuesday, after his dismissal of a spy chief who had given fuel to right-wing and anti-immigrant sentiment failed to end a monthslong controversy that weakened the government.The intelligence chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, became a hero to the growing far right in September, when he contradicted Chancellor Angela Merkel and questioned the validity of a video showing anti-immigrant protesters in the city of Chemnitz chasing people who appeared to be immigrants. At the time, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer -- who has advocated a harder line on immigration than Ms. Merkel has -- proposed moving Mr. Maassen to a position in his ministry, but resisted calls to fire him.But it recently emerged that Mr. Maassen had blamed ""radical-left forces"" in the coalition government for plotting his demotion from the intelligence post he held for six years. He made that statement last month in a speech to a group of European colleagues, but it was only in the last few days that transcripts of his remarks appeared in the German news media.The comments were ""unacceptable"" and ""crossed a line,"" and ""precluded trusting cooperation,"" Mr. Seehofer said in announcing on Monday afternoon that Mr. Maassen would be dismissed from government service.That did not quell criticism of Mr. Seehofer from political figures who said he should long ago have dismissed Mr. Maassen, whose words and actions prompted questions about whether Germany's intelligence apparatus could be counted on to police the far right. On Tuesday, there were calls for Mr. Seehofer's resignation from opposition lawmakers who sit on the parliamentary control committee, which oversees the country's intelligence agencies and is expected to discuss both the spy chief and the interior minister during its scheduled meeting later in the day.André Hahn, a Left party member, said that Mr. Seehofer posed ""a threat to democracy."" Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker of the Greens party, said that Mr. Seehofer ""had been untenable for months for several reasons,"" and compared the interior ministry to a rudderless ship, according to the German Press Agency.Mr. Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian conservatives who are a part of Ms. Merkel's coalition, had directly challenged her authority, trying to steer the government in a more anti-migrant direction and to fend off a challenge from the far-right party Alternative for Germany, known as AfD.Instead, his seeming inability to censure Mr. Maassen was one of the reasons voters gave for the severe losses suffered by the conservatives in regional elections in two states last month. A recent national opinion poll showed the alliance of Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats and Mr. Seehofer's Christian Social Union with the support of just 24.5 percent of the electorate, down from the 32.9 percent they won in last year's general election, and the 41.5 percent they won in 2013.Mr. Maassen had appeared to give cover to the right-wing demonstrators who rioted in Chemnitz, not only doubting the authenticity of the video but also questioning the chancellor's use of the word ""hounding"" to describe the mob's behavior.Mr. Maassen had already faced criticism for what was seen as improper contact with the AfD, after allegations that he had coached members of the party on how to avoid his agency's scrutiny.Rather than fire Mr. Maassen in September, Mr. Seehofer said he would promote him to the post of state secretary in his ministry, with a significant pay raise, but he reversed that decision in the face of widespread outrage. Instead, Mr. Seehofer set out to shift Mr. Maassen to a lesser ministry post, but this week he abandoned that plan.On Monday, Mr. Seehofer emphasized that his latest decision to let Mr. Maassen go signaled his willingness to advance the work of the governing coalition, which appears more fragile than ever since Ms. Merkel announced last week that she would give up her party's leadership in December and would not run for another term as chancellor.Thomas Haldenwang, previously a vice president of the domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, is to take over Mr. Maassen's duties until a permanent successor is appointed.In his leaked speech, Mr. Maassen presented himself as a victim of politics. He said that he was known as a ""critic of idealistic, naïve and left-wing policy on foreigners and security,"" and that this is why the news media and his opponents pushed him out of his job.He also hinted that he might be interested in going into politics, and at least one party jumped at the chance to embrace him. Jörg Meuthen, a senior member of the AfD, told the German daily Welt, ""We are a democratic constitutional party and Mr. Maassen would be very welcome in a democratic constitutional party.""Credit: CHRISTOPHER F.

1337,433692256.xml,"      Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, proposed a new way to help resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear program during an extraordinary meeting with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the country's chief nuclear negotiator on Wednesday. The negotiator, Ali Larijani, told reporters that Mr. Putin, who was granted an audience with Ayatollah Khamenei on Tuesday evening, ''offered a special proposal.'' Neither the Iranians nor the Russians would disclose any details, but Mr. Larijani said the Iranian side was studying it.   ''One of the issues he brought up was his view on the nuclear issue,'' Mr. Larijani said, according to the ISNA news agency. ''We are reviewing it now.''  State-run television and news agencies quoted Ayatollah Khamenei as telling Mr. Putin, ''We will think about what you said and about your proposal,'' even as he added that Iran was ''determined to provide our country's need for nuclear energy.'' Mr. Putin's visit highlighted the fact that Russia seems to be increasingly distancing itself from the United States and the Europeans on a strategy to curb Iran's nuclear program. While those nations have sought to impose new Security Council sanctions on Iran, the governments of Russia and China have resisted, arguing that more time is needed. Earlier, Moscow proposed to enrich uranium in Russia for use in Iranian reactors, assuring that Iran would not produce the highly enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons. Tehran rejected the idea as an impingement on its sovereignty. During his visit, which included a meeting with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Putin also warned the West against a military attack on Iran, stressing that Tehran had a right to peaceful nuclear energy. He also said that the Russian-built nuclear power plant at Bushehr, in southern Iran, where construction has been slowed by a dispute over payments, would be finished as scheduled. Underscoring the friendly nature of the visit, a joint statement spoke of ''the closeness of Russian and Iranian positions over the key world questions and the development of cooperation to establish a world order that is more just.'' It also stressed the need to solve the nuclear issue as quickly as possible ''through politics and diplomacy''; committed Russia to speed up discussions for the construction and sale of Tupolev 214 and Tupolev 334 airliners; and spoke of increased cooperation in energy and aerospace. Russia is eager to deepen its diplomatic and economic relations with Iran. Iran's Fars news service reported that Mr. Putin said during his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei that Russia was ready to ''expand ties without limitations.'' As Iran's most senior official, the ayatollah has final word on state matters, and his decision to see Mr. Putin was regarded as significant in itself. Even Mohamed ElBaradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, did not see Ayatollah Khamenei when he visited here last year. Mr. Putin has recently met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Russia and China hold veto power on the Security Council, and Iran is relying on both countries, which have important trade ties with Iran, to oppose another round of sanctions. Moscow has already voted for two sets of milder sanctions. The United States and European countries have said that they will impose tougher sanctions on Iran if it refuses to suspend its sensitive uranium enrichment activities. Mr. Larijani is scheduled to discuss Iran's nuclear case with Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, in Rome next Tuesday. An American official who was part of a delegation that visited the Kremlin last week suggested that Mr. Putin intimated in private that he had concerns about Iran's nuclear program as well. ''I will tell you that what we heard last week once the cameras left was not bad,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record. ''I cannot rule out that he delivered a message that we would like.'' He also said that the construction delays at Bushehr were not coincidental and were part of Russia's strategy of proceeding slowly with aid to Iran. In Jerusalem, Ms. Rice answered questions about Mr. Putin's visit to Iran by saying that Russia continued to back the diplomatic process to review the possibility of new sanctions following reports next month by Dr. ElBaradei and Mr. Solana. Russia, along with China, opposed a new round of sanctions at a meeting in New York last month. Neither Mr. Solana nor Dr. ElBaradei was informed by the Russians about Mr. Putin's proposal, officials in both their offices said. Ms. Rice discussed Iran extensively during meetings in Moscow last week, including one with Mr. Putin, who she said supported the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. ''I saw no evidence that Russia intends to do anything but stay on that path we laid out,'' she said, appearing with Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni. But clearly Russia has emerged as at least a semi-independent broker in the nuclear crisis. Just hours after Mr. Putin left Iran, Israel announced that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would visit Russia on Thursday for what one official described as a ''last-minute, urgent meeting.'' U.S. Ties Missile Shield to Iran BRUSSELS, Oct. 17 (Agence France-Presse) -- The United States could change its approach to developing a missile shield if Iran were to suspend uranium enrichment in its nuclear program, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday. The official, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, said that United States officials had explained Washington's stance to Russia in talks at NATO headquarters to help allay fears that the missile shield posed a threat to Russia. ''Our real concern is not Russia,'' Mr. Fried told reporters in Brussels. PHOTO: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met Tuesday with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

4227,433377593.xml,"      Reporters who covered W.'s 2000 campaign often wondered whether the Bush scion would give up acting the fool if he got to be the king. Would he stop playing peekaboo with his pre-meal moist towels during airplane interviews? Would he quit scrunching up his face and wiggling his eyebrows at memorial services? Would he replace levity and inanity with gravity?  ''In many regards, the Bush I knew did not seem to be built for what lay ahead,'' wrote Frank Bruni, the Times writer who covered W.'s ascent, in his book ''Ambling Into History.'' ''The Bush I knew was part scamp and part bumbler, a timeless fraternity boy and heedless cutup, a weekday gym rat and weekend napster, an adult with an inner child that often brimmed to the surface or burst through.'' The open-microphone incident at the G-8 lunch in St. Petersburg on Monday illustrated once more that W. never made any effort to adapt. The president has enshrined his immaturity and insularity, turning every environment he inhabits -- no matter how decorous or serious -- into a comfortable frat house. No matter what the trappings or the ceremonies require of the leader of the free world, he brings the same DKE bearing and cadences, the same insouciance and smart-alecky attitude, the same simplistic approach -- swearing, swaggering, talking to Tony Blair with his mouth full of buttered roll, and giving a startled Angela Merkel an impromptu shoulder rub. He can make even a global summit meeting seem like a kegger. Catching W. off-guard, the really weird thing is his sense of victimization. He's strangely resentful about the actual core of his job. Even after the debacles of Iraq and Katrina, he continues to treat the presidency as a colossal interference with his desire to mountain bike and clear brush. In snippets of overheard conversation, Mr. Bush says he has not bothered to prepare any closing remarks and grouses about having to listen to other world leaders talk too long. What did he think being president was about? The world may be blowing up, and the president may have a rare opportunity to jaw-jaw about bang-bang with his peers, but that pales in comparison with his burning desire to return to his feather pillow and gym back at the White House. ''Gotta go home,'' he tells the guy next to him. ''Got something to do tonight. Go to the airport, get on the airplane and go home.'' A White House spokesman said Mr. Bush had nothing on his schedule after he returned to Washington on Monday about 4 p.m. When he began meandering about how big Russia was, you expected him to yell, ''Yo, Condi!'' and ask his secretary of state: ''Hey, what's the name of that other big country that has more people than any other country in the world? It begins with a 'C.' Dad spent some time there.'' Perhaps it's that anti-patrician chip on his shoulder, his rebellion against a family that prized manners and diplomacy above all. But when bored or frustrated, W. reserves the right to be boorish -- no matter if the setting is a gilded palace or a Texas gorge. He treated Tony ''As It Were'' Blair like the servant in ''The Remains of the Day,'' blowing off his offer to help with the Israel-Lebanon crisis, and changing the subject from substance to fluff at one point, noting about his 60th-birthday Burberry gift: ''Thanks for the sweater. Awfully thoughtful of you.'' Then he razzed the British prime minister, who was hovering and wheedling like an abused wife: ''I know you picked it out yourself.'' After doing his best to undermine the U.N. and Kofi Annan, W. talked about the secretary general like a fraternity pledge he wanted to send out for more beer or a keg of Diet Coke: ''I felt like telling Kofi to get on the phone with Assad and make something happen.'' His loosey-goosey confidence that everything could be fixed with a phone call -- and not even a phone call made by him, and not even a phone call made to the Iranians, who have more control over Hezbollah -- was striking. He seems to have no clue that his own headlong, heedless actions in the Middle East have contributed to the deepening chaos there, and to Iran's growing influence and America's diminished leverage. Mr. Bush may resent the sophistication required of a president. But when the world is going to hell, he should stop chewing and start thinking.  ",2006-07-19
2222,1732212190.xml,"       BERLIN --  A growing sense that Afghanistan is slipping into greater chaos and will not stabilize anytime soon is driving rising numbers of Afghans to flee for Europe, hopeful that they will enjoy the same welcome given to Syrians and Iraqis seeking safety from war and terror. Aided by smugglers and worried that borders would soon close along the migrant trail through the Balkans, about 64,000 Afghans were registered entering Greece in October, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, second only to Syrians and more than double the 27,500 who were registered the month before. On a recent morning on the Greek island of Lesbos, a black rubber dinghy slid gently onto shore in the first light, and Hadi Atti, 17, a baby-faced high school student from a village outside Kabul, the Afghan capital, shouted: ""We are here! We are here!"" Mr. Atti said the crossing from Turkey was smooth but very cold. ""But we made it, and now we can continue on,"" he said. Where to? ""Germany!"" several of his travel companions shouted. ""Austria,"" one man said. ""I will go to Sweden,"" Mr. Atti said. But after a month of harrowing travel, rushing to reach Central and Northern Europe before more borders are closed, the Afghan migrants may be facing a new obstacle to their dreams of safety and security: a hardening stance by the German government on who gets to stay for a year, or more. German officials argue that Afghanistan is not universally unsafe, so not all migrants should be granted asylum. The interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, has said that applicants will be judged case by case, adding that ""not all of the people who come to us as refugees from Afghanistan can expect to stay in Germany."" Officials in Germany also note that the country has had troops in Afghanistan for 14 years and has poured more than 2 billion euros, or about $2.15 billion, into civilian projects. Chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested that those efforts fulfill Germany's commitment to care for those in need, meaning it should not necessarily have to shelter Afghans in Germany, too. That tougher stance by Germany is emerging as the biggest test case yet of Central and Northern Europe's willingness to absorb people from the world's most troubled regions. At the same time, it may force a debate over who qualifies as a refugee. ""Life in Afghanistan is worsening, and the fighting is increasing,"" Mr. Atti said. ""There is the Taliban. There is ISIS. It is very bad,"" he added, referring to the militant group also known as the Islamic State or ISIL. Germany's own Foreign Ministry ""urgently warns"" against travel to Afghanistan. Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, said that some of the Afghan migrants might be leaving for a better life in Europe's most prosperous countries, but that for many, ""it is well documented that these are extremely dangerous situations"" that they face living in Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries on earth. At the same time, Afghanistan's sophisticated networks of smugglers appear to have accelerated their operations, capitalizing on growing fears over advances by the Taliban and inroads by the Islamic State. About 67,000 Afghans have entered Germany seeking asylum this year, almost half of them last month alone, officials said. Mr. de Maizière, the interior minister, has said the arrival of so many members of Afghanistan's middle class is ""unacceptable."" ""We are in agreement with the Afghan government,"" he said, of concerns that Afghanistan's population would be depleted of future leaders. ""We do not want that."" Afghan migrants in Germany said they were already feeling the effects of the government's harder line. On Thursday, Sayed Aliraza, 24, was among the thousands of new arrivals waiting in Berlin's main migrant reception center, hoping to appeal what he said had been his rejection from German-language classes. Mr. Aliraza said he had broken off his studies of law and politics in his third year at Kabul University and left for Europe in April with his parents, brother, sister-in-law and their five children. He said he was in his third day of seeking redress from a Berlin bureaucracy severely strained by the migrant influx, to present a paper he said showed approval to start the classes. He said the government, which insists newcomers learn German, was no longer helping Afghans. ""I think the German government does not want for Afghan people to learn Deutsch,"" he said. ""I understand -- the government of Germany doesn't have place for refugees. But we are also human."" ""We don't have any security there,"" he added, referring to Afghanistan. ""That is the reality. Afghanistan is not secure, and the government of Germany knows this."" The unwelcome message does not appear to have fully trickled into Afghanistan itself, although migrants arriving in Greece last week expressed a growing sense that they had more to worry about than the possible closing of borders or the hardships of travel. ""I have been told that Germany will only accept you if you are under the age of 18,"" Sayed Mohammed, 28, said in Lesbos last week. ""Do you know if that is true?"" There is no age limit on German admissions, although several of the Afghans on Lesbos seemed to know of special programs for minors in Germany and claimed to be under 18, though many looked older. Mr. Mohammed paid $3,000 to a series of smugglers who guided him from Kabul to Iran, on into Turkey, and finally across the sea to Lesbos, he said. He had been on the road for 30 days. As a Hazara, a Shiite Muslim ethnic minority targeted by the Taliban, who are Sunni, Mr. Mohammed had been threatened many times, he said. ""The Taliban would have killed me if I remained, I am certain of it,"" he said. His dream, he said, is Germany, but he will try Sweden instead. After more than four years of war in Syria and a recent bombing campaign by Russia in support of President Bashar al-Assad, more Syrians than Afghans continue to enter Greece, though the pace from Syria has dropped slightly. In September, 110,512 Syrians entered Greece, according to the Hellenic Coast Guard, but the tally decreased to 90,718 in October. Over the same period, the number of Afghans more than doubled to 64,000, according to the United Nations. After 35 years of war, Afghanistan is a leading source of refugees. Afghans began arriving in Europe in significant numbers as the Taliban took hold in the 1990s, and in 2001 they were the single largest group arriving on the Continent, according to the United Nations refugee group. The International Organization for Migration estimated that 260,000 Afghans were on the Continent from 2010 to 2012. And because Afghanistan is also the world's leading opium producer, finding a smuggler is easy. They are waiting at border crossings to Iran, where busloads of Afghan migrants arrive daily to begin a journey they hope will end in Europe. Or one can get a referral to a smuggler at Kabul's pre-eminent mall. Germany's hardening stance on the Afghan migrants comes as discontent over the open-door migration policy of Ms. Merkel's government deepens. The giddy joy that greeted the migrants when they started pouring into rail stations in early September is giving way to a dreary exhaustion as cities and towns struggle to accommodate thousands of people who do not share a common culture, language or religion -- and who must be protected before the winter sets in. Under political pressure, the government has tightened some of its policies, adopting measures to weed out new arrivals who are unlikely to qualify for asylum and limiting asylum-seekers' ability to bring additional family members. Mr. de Maizière, who bore the brunt of the criticism for being unprepared for the migrants' arrival, has raised the issue of the Afghan migrants several times in recent weeks. His criticisms appear to have taken hold in German society, highlighted by a recent article in the mass-circulation newspaper Bild that raised questions about Afghans' claims of personal danger, a condition of asylum. Bild said its reporter had found fake Taliban death sentences, meant to reinforce false claims of personal threat, selling for [euro]1,000 in Kabul. Germany is balking at looking after Afghans on both ends. Since German troops were first deployed to Afghanistan in 2001, in post-9/11 solidarity with the United States, 54 German soldiers have been killed, the biggest toll of any German deployment abroad since 1945. Noting that American, German and other forces will now stay beyond 2016, Ms. Merkel has argued that that commitment -- as well as more aid -- can give Afghans ""more possibility to build up their country.""  Mohamed al Zoda, 20, a Hazara from Baghlan Province at the main migrant center in Berlin, said he did not buy Ms. Merkel's argument. ""The case here is that our government is bribed,"" he said, sitting among a group of young Afghan men at the center last week. ""They are not good guys."" ""Foreign countries give aid,"" he added, but the government ""gets the money and put it in their pocket."" ""They do not have any solutions for people,"" he said.

2355,1519015528.xml,"       BERLIN --  With the showdown over Ukraine escalating and President Obama warning Moscow of a tough new round of sanctions, Russia and its allies in the European private sector are conducting a separate campaign to ensure that they can maintain their deep and longstanding economic ties even if the Kremlin orders further military action. European banks and businesses are far more exposed to the Russian economy than are their American counterparts. Trade between the European Union and Russia amounted to almost $370 billion in 2012, while United States trade with Russia was about $26 billion that year. As a result, they have lobbied energetically to head off or at least dilute any sanctions, making it hard for American and European political leaders to come up with a package of measures with enough bite to influence Moscow's behavior in Ukraine. Since Russia's annexation of Crimea, energy companies, exporters, big users of Russian natural gas and investors with stakes in Russia have counseled caution. ""Neither in energy terms, nor politically, should we turn away from Russia,"" said Rainer Seele, the chairman of Wintershall, a subsidiary of the large German-based chemical company BASF that is deeply entwined in Russia's oil and natural gas trade. Russia is already paying a price for its foreign policy, experts say, with capital leaving the country and the ruble falling steadily, causing the government to raise interest rates. Its government bonds were downgraded on Friday to near junk status by Standard & Poor's in the latest indication that its economy is already under growing pressure.  In a statement on Friday, the White House said Mr. Obama had discussed Ukraine with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President François Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. Mr. Obama said only that the leaders had ""agreed to work closely together, and through the G-7 and European Union, to coordinate additional steps to impose costs on Russia,"" and European governments, without being specific, signaled that they were ready to take some kind of action. On Friday evening, a senior Obama administration official said sanctions against more Russian individuals could be announced as early as Monday. Two Western officials said that the European Union would impose sanctions against 15 Russians. And late Friday night, the White House released a statement from the Group of 7, which said: ""We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia. ""Given the urgency of securing the opportunity for a successful and peaceful democratic vote next month in Ukraine's presidential elections,"" the statement added, ""we have committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of Russia's actions.""  The phone discussion among the leaders came at the end of a week in which executives of the giant Russian gas company, Gazprom, stumped across the European capitals, rallying support from customers and suppliers against increased tensions and making the case that Russia and Europe were long-term economic partners who should not let temporary crises cut their ties. Gazprom is 50 percent owned by the Russian government. ""Sanctions will not help anybody, they would not just hurt Russia, but also Germany and Europe as a whole,"" Mr. Seele of Wintershall has said. Alexander Medvedev, the No. 2 at Gazprom, said that his company had done everything possible to keep gas flowing to both Ukraine and Europe, but that the time of a financial reckoning was near, alluding to the $18.5 billion that he said Ukraine owed. How, he asked, can a publicly traded company like Gazprom keep contractual promises and make needed investments with such a cash shortfall from a slippery customer? Perhaps, he suggested, Ukraine's Western friends would like to help meet these bills.  About a quarter of the European Union's gas supplies originate in Russia. More than half of Russia's exports go to the European Union, and 45 percent of its imports come from the European Union, according to European statistics. The pace at which the Ukraine crisis is changing the economics and geopolitics of Europe became clear again on Friday when Ms. Merkel endorsed a suggestion from Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland for a common energy policy for the 28-nation European Union. But even the general embrace of the idea by Germany suggests that European Union countries might be prepared to pull together with the kind of unified response that Russia and Russian businesses fear could lead to Moscow's isolation. No European industry has been as open in its support of Russia as the energy industry. Executives have publicly voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of sanctions, lobbied behind the scenes to head them off and traveled to Russia, on at least one occasion to pose with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin. And the Russians, while publicly playing down the effects of sanctions, have been trying to exert influence in Brussels and elsewhere, lobbyists said. In an interview on Friday, Gerhard Roiss, the chief executive of the Austrian oil and gas supplier OMV, which has been working with Gazprom for five decades, said, ""You cannot talk about sanctions if you don't know the outcome of sanctions."" ""Europe has developed over the last 50 years into a region where we have a division of labor and a division of resources, and this means in concrete terms that energy is imported from Russia and products -- automotive or machinery -- are exported from European countries into Russia,"" he added. Mr. Roiss met with Gazprom's chief executive this week and reaffirmed their business ties. He pointed out that this was hardly the first political crisis the sides had faced. The year Russian gas first started flowing into Austria, 1968, was the same year the Soviets invaded the former Czechoslovakia. ""We've had a crisis situation several times, but if you see it over the 50 years, natural gas was not used as a weapon, and we should not use gas as a weapon,"" he said. Before the call between the European leaders and Mr. Obama, Ms. Merkel called Mr. Putin in what appeared to be a last warning to fulfill the accord reached in Geneva last week to reduce tensions in Ukraine. Minutes later, a Kremlin statement put a different spin on the call, saying that both Mr. Putin and Ms. Merkel had called for three-party talks on Russian gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine. Whether that was an indication that Mr. Putin now feared that tough sanctions loom -- sanctions that Western leaders argue would inflict more harm on Russia's heavily oil- and gas-dependent economy than on Europe -- was not clear. Mr. Medvedev's tour of Europe, and what he said was constant contact with the European Union's energy commissioner, Guenter Oettinger, suggested that Russian business was very worried about losing what it has carefully built. Do not forget, Mr. Medvedev urged Europe, that Gazprom has for decades -- right through the Cold War and multiple East-West crises -- been a reliable supplier. It has no intention of leaving customers in the lurch now. ""We are not planning to cut gas to Ukraine,"" Mr. Medvedev said. ""We just would like to receive payment for the gas that we are going to deliver."" In 2006 and especially 2009, when Ukraine and Russia were locked in disputes over natural gas prices, European customers experienced delivery shortfalls for which Gazprom blamed Ukraine's siphoning of supplies intended for Europe to meet its own domestic needs. ""There never were, are not and won't be plans to cut"" delivery, Mr. Medvedev said of the current situation. For one thing, he added, ""we are too much dependent on the cash flow from Europe."" Russian business -- not to mention rich Russians who have eagerly bought property everywhere from London to France, Berlin and the Czech spa city of Karlovy Vary -- is now not just embedded in the energy supply and financial markets of Europe. As any soccer fan could see in the Champions League matches this week, Gazprom is a main sponsor of the sport in Europe. Whether that has bought much independence from the image of the Russian government is questionable. Pressure has risen markedly on German business since Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, met Mr. Putin in late March. Mr. Kaeser was not admonished outright, but Ms. Merkel had a distinctly frosty face for him two days later when both attended a signing of new contracts with China. BP has a 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil giant. ""We're monitoring the situation, and clearly we're committed to our investment in Russia,"" said Toby Odone, a BP spokesman. ""People keep asking us to speculate what would happen if such and such a sanction were imposed, and we're not going to do that. As things stand, our interests in Russia have not been affected by the measures that have so far been imposed."" Mr. Roiss said he had spoken to officials ""on the European level and on the national level."" ""This is not an issue of lobbying, it's an issue of saying what you think,"" he said. ""My feedback from talking to politicians, wherever they are, is that people see that this is quite a broad issue, that one should not really mix too much into politics.""

3059,2221094151.xml,"BERLIN -- Germany's health minister has proposed a fine of up to 2,500 euros, or about $2,800, for parents who refuse to immunize their school-age children against measles, part of efforts to combat a disease that has surged after decades of decline.The fine is part of a draft bill that the minister, Jens Spahn, submitted to Chancellor Angela Merkel's government for debate this week, but the proposal has prompted a wider discussion about whether mandating vaccinations is an infringement on personal freedom. Germany has seen 300 cases of the disease already this year, after more than 500 cases in 2018.Outbreaks of measles have increased around the world, in part because of the anti-vaccination movement.Under the proposed draft, toddlers and young children in Germany who have not been immunized would not be allowed to enter preschool. But German law mandates school attendance starting at age 6, so parents whose children have not had their scheduled shots would face a fine.Mr. Spahn has defended his proposal by drawing a parallel to traffic laws that force drivers who are caught speeding to pay a fine because their actions are a danger to others. ""The goal is not to fine people, the goal is to ensure that people are immunized,"" he said in an interview with the broadcaster ZDF on Monday.""We have been having this debate every few months over the past 10, 20 years,"" Mr. Spahn said. ""Whenever there is an outbreak and children or students have to be kept away from lessons, everyone says we could, we should do something -- but not enough happens.""Under the proposed bill, which would be put to Parliament later this year and take effect in the first part of 2020 if approved, adults working in schools, hospitals and other public institutions would also be required to show proof of up-to-date immunizations.Germany has seen measles outbreaks in several states recently, including Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, concentrated largely around schools. In the United States, where the largest outbreaks have hit Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, more than 700 measles cases have been recorded so far this year, more than in any full year since 1994, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Worldwide, there were more than 112,000 reported cases in the first three months of this year, according to the World Health Organization, nearly four times as many as in the same period a year earlier, and the organization says there are far more unreported cases.Germany has used information campaigns to encourage people, especially parents, to make sure they and their children are immunized, but Mr. Spahn said the outbreaks in recent years showed that those efforts were not effective enough.Germany had pledged to eradicate measles by 2015, but studies by a national health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, showed that only 93 percent of first graders had sufficient immunity against the disease in 2017. Immunity is reached through an initial vaccination, usually given at around age 1, followed several months later by a booster shot.According to the World Health Organization, 95 percent of a population must be immunized to inoculate society as a whole against the virus, and that includes infants too young to be vaccinated.Measles is extremely contagious. It has a very low death rate in developed countries, but it can cause severe complications like blindness and seizures. In poorer parts of the world, where malnutrition and dehydration weaken the body's response, it is much more likely to be lethal.It kills about 100,000 people annually, according to the W.H.O., including 72 in Europe last year.Follow Melissa Eddy on Twitter:                           @meddynyt                        .",2019-05-08
1818,1864989615.xml,"SOFIA, Bulgaria -- With one foot in the West and the other in the East, Bulgaria has long engaged in a delicate balancing act.But now the country, and its new president, Rumen Radev, will have to learn how to balance Donald J. Trump and an increasingly energized Vladimir V. Putin.
Mr. Radev contemplated his new role as balancer in chief two days before he was sworn in on Jan. 19, sitting across the street from the presidential palace in the labyrinthine former headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party.
""We have a clear road map to follow,"" Mr. Radev said. ""Staying in the E.U. and staying in NATO. But at the same time, we have a deep historical relationship with Russia.""
Countries like Bulgaria have spent decades balancing East and West, and playing one off the other. But the prospect of President Trump's moving closer to Mr. Putin has scrambled that strategy, as have the conflicting messages coming out of the new American administration.
Mr. Trump has seemed eager for closer Kremlin ties, even echoing Moscow's disdain for NATO and the European Union. But last week, his new ambassador echoed the Obama administration's harder line, saying the United States would not withdraw sanctions against Russia until the country pulled its troops out of Crimea.
At the same time, Mr. Putin has been showing new signs of swagger in his dealings with Russia's neighbors; on Thursday he arrived in Hungary for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era.
Bulgaria is an eager member of the European Union, but as rising nationalism caused support for the union to wane, here and elsewhere, Russian influence has crept in. On the surface, this suggests that Mr. Trump's outreach to Moscow, if genuine, would be good for Bulgaria -- and, indeed, nationalists are thrilled.
But Bulgaria has also known so many betrayals and occupations that this sudden lurch has inspired as much worry as elation, including fears that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will forge a bargain between themselves that serves their two nations but carves up the region into spheres of influence, just as the major powers did at the end of World War II.
For many reasons, including economic necessity, a common culture and deep historical ties, Bulgarian politicians, including the president, want closer relations with Russia, but not so close that their nation loses its cherished ties to the West and falls firmly into Russia's orbit.
It is unclear whether Bulgaria's old balancing act will work in the emerging international order. Indeed, similar calculations are being made throughout Central and Eastern Europe as leaders wait to see what Mr. Trump has in mind.
It was the subtext of the meeting in Budapest last week between Mr. Putin and Hungary's autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, at which the two expressed the desire for friendly relations but did not mention sticky issues like the Crimean sanctions.
For Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union and the one with the deepest ties to Russia, the ride has been a particularly turbulent one.
After the initial euphoria over the collapse of Communism and membership in the European Union in 2007 and NATO in 2004, disappointments followed. The slow pace of economic growth, persistent corruption, domineering oligarchs and a dependence on Russian oil and gas caused many politicians in Bulgaria and elsewhere to pivot eastward. A growing number of populists and nationalists found much to admire in Mr. Putin's autocratic approach.
When Bulgaria was accepted into the European Union, the country turned westward with great zeal. Money poured in from Brussels. Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians seized the chance to move to Britain, Germany and elsewhere. But the growing ambivalence about the union was apparent as recently as last month when the 10th anniversary of Bulgaria's entrance into the union passed with barely any public celebration or notice.
Now pro-Western voices are on the defensive in Bulgaria, and the tenor of national politics has shifted in a more Russia-friendly way. How confusion over Mr. Trump's actual intentions toward Moscow will affect that dynamic remains to be seen. Mr. Trump's manner of talking has already emboldened nationalists and populists throughout Central and Eastern Europe -- including Mr. Orban and Milos Zeman, the Czech Republic's president -- to sharpen their own talk and offer the Kremlin an even friendlier hand, even as many analysts warn against creeping influence from Russia.
""The more you go to the East, the more you see more authoritarian systems and more corrupt practices,"" said Ognyan Minchev, executive director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies and a professor of political science at the University of Sofia. ""If it is not guarded, it will erode, and this process will move to the West. It is a battle, and it is a battle for a region that is historically defined as no man's land.""
A big question hanging over the European Union this year is how much Mr. Putin will try to influence critical elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands -- as well as in less prominent contests like November's vote to replace a Czech Parliament that has remained firmly pro-Western despite its president's friendliness toward Mr. Putin.
""The pro-Europeans are in retreat. In the coming year, Merkel may fall,"" said Ruslan Stefanov, director of the economic program at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. ""The Netherlands may leave the union. Italy. France. It's a brave new world.""
Historical and cultural ties between Russia and Bulgaria are deeply emotional, one reason that pro-Moscow sentiment is gathering political momentum.
""Improving relations with Russia is good for Bulgaria, the United States and the world,"" said Nikolai Malinov, the chairman of the National Movement of Russophiles, founded in 2003. ""When you are banging weapons, or imposing sanctions, it is not good. We have to heal those wounds.""
Mr. Malinov's group, which claims 35,000 members, describes itself as a cultural organization, staging concerts, maintaining monuments to Bulgaria's past with Russia, erecting monuments and pushing for more Russian-language training.
In Bulgaria, the president acts as head of state and commander in chief of the military, but most political power resides with the prime minister. Boyko Borissov, who took a slightly more pro-Western tilt but also strongly favored close ties with Moscow, stepped down as prime minister after Mr. Radev's victory.
Mr. Radev had 20 opponents in his race for president, said Ivo Indzhev, a pro-Western journalist. Just one, he said, explicitly echoed the trans-Atlantic alliance's language toward sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Crimea. Yet the paradox of this eastward shift is the growing anxiety that Bulgaria could become a geopolitical bargaining chip.
""This is nothing new for Eastern Europe, to be part of a game plan that is reminiscent of Yalta,"" said Ilian Vassilev, Bulgarian ambassador to Russia from 2000 to 2006. ""President Trump can do whatever he wants to do within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution, but he cannot replace the feeling Eastern Europeans have that they are being betrayed. A deal is going on over their heads.""
Bulgaria has a stubborn culture of corruption and oligarchic control, which the Kremlin has been adept at exploiting in service of expanding its influence.
The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Sofia-based Center for the Study of Democracy released a study in October. Called ""The Kremlin Playbook,"" it characterized Bulgaria as the most deeply penetrated by Russia financially. Investment with Russian roots, direct and indirect, accounts for more than 22 percent of Bulgaria's gross domestic product, marking the country as a ""captured state,"" said the study, of which Mr. Stefanov was an author.
Increasing Russian penetration was also found in Slovakia, Latvia, Serbia and Hungary.
""In one way or another, all of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have become captured states of the oligarchic network which emerged from the old security services of the Communist regimes,"" Dr. Minchev said in an interview. ""They went underground and re-emerged as this new, so-called business elite.""
Peter Kreko, a Hungarian political analyst and visiting professor in the central Eurasian studies department at Indiana University, thinks the talk of friendlier relations between Washington and Moscow is already having an impact on European nationalists.
""Definitely, it's seen as a green light for populist and nationalist leaders across Europe to accelerate their moves toward Russia,"" Dr. Kreko said.
But he thinks those leaders -- who see the Euro-Atlantic alliance and its emphasis on democracy and human rights as threats to their power -- are fooling themselves if they believe that a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will benefit them.
""If there is a big deal, if there is a big bargain, will they play any role in that?"" Dr. Kreko said. ""I don't think so.""
The larger worry, he and other analysts said, is that such a grand bargain would propel Mr. Putin's goal of again declaring spheres of influence between East and West -- resulting in a reduced American presence in the region and a greater Russian one.
""For those of us who have always believed the U.S. is a beacon of hope, it is a shock,"" Mr. Vassilev said. ""The most pro-American guys in Bulgaria are turning against America because they cannot tell the difference between Putin and Trump.""

Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary withdrew his party from the center-right grouping in the European Parliament, heading off a move to expel them over democratic backsliding at home. (Sergey Ponomarev/The New York Times)


BRUSSELS — For years, Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orban, has clashed with the European Union as he steadily eroded democracy in his country, but time and again, an alliance of conservative European political parties has shielded him from serious penalties.
On Wednesday, he lost that shield.
Relations between Orban and the center-right group, the European People’s Party, had become increasingly frayed as he grew more authoritarian, and the alliance had signaled that it might finally expel him. But Orban jumped first Wednesday, pulling his Fidesz party out of the group.
Membership in the grouping has given Orban and Fidesz clout and a degree of legitimacy within Europe. The party includes mainstream conservatives such as the Christian Democrats of Germany, the Republicans of France and Forza Italia in Italy, and is the strongest faction in the European Parliament.
No longer having to provide cover for him could spell some relief for the center-right grouping. Some European conservatives have long complained that accommodating Orban meant compromising their principles and enabling him and what he called his “illiberal state.”
Isolation from powerful EU allies who have long protected him from harsher punishment for his anti-democratic backsliding could cost Hungary desperately needed EU funds. His government hopes to receive billions in EU coronavirus-recovery stimulus funds, which have been tied to adherence to the rule of law.
But Orban could spin his decision to withdraw from the European People’s Party as an act of political bravery, hoping to energize his image as a European renegade at home, where he faces his most serious crisis since he took office in 2010.
Hungary’s health care system is straining under the weight of a coronavirus pandemic that is raging largely unchecked, the economy in tatters and the opposition has banded together for the first time to take on Orban in elections that are scheduled for next year.
In European politics, it is not yet clear whether Orban and Fidesz will make an alliance with any other nationalist, populist or far-right groups, like Italy’s League party.
As Orban has eliminated the independence of Hungary’s judiciary and much of its media, targeted civil society groups, stifled dissent and pushed back refugees from war-torn Syria, pressure grew within the European People’s Party to ostracize him.
The group suspended Fidesz in 2019, and recently changed its rules in a way that would make it easier to expel a member. It was set to vote on whether to expel Fidesz at its next in-person meeting, which has not yet to been scheduled, it said in a statement.
In a letter announcing the withdrawal of Fidesz, Orban said that at a time when countries were battling the coronavirus, the European People’s Party “is paralyzed by its inner administrative issues” and was “trying to mute” Hungarian deputies.
Manfred Weber, the alliance’s leader in the European Parliament, said it was a “sad day” for the grouping and thanked departing Fidesz members for their contributions. But he blamed “ongoing attacks” by Orban against the European Union and the rule of law in Hungary for the rupture.
For now, the move is largely symbolic and political, rather than practical.
Even without Fidesz’s 12 members, the European People’s Party remains the largest in the European Parliament, and Fidesz's delegates will not lose any rights in the assembly.
The long breakup between Orban and the center-right grouping highlights how mutually beneficial the relationship had been.
Europe’s mainstream conservatives have long been reluctant to act decisively against Orban, as they have tilted to the right, wary of challenges from rising far-right parties.
Fidesz has provided votes for their bloc, which has in turn supported, or at least tolerated, Orban as he methodically dismantled democratic institutions at home.
For Orban, membership in the European People’s Party has lost some appeal, as the access it has long afforded him to allies is waning.

He is set to lose his key ally in the group, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will soon be stepping down. Analysts say Orban has calculated he would be unlikely to enjoy a close relationship with whoever follows Merkel, so the grouping would no longer be as useful to him.
This alliance between Orban and Merkel has benefited both sides, said R. Daniel Kelemen, professor of European politics at Rutgers University. “Mr. Orban gets political protection and legitimacy,” he said, “and Mrs. Merkel gets votes for her policy agenda in the European Parliament from Mr. Orban’s delegates, as well as preferential treatment for German companies in Hungary.”
As a result, “alliances that would be deemed unacceptable at the national level happen routinely at the EU level,” he said.
“Merkel’s party would never ally with the far-right or any authoritarian party within Germany,” he said. “But it is perfectly happy to ally with Orban’s authoritarian party at the EU level, mostly because German voters don’t realize this is happening.”

While Orban was embraced by then-President Donald Trump, the Biden administration has criticized his policies in Hungary.
Orban’s undermining of Hungary’s democratic institutions has led prominent watchdogs to say the country is no longer a democracy, often blaming Europe’s conservatives for enabling him.
In 2015, when more than a million refugees fled to Europe seeking safety from Syria, Orban built a fence along Hungary’s borders and imposed draconian penalties against those seeking asylum in the country.
Orban’s stance drew support from those in the EU who saw the arrival of refugees as a threat to the bloc.
But many European conservatives also spoke out against Orban.
“This is not the Middle Ages,” said Frank Engel, head of Luxembourg’s Christian Social People’s Party, a member party of the center-right grouping. “This is the 21st century. European Christian civilization is perfectly capable of defending itself without Mr. Orban erecting his fences.”

389,2448154175.xml,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of the European Commission agreed that the two sides shared enough common ground to aim for a final settlement.LONDON -- Britain's lengthy divorce proceedings with the European Union entered a make-or-break phase on Saturday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission president agreed that the two sides shared enough common ground to aim for a final settlement.The announcement, after a video call between Mr. Johnson and the Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, fell well short of a breakthrough, but neither was it a breakdown. Negotiations for a long-term trade agreement, which have ground on inconclusively for months, will now intensify as the two sides scramble to meet a deadline that would allow a deal to be in place on Dec. 31.The two leaders agreed that ""progress had been made in recent weeks but that significant gaps remained,"" according to a statement from 10 Downing Street. ""They instructed their chief negotiators to work intensively in order to try to bridge those gaps.""Britain formally left the European Union at the end of January. But under the terms of its withdrawal agreement, it remains part of the bloc's customs union and single market until the end of the year while the two sides hammer out permanent arrangements on issues like fishing quotas and state aid to industries.While the issues in dispute are technical and even at times tedious, they have profound implications for Britain's future relationship with the European Union. The risk of a rupture is as big as it was this time last year, when negotiations on the withdrawal agreement hit a similar moment of truth.Mr. Johnson's intervention in the talks is an important, if long-expected, shift from working-level negotiators to top leaders. In addition to the prime minister and Ms. von der Leyen, much will depend on the role played by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France.Each has very different political calculations. Mr. Macron's polling numbers have swooned in recent weeks as French voters increasingly disapprove of his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He faces an election next year, which raises questions about how much ground he will be willing to give Britain on politically sensitive issues like fishing rights.Ms. Merkel, in the twilight of her long tenure, has her eye firmly on securing her legacy as the de facto leader of Europe. A bitter breakup with Britain, especially when Germany holds the presidency of the European Council -- the bloc's executive arm -- would mar that record and she seems determined to avoid that outcome.""You see that now with Merkel still being very cautious but constructive, and the Macron team being far more aggressive and even hostile toward the U.K.,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, a former economist at the European Commission who is now an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.Yet even Ms. Merkel has shown impatience with what many in Europe perceive as Britain's needlessly provocative tactics.Mr. Johnson recently introduced a bill that would override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland. His own aides acknowledged that it would be a violation of international law, and the European Union bought legal action against Britain this past week.""We've suffered a certain setback with the breaching of the agreement we reached on Northern Ireland,"" Ms. Merkel said on Friday in language that, for her, was more frank than usual. ""I have to say simply: That's bitter.""With time running out, the British have been pressing for an opportunity to take their case higher up the political food chain. Last year, Mr. Johnson successfully brokered an agreement on Britain's withdrawal in talks with Leo Varadkar, Ireland's prime minister at the time, and seems confident that he can do so again.Things are harder this time, however.The most contentious points in last year's withdrawal agreement mainly affected a single country, Ireland, while these negotiations on trade affect many more. The big economies, like France and Germany, have much at stake, and red lines they will not cross.Among the main sticking points are fisheries, with most analysts saying that to get a deal, the European Union would have to accept lower quotas for catches in British waters. The new quotas could be phased in, however, giving continental fishing fleets more time to adjust.At the same, Britain would have to give ground on the thorny issue of state aid.The European Union fears that an unfettered British government could subsidize its companies and dump goods in the continental European market. The bloc wants the British to specify which antitrust rules it will enforce domestically, and to agree on a mechanism to resolve disputes with the E.U.Britain, however, sees it as a matter of national sovereignty. Mr. Johnson's powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings, wants Britain to have a free hand to promote artificial intelligence and other the high-tech industries.Yet the pandemic has heightened pressure on Mr. Johnson to compromise.Not only has the British economy taken a big hit, but his handling of the pandemic has been widely criticized. With lawmakers in his own Conservative Party increasingly rebellious, Mr. Johnson would run an acute political risk if he allowed the absence of a Brexit trade deal to produce chaos at Channel ports in January.In interviews with the BBC on Saturday before his call with Ms. von der Leyen, Mr. Johnson struck a more optimistic tone then he has in recent weeks, when he talked openly about a no-deal Brexit.The ingredients for a deal were ""all there,"" though he added, ""It's up to our friends and partners to be common-sensical.""Mr. Rahman said he expected more fireworks in the weeks to come, and he did not rule out a collapse in the talks. But he predicted that in the end, Mr. Johnson would compromise to get an agreement.""The world around him is melting down, and he needs a win on Brexit,"" Mr. Rahman said.Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Brussels.With time running out for a Brexit deal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is increasingly involved.

899,433924027.xml,"      The United States, having expanded its proposed rescue of the financial sector to include foreign banks, has not yet found any other country willing to join the landmark bailout.   The Treasury Department still hopes to marshal a worldwide effort to cleanse the balance sheets of banks. But Europe and Japan have signaled that they are not ready to mount a rescue of the kind being debated here.   Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. continues to solicit support from foreign governments. His department plans to prod them by giving preference to banks from countries that show a willingness to help the American effort, a senior administration official said Monday.   ""We expect other countries to do their part, but we're not insisting their programs be exactly like ours,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We're certainly not prepared to put ourselves in a position where there's a free-rider problem.""   Given that the mortgage collapse  began here and that most of the distressed debt is held by American banks, specialists  said it was not clear that the United States had much leverage in forcing others to take part.   ""There's a view in Europe that this is a U.S.-made problem, and that it should be solved in the U.S.,"" said Charles H. Dallara, the managing director of the Institute for International Finance, a group of more than 300  global banks.   Several  banks raised concerns after a draft of the rescue plan limited eligibility for selling mortgage-related loans to the Treasury to banks with headquarters in the United States. The language was changed a day later to include foreign banks with significant American operations.   The change did not reflect lobbying pressure, officials said, but Mr. Paulson's judgment that helping all banks with contacts to American consumers would better stabilize financial markets.   It did not, however, build support for a bailout in Europe, a day after finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 industrialized countries discussed the proposal in a conference call.   While the group pledged in a statement to ""enhance international cooperation,"" it affirmed that the countries were free to go their own way in responding to the crisis. ""None of the other six G-7 members will adopt a similar program to the U.S.,""  the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, said.   The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, criticized the United States and Britain for opposing German attempts to put greater regulation, or at least reviews, of the financial sector on the international agenda last year, when she was leading the Group of 7.   ""Everyone who produces a real product knows what it looks like and what standards it is up to,"" Mrs. Merkel said, while traveling in Austria. ""One also needs to know with a financial product what's involved. Otherwise, these sorts of things happen that we then all have to pay for.""   In fact, Germany and Britain have already bailed out some banks that got into trouble because of deteriorating mortgage-related loans, though on a scale much smaller than the proposed American plan.   British officials made clear that they would not create a government fund to buy bad assets, although Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, did promise new rules.   ""We are putting in place both here in the U.K. and internationally the tougher financial regulation no one can doubt we need,"" Mr. Darling told the governing Labor Party's annual conference in Manchester. ""I will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain financial stability.""   Some economists said Europeans would be forced to take more sweeping action. ""Germany has more toxic exposure than any other country,"" said Adam S. Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""The only one that may stay out of this is France.""   President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who holds the rotating European Union presidency, has on many occasions complained about the structure of global economic regulation.   On Monday, Christian de Boissieu, chairman of the French prime minister's council of economic analysis, said: ""The U.S. must take charge of the budgetary costs of the crisis. I'm all for trans-Atlantic solidarity, but this doesn't include financing the bailout.""   The Japanese finance minister, Bunmei Ibuki, said after the Group of 7 statement that he saw no need for Japan to set up an American-style rescue scheme to help its own banks rid themselves of bad assets, Reuters reported.   Apart from a lack of sympathy for a crisis they view as made in America, European governments are also constrained by rules within the 27-nation European Union that limit budget deficits and public debt.   ""Europe won't do anything because they haven't got the room for maneuver,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an equity strategist with Charles Stanley in London. ""They ran themselves into a cul-de-sac.""   A study by the Federal Reserve in August concluded that losses of foreigners holding mortgage-backed securities could be as low as $75 billion, though paper losses would be higher before the market stabilizes.   The Association of German Banks hinted that it would oppose the bailout plan if it gave American rivals a sudden advantage.   ""We need to assure that disadvantages for foreign institutions do not arise from the U.S. program,""  Manfred Weber, the general manager of the association, said. ""It was, after all, American products that created the crisis and that created the contagion effects.""   A spokesman for the association, Heiner Herkenhoff, said the group was still studying the details of the plan, such as they were available, but that it should define eligibility through the nationality of the product. If the mortgage-linked security in question was from the United States, he said, it should be eligible to be purchased, no matter which bank held it.   That appears to conflict with the plan to limit eligibility to foreign banks with significant American operations. Such a rule would include major banks like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, but many of Germany's smaller banks did not meet that criterion, Mr. Herkenhoff said.

1956,577123548.xml,"      BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's handpicked presidential candidate limped to victory after three rounds of voting by a special assembly on Wednesday, a weak showing that deeply damaged her political fortunes.   What should have been a rubber-stamp victory for the candidate, Christian Wulff, instead turned into a daylong battle as rebels in the governing parties took advantage of the secret ballot to vent their frustrations with the chancellor.   As bad as it was for Mrs. Merkel, it could have been much worse. Ahead of the vote, analysts said that an upset victory by the main opposition candidate, Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident and Protestant pastor, would deal such a severe blow to Mrs. Merkel's leadership that it might set in motion a crisis that would end her reign as chancellor, either through new elections or through a coup within her Christian Democratic party.   Mrs. Merkel's inability to take advantage of a clear majority in the special assembly reinforced the widespread impression in political circles and the German news media that she was losing her grip on her increasingly fractious coalition less than a year after winning a second term.   In the third round of voting, Mr. Wulff won 625 out of 1,244 votes by representatives to the assembly that chooses the president, a largely ceremonial figure. Mrs. Merkel's bloc brought 644 votes to the assembly, but the 625 votes for Mr. Wulff were still enough to make him the 10th president in Germany's post-World War II federal republic.   In a restrained victory speech that was so quiet it was at times hard to hear, Mr. Wulff said he had great respect for those who did not vote for him. ""I am convinced that with you, too, there will be fruitful cooperation,"" he said.   Asked by a reporter what had happened to the missing votes from her coalition, Mrs. Merkel answered, ""What counts is that we have a new president.""   Just how severe the damage was to Mrs. Merkel's fortunes was not immediately clear. In an editorial, the newspaper General-Anzeiger called the election ""the last warning"" for the government ""to finally bring the quarrels and skirmishes of recent months to an end.""    ""Anyone who thinks that this was a good day for the government is wrong,"" said Wolfgang Bosbach, a leading Christian Democrat in Parliament. ""When it comes down to it, you have to stand together. Politics is a team sport.""   The governing parties have suffered in the opinion polls over the course of a difficult year, which included Germany's participation in the unpopular bailout of the Greek government and a significant defeat in May in a local election in Germany's most populous state.   The presidential vote was necessary because President Horst Kohler abruptly resigned in May, after public criticism of comments he made about the German military's protecting the country's economic interests. Several other prominent members of Mrs. Merkel's party have also stepped down recently.   The election attracted unusual attention. Mr. Wulff looked nervous entering the Reichstag building  on Wednesday morning, despite a 21-vote cushion for Mrs. Merkel's conservatives and their neo-liberal allies, the Free Democrats.    Any concerns he might have had proved justified after he won just 600 votes in the first round of voting in the special assembly, 44 fewer than the governing coalition had at its disposal and short of the 623 votes needed to win.   A collective gasp went up in the Reichstag when Mr. Wulff's first-round vote total was announced and it became clear that there had been far more defections by conservative voters to Mr. Gauck than  political experts had predicted. The defections sent a clear signal of dissatisfaction with Mrs. Merkel's coalition, which in less than a year in power has earned a reputation more for infighting than for passing legislation.   ""Today's events document the fact that the chancellor no longer has things in hand,"" said Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the opposition Social Democrats, who was Mrs. Merkel's rival in the race for chancellor last year. ""The federal government has had to bow to the brutal reality that their promises of tax cuts in such a difficult economic situation were an illusion.""    Though Mr. Gauck's chances for an upset victory were never good, he was widely lauded in the German news media as the more inspiring choice, with his history of resistance to the Communist regime and his oratorical gifts. But his candidacy was also strategically canny for the opposition.   Mr. Gauck is popular in conservative circles, and he offered a tempting alternative to Mr. Wulff, a leading member of the Christian Democratic Union since his school days who most recently was state premier in Lower Saxony.   The election quickly evolved into a test for the government rather than a choice between the candidates. Leaders of the governing parties lobbied hard in recent weeks to keep their representatives in line behind Mr. Wulff, with only limited success.   The final-round victory prevented a complete debacle for Mrs. Merkel, but still had to sting. ""Anyone who knows politics in Germany knows that the damage will remain,"" said Kurt Beck, the Social Democratic state premier in Rhineland-Palatinate.   Public sentiment may have deterred any more of the assembly voters from defecting, particularly among Mrs. Merkel's partners, the Free Democrats. A recent survey of 2,500 Germans by Forsa, the independent polling institute, found that support for the Free Democrats had fallen to just 4 percent, compared with the nearly 15 percent of the vote the party won in last September's parliamentary election.   That reinforced what the regular opinion surveys all consistently show: Mrs. Merkel's coalition would be hard-pressed to win re-election if a new parliamentary vote were necessary.      ",2010-07-01
3677,2302935834.xml,"BERLIN -- A heavily armed gunman with a live-streaming head camera tried to storm a synagogue in eastern Germany on Wednesday as congregants observed the holiest day in Judaism. Foiled by a locked door, he killed two people outside and wounded two others in an anti-Semitic spree that smacked of far-right terrorism.Hours later the police announced the arrest of a suspect in the assault in the city of Halle, one of the most brazen in a string of recent attacks aimed at Jews in Germany. Police officials declined to confirm if the suspect was the gunman or whether he had any accomplices.The methodology of the assailant bore a striking resemblance to the rampage by a far-right extremist against two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, more than six months ago, in which he broadcast his killings live on social media. Fifty-one people died in that attack.Like the Christchurch killer, the Halle assailant recorded himself, in a 35-minute video of shooting, mayhem and hateful language. In accented English, he identified himself as Anon, denied the Holocaust, denounced feminists and immigrants, then declared: ""The root of all these problems is the Jew.""He then drove to Halle's Humboldt Street synagogue, showing the arsenal of weapons in his car. While trying unsuccessfully to enter the synagogue, which was locked, he fired at a woman passing by who had spoken to him, hitting her in the back. She crumpled and he shot her several more times, the video showed.After other failed attempts to enter the synagogue, including shooting at the door, he drove to a kebab shop and started shooting. Two men cowered behind a beverage machine, and he fired at them, the footage showed. He then shot at a pedestrian, drove his car closer to the kebab shop, shot at some other pedestrians, re-entered and shot the body of one victim several times. He returned to his car, shot over the roof, and drove off.""Watching the video was beyond disturbing, but extremely characteristic of this new wave of far-right terror,"" said Rita Katz, head of the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks hate groups online.The Halle attack was a ""reminder how connected a far-right attack in Germany is to one in New Zealand, Pittsburgh, California or elsewhere,"" Ms. Katz said. ""They aren't isolated events. They're continuations of each other.""A total of 51 congregants, including 10 young American visitors, were in the Halle synagogue during the assault, committed on Yom Kippur, the most solemn religious day for Jews. Officials said none were believed hurt.""Based on the information that we have at this point, we must assume that at the least, this was an anti-Semitic attack,"" said Horst Seehofer, Germany's interior minister.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany expressed her condolences to the families of the victims and her solidarity with Jews around the world. She also took part in a vigil outside Berlin's New Synagogue.The assailant uploaded his video to Twitch, a live-streaming platform owned by Amazon that has struggled with moderating the real-time content that floods in from millions of active broadcasters. Alerted to the broadcast, Twitch scrambled to remove it and issue an apology, but not before right-wing sites had archived it. Some exalted the killer as a hero.Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University who studies online extremism, wrote in a post on Twitter that footage of the attack flowed through the messaging platform Telegram within 30 minutes of the shootings, reaching more than 15,000 accounts.""We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany today, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected,"" Twitch said in a statement. ""Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously.""Amazon is a signatory of Christchurch Call, a pledge from online service providers including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to prevent users from uploading violent content involving terrorists and extremists.The police said earlier that at least two and possibly three gunmen had opened fire near the synagogue, but Mr. Seehofer spoke only of one.Parts of Halle, the birthplace of Handel, were locked down by the police for hours in a search for an assailant or assailants. By late evening restrictions in the city were lifted, the train station reopened and traffic returned to normal.""Our city was shaken by a terrible attack today,"" said Bernd Wiegand, the mayor of Halle. ""Two people lost their lives and two others are being treated in the hospital for their injuries.""Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, deplored the assault on Twitter, saying, ""We all must act against anti-Semitism in our country.""Recent weeks have been punctuated by a number of small attacks on Jews in Germany, where anti-Semitism is an especially sensitive legacy of the Nazi era. This year, Mr. Seehofer condemned a jump in anti-Semitic attacks, ranging from vandalism to targeting individuals wearing visible emblems of their faith. After Wednesday's shooting, police reinforcements were sent to synagogues across the country.Germany's federal prosecutor took over the investigation ""on suspicion of murder under special circumstance,"" said Dirk Hackler, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, but he declined to elaborate.The last time the federal prosecutor made such a move was after the killing of Walter Lübcke, a pro-refugee district representative and member of Ms. Merkel's conservative party who was slain in June.A witness to the shooting in Halle told the broadcaster MDR that he had seen a gunman dressed in military gear and armed with several weapons firing at the synagogue. Other news outlets reported that a hand grenade had been thrown into a Jewish cemetery nearby.Prayers for Yom Kippur began at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday and had been scheduled to continue until 8:30 p.m. It is the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar, and services brought many people to the temple.Max Privorozki, a leader of the Jewish community in Halle, told The Jewish Forum for Democracy that despite repeated requests for the police to provide security at the synagogue, there was no one outside when the attacker tried to force his way in. It took 10 minutes for the police to respond, he added, when he called for help.Police officials in Halle could not confirm whether there had been a security detail outside the synagogue, as is common in many of Germany's larger cities.""The attacker fired several times at the door and threw petrol bombs, firecrackers or other explosives to try to force his way in,"" Mr. Privorozki was quoted by Der Spiegel as saying. ""But the door stayed shut -- God protected us.""Immediately after the shooting, television footage showed police officers wearing helmets and carrying automatic weapons as they patrolled streets around the synagogue that had been sealed off with red-and-white tape. Other officers used a ladder to climb over a high brick wall surrounding the cemetery.Anti-Semitic crime and hate crimes targeting foreigners have both increased almost 20 percent in Germany over the past year, according to official figures published in May. The data included a wide range of offenses, including assault, insults, graffiti, hateful postings online and the use of Nazi symbols.Many Jewish institutions in Germany, including synagogues, schools and other cultural centers, are guarded by the local police. In Berlin, which has the country's largest Jewish population, the police have also provided security to cafes, restaurants and shops that are owned and frequented by Jews.Earlier this year, the country's top official for efforts against anti-Semitism warned that Jews should not wear their skullcaps everywhere in public.Halle, with a population of 230,000, is 100 miles southwest of Berlin and is the largest city in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. It boasts Gothic and Renaissance architecture, but today is a regional seat of trade and commerce.As news of Wednesday's shooting spread, condemnation and concern flowed in from across Europe. In Brussels, the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, expressed his condolences and called for a moment of silence for the victims. The Anti-Defamation League in New York called the attack ""heartbreaking"" and ""devastating,"" and thanked those in law enforcement for keeping ""our houses of worship and communal institutions safe and secure on this day and every day, in the U.S. and around the world.""The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement that he regarded the events in Halle as ""yet another tragic demonstration of anti-Semitism -- perpetrated on the holy day of Yom Kippur -- which needs to be fought with the utmost determination.""Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin, and Rick Gladstone and Tiffany Hsu from New York.

2955,1799779600.xml,"       PARIS -- IF there's one thing that chafes French pride, it's seeing the British steal the limelight. But in the face of real courage, even the proudest French person can only tip his hat and bow. The decision that the people of Britain have just made was indeed an act of courage -- the courage of a people who embrace their freedom. Brexit won out, defeating all forecasts. Britain decided to cast off from the European Union and reclaim its independence among the world's nations. It had been said that the election would hinge solely on economic matters; the British, however, were more insightful in understanding the real issue than commentators like to admit. British voters understood that behind prognostications about the pound's exchange rate and behind the debates of financial experts, only one question, at once simple and fundamental, was being asked: Do we want an undemocratic authority ruling our lives, or would we rather regain control over our destiny? Brexit is, above all, a political issue. It's about the free choice of a people deciding to govern itself. Even when it is touted by all the propaganda in the world, a cage remains a cage, and a cage is unbearable to a human being in love with freedom. The European Union has become a prison of peoples. Each of the 28 countries that constitute it has slowly lost its democratic prerogatives to commissions and councils with no popular mandate. Every nation in the union has had to apply laws it did not want for itself. Member nations no longer determine their own budgets. They are called upon to open their borders against their will. Countries in the eurozone face an even less enviable situation. In the name of ideology, different economies are forced to adopt the same currency, even if doing so bleeds them dry. It's a modern version of the Procrustean bed, and the people no longer have a say. And what about the European Parliament? It's democratic in appearance only, because it's based on a lie: the pretense that there is a homogeneous European people, and that a Polish member of the European Parliament has the legitimacy to make law for the Spanish. We have tried to deny the existence of sovereign nations. It's only natural that they would not allow being denied. Brexit wasn't the European people's first cry of revolt. In 2005, France and the Netherlands held referendums about the proposed European Union constitution. In both countries, opposition was massive, and other governments decided on the spot to halt the experiment for fear the contagion might spread. A few years later, the European Union constitution was forced on the people of Europe anyway, under the guise of the Lisbon Treaty. In 2008, Ireland, also by way of referendum, refused to apply that treaty. And once again, a popular decision was brushed aside. When in 2015 Greece decided by referendum to reject Brussels' austerity plans, the European Union's antidemocratic response took no one by surprise: To deny the people's will had become a habit. In a flash of honesty, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, unabashedly declared, ""There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties."" Brexit may not have been the first cry of hope, but it may be the people's first real victory. The British have presented the union with a dilemma it will have a hard time getting out of. Either it allows Britain to sail away quietly and thus runs the risk of setting a precedent: The political and economic success of a country that left the European Union would be clear evidence of the union's noxiousness. Or, like a sore loser, the union makes the British pay for their departure by every means possible and thus exposes the tyrannical nature of its power. Common sense points toward the former option. I have a feeling Brussels will choose the latter. One thing is certain: Britain's departure from the European Union will not make the union more democratic. The hierarchical structure of its supranational institutions will want to reinforce itself: Like all dying ideologies, the union knows only how to forge blindly ahead. The roles are already cast -- Germany will lead the way, and France will obligingly tag along. Here is a sign: President François Hollande of France, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain take their lead directly from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, without running through Brussels. A quip attributed to Henry Kissinger, ""Who do I call if I want to call Europe?"" now has a clear answer: Call Berlin. So the people of Europe have but one alternative left: to remain bound hand-and-foot to a union that betrays national interests and popular sovereignty and that throws our countries wide open to massive immigration and arrogant finance, or to reclaim their freedom by voting. Calls for referendums are ringing throughout the Continent. I myself have suggested to Mr. Hollande that one such public consultation be held in France. He did not fail to turn me down. More and more, the destiny of the European Union resembles the destiny of the Soviet Union, which died from its own contradictions. The People's Spring is now inevitable! The only question left to ask is whether Europe is ready to rid itself of its illusions, or if the return to reason will come with suffering. I made my decision a long time ago: I chose France. I chose sovereign nations. I chose freedom. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

3872,1511779189.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  NATO's foreign ministers vowed on Tuesday to strengthen the alliance's military presence on the territory of its Eastern European members because of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. The move came as the alliance ordered an end to ""all practical and military cooperation"" with Russia because of the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea and its threatening military posture near eastern Ukraine. ""Through its actions, Russia has chosen to undermine the very foundations upon which our cooperation is built,"" NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said at a news conference here. ""In light of this there can be no business as usual."" NATO's move codifies and expands on steps it had already taken to protest Russia's intervention in Crimea. Mr. Rasmussen said during a recent visit to Washington, for example, that the alliance had suspended plans to escort Russian ships that are ferrying chemicals for making poison gas out of Syria and had canceled staff-level meetings between NATO and Russian officials. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Rasmussen emphasized that the alliance would keep the door open for diplomatic discussions that might lead to an easing of the crisis and would continue to work with Russia on counternarcotics and other projects in Afghanistan. Regarding NATO's efforts to reassure its Eastern European members, a major agenda item here, Secretary of State John Kerry and foreign ministers from other countries directed the alliance's military command to develop a package of measures involving its air, sea and land forces.  So far, however, the steps the alliance envisions are modest. They are expected to include expanding the air patrols that NATO nations conduct over Baltic nations. The air patrols are being carried out from a base in Lithuania, and Estonia has offered to provide a second base to sustain expanded operations.  Another step would increase NATO's naval presence in the Baltic Sea. NATO is also expected to improve the capability of its response force -- which has air, land and sea units -- to quickly deploy in a crisis, diplomats said. Elements of that response force, for example, could be rotated through Baltic nations and other Eastern European members as part of an exercise. The alliance has not, however, committed to the continuous deployment of ground forces on the territory of Eastern European members, a form of assurance Eastern European officials would welcome.  ""What the Baltic States want is an allied presence in the form of boots on the ground,"" Lauri Lepik, Estonia's ambassador to NATO, said in an interview.  After meeting with his German and French counterparts in Weimar, Germany, on Tuesday, Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, told reporters his country wanted the alliance to deploy two combat brigades with as many as 5,000 troops each in Poland. Allied diplomats said that Mr. Sikorski did not propose such an sizable deployment in the closed-door meetings on Tuesday. Still, Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, indicated that the steps the alliance had taken so far fell short of what some Eastern European diplomats said they had wanted to demonstrate the alliance's commitment to their security. ""We are gaining something step by step, but the pace of NATO increasing its military presence for sure could be faster,"" Mr. Tusk said in a news conference in Warsaw, adding that the result was unsatisfactory. The meeting of NATO foreign ministers was being held at a time of intense concern about the deployment of 35,000 to 50,000 Russian troops near Ukraine, according to American estimates. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Monday that some Russian forces from the border area near Ukraine were being pulled back, the chancellor's office said.  But Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's top military commander, told diplomats in a closed-door session on Tuesday that the alliance's intelligence reports did not confirm that Russia was withdrawing a significant number of troops. Mr. Rasmussen repeated that point publicly.  ""This massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation,"" Mr. Rasmussen said. ""So I continue to urge Russia to pull back its troops, live up to its international obligation and engage in a constructive dialogue with Ukraine."" NATO's efforts to help Ukraine's beleaguered military are also modest. A statement issued by the NATO-Ukraine Commission said the alliance would add experts to its liaison office in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, and encourage defense overhauls in Ukraine. Yet some experts have urged the alliance to do much more to help Ukraine's forces. Western officials said in recent weeks that Ukraine was seeking communications gear, mine-clearing equipment, vehicles, ammunition, fuel and medical gear, and possibly the sharing of intelligence, though this could be problematic because of the presence of Russian agents in the country.  Andriy Deshchytsia, Ukraine's acting foreign minister, said that a team of the alliance's experts would be visiting the country to assess what assistance the Ukrainian military needed. He said that Ukraine was not looking for weapons but had many other deficiencies that he hoped the alliance could help remedy. Credit: MICHAEL R.

1591,1677298882.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is fending off allegations that the German secret service helped the United States to spy on European partners and companies, nearly a year after Ms. Merkel expelled the top American spy in a rare display of anger over revelations of widespread United States intelligence operations in Germany. Over the past week, the German news media has reported that the country's foreign intelligence agency, known by its German initials, B.N.D., gathered information on European companies at the behest of the United States National Security Agency for years, citing confidential documents and government experts. The aviation giant Airbus said Thursday that it had filed a legal complaint against unknown persons over acts of criminal espionage and was seeking information from the German government in the wake of the reports. On Monday, the newspaper Bild named the aviation company as a target of the American agency. ""We are aware that as a major player in this industry we are a target for intelligence activities. In this particular case there appears to be a reasonable suspicion of alleged industrial espionage,"" Airbus said in an emailed statement. ""We are alarmed by this."" Germans hold privacy in high regard, given their history of police states under the Nazis and, in the old East Germany, the Communist Party. In 2013, the country displayed a collective outrage over revelations that American intelligence agencies had been monitoring Ms. Merkel's cellphone conversations and German telecommunications. The German news media have further said that the Merkel government knew of cooperation between the B.N.D. and the American spy services, but withheld that information from a parliamentary committee assigned to investigate the affair. The chancellor says her office, which oversees B.N.D. operations, has cooperated fully with the lawmakers' inquiry, but one of her strongest allies, Thomas de Maizière, who was Ms. Merkel's chief of staff from 2005 to 2009, is facing allegations that he lied to Parliament about cooperation with American intelligence agencies. ""I strongly reject allegations the government did not tell the truth,"" Steffen Seibert, Ms. Merkel's spokesman said Wednesday. Mr. Maizière, now the interior minister, has consistently denied misleading Parliament. In the latest round of revelations, the daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Thursday that B.N.D. helped the United States spy on high-ranking members of France's Foreign Ministry and presidency, as well as on the European Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the commission, said in Brussels that investigating the allegations was a matter for the German Parliament. ""The German authorities will have to deal with that and I suppose that they will do so,"" Mr. Juncker said. Mr. Juncker came under scrutiny last year over allegations in the news media that more than 300 companies benefited from preferential tax deals with Luxembourg during the nearly two decades he was that country's prime minister. ""I know from personal experience that they are very difficult to be kept under control,"" Mr. Juncker said, wryly adding that amid all the rumors of spies in Brussels, ""the commission should have a secret service."" Correction:  May 6, 2015, Wednesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about allegations that the German intelligence agency known as B.N.D. helped the United States National Security Agency spy on European partners and companies referred incorrectly to the B.N.D.

2543,434075429.xml,"      It was called ""the shot that changed the republic.""    The killing in 1967 of an unarmed demonstrator by a police officer in West Berlin set off a left-wing protest movement and put conservative West Germany on course to evolve into the progressive country it has become today.   Now a discovery in the archives of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi, has upended Germany's perception of its postwar history. The killer, Karl-Heinz Kurras, though working for the West Berlin police, was at the time also acting as a Stasi spy for East Germany.   It is as if the shooting deaths of four students at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard had been committed by an undercover K.G.B. officer, though the reverberations in Germany seemed to have run deeper.    ""It makes a hell of a difference whether John F. Kennedy was killed by just a loose cannon running around or a Secret Service agent working for the East,"" said Stefan Aust, the former editor in chief of the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel. ""I would never, never, ever have thought that this could be true.""    The revelation last week that researchers, looking into Berlin Wall deaths and East German intelligence, had stumbled across Mr. Kurras's Stasi files raised a host of uncomfortable issues that are suddenly the subject of national debate.    For the left, Mr. Kurras's true allegiance strikes at the underpinnings of the 1968 protest movement in Germany. The killing provided the clear-cut rationale for the movement's opposition to what its members saw as a violent, unjust state, when in fact the supposed fascist villain of leftist lore was himself a committed socialist.   There is the sobering reminder of the Stasi infiltration of West German structures, but also the question of whether it went much deeper than has ever been uncovered. The Stasi's reach in East Germany is well known; Chancellor Angela Merkel said just last week that the security service had tried to recruit her, though she had turned it down.   The most insidious question raised by the revelation is whether Mr. Kurras might have been acting not only as a spy, but also as an agent provocateur, trying to destabilize West Germany. As the newspaper Bild am Sonntag put it in a headline, referring to the powerful former leader of the dreaded East German security agency, Erich Mielke, ""Did Mielke Give Him the Order to Shoot?""   The historians who unearthed the 17 volumes of files that revealed Mr. Kurras's double life say there is no evidence to support the theory that the Stasi was behind the killing. Berlin officials have resisted public calls from victims' groups and others to retry Mr. Kurras. He was acquitted in 1967, the year of the shooting, of manslaughter charges and was later allowed to rejoin the police force after the verdict was upheld.   In an interview with the Bild, Mr. Kurras, 81, confirmed that he had been in the East German Communist Party. ""Should I be ashamed of that or something?"" Mr. Kurras was quoted as saying. As for the Stasi, he said, ""And what if I did work for them? What does it matter? It doesn't change anything,"" the paper reported.   Mr. Kurras does not deny that he shot the demonstrator, Benno Ohnesorg, in the back of the head, but has said the shooting was an accident. He denied records showing he had been paid by the security service, and said the agents who had put those details in his file must have been lining their own pockets.   Mr. Kurras was born in East Prussia and volunteered for military service in 1944 when he was 16 years old. He was imprisoned not long after the war by the Soviets at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for three years. He was known to be an enthusiastic gun collector and an excellent marksman.   He began leading a secret double life in 1955, when he went to the authorities in East Berlin and asked to move to East Germany and join the police there. Instead, according to files unearthed by the historians Helmut Muller-Enbergs and Cornelia Jabs, he was told to stay with the police in West Berlin while spying for the Stasi, and he had a cover name, Otto Bohl.   If Mr. Kurras seemed to fit the bill of the ""fascist cop,"" Mr. Ohnesorg came across as the most innocent of victims. A student who also wrote poetry, he was married, his wife pregnant with their first child, when he went to a demonstration against a state visit by Iran's leader, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.    Mr. Ohnesorg's death had a powerful mobilizing effect. The photograph of a woman cradling his head as he lay on the ground is among the most iconic images in Germany. Average students who might never have joined the 1968 protest movement were moved to action. And on a darker note it became the chief justification for violent action by terrorist groups like the Red Army Faction and the Second of June Movement, which even took its name from the day of Mr. Ohnesorg's killing.   ""The biggest milestone on the road toward violence was not what people thought it was,"" said Mr. Aust, who also wrote a book on the Red Army Faction. ""The pure fact that he was an agent from the East changes a lot, whether he acted on orders or not.""   While the East German government highlighted the killing for propaganda purposes, the dissension and upheaval sowed by the shooting were  temporary and had the unintended consequence of making the West a far more attractive alternative to the East in the long run.   According to Marek Dutschke, the son of the student-movement leader Rudi Dutschke, Mr. Ohnesorg's death ignited the modernization of West Germany, leading to greater democracy, gender equality and sexual freedom.    ""Germany would not have become this liberal place, not in the same way, if this event hadn't happened,"" Mr. Dutschke said.

4189,433962936.xml,"      It is not clear how much the leaders of 18 countries plus the European Union, gathering to discuss a fast-moving financial crisis with a soon-to-depart leader of the United States, can hope to accomplish.   But this weekend's summit meeting by the Group of 20  may clarify one thing: how completely the crisis is reshaping the economic map  --  rendering obsolete the old club of Western powers that fashioned the financial pillars of the post-World War II era at a conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944.   While President Nicolas Sarkozy of France proposed this meeting, and President Bush agreed to play host, the most sought-after country at a gathering some have called Bretton Woods II may prove to be China.   With close to $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and an economy that is still growing, albeit more slowly than before the crisis erupted, China is one of the few participants with the financial wherewithal to come to the aid of countries in distress, either directly or by swelling the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, so that it can make more emergency loans.   The same is true of Saudi Arabia, the sole Persian Gulf oil producer to attend the meeting. Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain has already solicited the wealthy Arab kingdom for money to bolster the I.M.F.   ""The G-7  was basically the leading 20th-century industrial countries,"" Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said. ""But we need something more than a few key players at these meetings. You have to engage other participants.""   Some of these other participants  --  ranging from Argentina to Australia  --  have been hit hard by the crisis that began in the United States and spread to Europe. Many have suffered a cash squeeze as Western investors have pulled capital out of emerging markets to cover losses at home.   For some countries, like South Korea, it is a nasty replay of the Asian financial crisis a decade ago  --  except that this time, their governments have pursued generally responsible economic policies and open financial markets.   What demands these countries make in Washington is one of the big unanswered questions of the meeting.    The decision to broaden the invitation list was made by Mr. Bush  --  in recognition, his advisers said, that the financial crisis had become a global affliction that demanded global responses.   Still, with the United States the epicenter and, to many of the attendees, the cause of the crisis, the shift in the power balance has been accentuated all the more.   President-elect Barack Obama will be  conspicuous in  his absence. He is  dispatching some emissaries to meet with foreign leaders, but taking no position on proposed new regulations for the international financial markets.   The Bush administration is playing down the prospects for major results from the meeting, partly because it opposes efforts by some Europeans to create a latticework of new regulations and partly because it does not want to commit Mr. Obama to measures that he may not support. Mr. Bush, some observers predicted, could end up a bystander at his own gathering.    Given the divergent agendas of the other participants  --  and the ambitions of some of its leaders, notably Mr. Sarkozy, to stride across the global stage  --  this has raised some intriguing possibilities.   ""Are the Europeans or the Chinese going to take advantage of this interregnum in the U.S. to set the tone for the future of financial regulation?"" said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist of the I.M.F.   The Europeans have a long list of measures they favor to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, including  executive pay limits and robust oversight of banks, hedge funds and credit-rating agencies.    They also want to coordinate financial regulation among countries, perhaps through colleges of supervisors or a global regulatory council, which could be housed at the I.M.F.     ""We know it's an awkward time for the United States, but we feel these issues are too important to wait,"" said the British ambassador to the United States, Nigel Sheinwald, in a briefing Wednesday.   The Bush administration said it would resist any efforts  to create regulatory agencies with cross-border authority, something the French have discussed. It opposes regulating hedge funds, something the Germans are keen to pursue. And it is not enthusiastic about bolstering the resources of the I.M.F., as the British have advocated.   For all their calls to action, the Europeans are not united. The French favor tighter global coordination of regulation than do the British. The Germans are skeptical of financial arrangements that could force them to bail out their neighbors.   The European Commission has just begun a six-month study on how to harmonize regulations in Europe, which, for now, could limit the options of Mr. Sarkozy, Mr. Brown, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. ""I'm a little skeptical that they'll do more than float some trial balloons on this,"" said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which represents more than 300 global banks.   In briefings, British, French and German diplomats said they hoped to extract real results, which could be turned into an ""action plan"" and set the agenda for a follow-up meeting in 100 days or so. But China's position on regulations is a mystery, even to those who follow it closely, and other emerging economies have yet to stake out their positions.    As a result, the communique issued at the end of the meeting is unlikely to include more than general commitments to sound regulations and closer coordination among countries, officials said.   As the ambitions for the meeting have narrowed, the talk of a latter-day Bretton Woods has come to seem fanciful. The participants agree that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  --  products of the original Bretton Woods --  should continue to serve as central institutions.   Europeans want the I.M.F. to have larger resources for emergency aid. But it is not clear how to do that without giving cash-rich countries like China and the oil exporters a bigger voice in its governance.   With so little agreement on regulations, some experts say, the meeting would be best used as an occasion to pledge a coordinated effort to stimulate the flagging global economy. Here again, China has taken the lead  --  announcing a $586 billion stimulus package last weekend.   ""It certainly puts Hu Jintao into an extremely strong position, coming into the meeting,"" said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to China's president, who is traveling with a 100-person delegation.   Germany just announced a modest stimulus plan and Britain plans one next week, leaving Mr. Bush, who opposes further economic stimulus, as the odd man out. Then again, Mr. Obama favors such a package, and the Democratic Congress has promised to take it up in a special session next week, or in January after Mr. Obama takes office.    ""It feels like we're waiting for the new king to arrive,"" Mr. Johnson of M.I.T. said. ""It could be a moment of resurgent American power, especially if nothing gets done this weekend.""

370,1774288402.xml,"       BERLIN -- Guido Westerwelle, who served as Germany's first openly gay foreign minister and kept his country out of NATO's intervention in Libya, died on Friday in Cologne. He was 54. His foundation and the German government announced his death. The cause was complications of leukemia, which was diagnosed in 2014. Mr. Westerwelle was a former leader of the Free Democratic Party, which governed in a coalition with the Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Angela Merkel until the party suffered a crushing defeat in the 2013 elections. He was the highest-ranking openly gay person in the German government, having risen to the position of vice chancellor. As foreign minister from 2009 to 2013, he had the uncomfortable task of visiting countries where homosexuality is not accepted, or even legal. ""We have lost a man who has dominated our country for a generation -- as party leader of the F.D.P., as opposition leader and then as foreign minister,"" Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who preceded and succeeded Mr. Westerwelle as foreign minister, said in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry in a statement called Mr. Westerwelle a ""champion of democracy and human rights"" and lauded him for ""speaking out on extrajudicial detentions, visiting Syrian refugees in the Zaatari refugee camp, and meeting with Ukrainian protesters"" in Kiev. For most of Germany's postwar history, the Free Democrats -- a liberal party that stood for lower taxes and more efficient government -- were the kingmakers in the country's politics, entering partnerships with either the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats to form stable governments. The Free Democrats made surprising gains in the 2009 federal elections and joined the Christian Democrats after Ms. Merkel's first four years in power as part of a ""grand coalition"" with the center left. In 2012, during the eurozone crisis, Mr. Westerwelle and Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland at the time, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times calling for overhauls to strengthen the European Union. ""For Europe to be a truly strong actor and global leader, it needs a strong institutional setup, a streamlined and efficient system for the separation of powers,"" they wrote. ""It also needs a directly elected European Commission president who personally appoints the members of his 'European Government,' a European Parliament with the powers to initiate legislation and a second chamber for member states."" Mr. Westerwelle was born in Bad Honnef, near the West German capital, Bonn, on Dec. 27, 1961. He joined the Free Democratic Party in 1980 and led the party's youth organization as a law student at the University of Bonn. Mr. Westerwelle became general secretary of his party in December 1994, days before his 33rd birthday, and entered Parliament in 1996. He was elected party chairman in 2001 and held that office until 2011. In 2002, he began what he called a ""Fun Campaign,"" canvassing Germany in a bright yellow bus called the Guidomobile. His party fell far short of its goal of 18 percent of the vote -- it earned less than half that -- but he went on to serve a prominent role in the opposition, earning respect for his sharp, witty style of debate. His vindication came in 2009, when he led the Free Democrats to their best result ever in parliamentary elections, ending an 11-year-old spell in opposition. It was the high point of his career. It is traditional for the second party in a German coalition to get control of the foreign ministry, and so Mr. Westerwelle, as leader of the Free Democrats, took charge. He occasionally found that his skills as an opposition politician were not the same as those needed for the nation's top diplomat. (He was derided by some reporters when, at his first official news conference, he declined to take a question in English.) But over time Mr. Westerwelle grew into the role, earning respect as he held to Germany's postwar tradition of cultural openness combined with military restraint. This contributed to Germany's opposition to NATO's intervention in Libya. There was little appetite -- either in Ms. Merkel's government or among the public -- for Germany to play a part. But Mr. Westerwelle and others who opposed the action in Libya still found themselves targets of foreign criticism, even when the turmoil in Libya bolstered critics of the original intervention. Mr. Westerwelle always said his great model was Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a veteran Free Democrat foreign minister who helped oversee Germany's reunification in 1990. In November, Mr. Westerwelle made a characteristically determined attempt to return to public life, giving a series of television interviews and publishing a book, ""Between Two Lives: Of Love, Death and Confidence."" Shortly afterward, however, he entered the University Clinic in Cologne. He did not leave. Mr. Westerwelle is survived by his husband, Michael Mronz. ""We are thankful for an unbelievably great time together,"" the two men wrote in a statement that the Westerwelle Foundation for International Understanding released on Friday. ""The love remains.""

3696,1103143805.xml,"       PARIS -- By naming the European Union the recipient of the 2012 peace prize on Friday, the Norwegian Nobel Committee made an unconventional choice that celebrated the bloc's postwar integration even as a financial crisis and political infighting threaten to tear it apart. Members of the Nobel committee lauded six decades of reconciliation among enemies who fought Europe's bloodiest wars while simultaneously warning against the hazards of the present. The decision sounded at times like a plea to support the endangered institution at a difficult hour. ""We see already now an increase of extremism and nationalistic attitudes,"" said Thorbjorn Jagland, the former Norwegian prime minister who is chairman of the panel awarding the prize, in an interview after announcing the award. ""There is a real danger that Europe will start disintegrating. Therefore, we should focus again on the fundamental aims of the organization."" Yet on the very day that the award was announced in Oslo, leading European policy makers again publicly bickered over how to deal with Greece's bailout. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, rejected calls from the French head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, to give Greece more time to make additional spending cuts to rein in deficits.  The intractable debt troubles in Greece have been at the heart of the financial crisis that has gone on for years and has taken a tremendous toll on Europe's economy, breeding ill will between the suffering periphery and officials in Germany, who have called for painful austerity as the price of continued German support for the rising debt.  ""The leader of the E.U. is Germany, which is in an economic war with southern Europe,"" said Stavros Polychronopoulos, 60, a retired lawyer in Athens. ""I consider this war equal to a real war. They don't help peace.""  Mr. Polychronopoulos stood Friday in the central Syntagma Square in Athens, where residue from tear gas fired by the police during demonstrations on Tuesday to protest a visit by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, still clung to the sidewalks.  In light of the recent upheaval, the Nobel announcement was greeted with surprise, perplexity and, from some corners, even mockery. ""The Nobel committee is a little late for an April Fool's joke,"" said Martin Callanan, a British member of the European Parliament and the leader of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. ""The E.U.'s policies have exacerbated the fallout of the financial crisis and led to social unrest that we haven't seen for a generation.""  Before making its choice, the Norwegian panel -- located, as it happens, in an oil-rich kingdom whose population of five million people has steadfastly resisted membership of the 27-nation European Union -- weighed 231 nominations. One committee member, a Socialist critical of the union, had a stroke recently and was replaced by a more Europe-friendly moderate, ensuring the committee's tradition of unanimous decisions.  The peace prize is associated with diplomats or heads of state who have ended wars, or individuals like Mother Teresa and Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu fighting poverty or injustice. Last year's peace prize was shared by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia; a Liberian antiwar activist, Leymah Gbowee; and Tawakkol Karman, a democracy activist in Yemen. The 2010 peace prize winner was Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese human rights campaigner. But as it has in the past, notably in bestowing the 2009 peace prize on President Obama less than one year after he took office, the selection by the highly politicized committee sometimes reflects hope as much as achievement, seeking to bolster good intentions with a prestigious accolade that provides an unparalleled, if often contentious, global imprimatur. Ms. Merkel called the award ""an inducement and an obligation at the same time."" The announcement was taken by the European Union elite in Brussels -- and by its surviving founders -- as a moment of profound vindication. José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the award proved that the European body was ""something very precious."" ""It is justified recognition for a unique project that works for the benefit of its citizens and also for the benefit of the world,"" he said. ""The award today by the Nobel committee shows that even in these difficult times, the European Union remains an inspiration for countries and people all over the world and that the international community needs a strong European Union."" For all the talk of unity, however, a variety of signals suggested the opposite. European officials immediately raised the question of who would accept the peace prize on behalf of the bloc's often bickering members, divided by tensions between its more affluent north and its struggling south. They are also frequently at odds over personality differences and critical questions, like whether Turkey should be admitted and whether the euro zone should include more countries than its current 17. At its headquarters in Brussels, several figureheads compete for prominence, including Mr. Barroso, the president of the European Commission, which enforces European treaties, and Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which represents heads of European Union governments. Additionally, the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, said in a statement that his institution expected to be part of the award ceremony. The rivalries recalled a remark ascribed to Henry A. Kissinger, the former United States secretary of state: ""Who do I call if I want to call Europe?"" The differences extend beyond the Continent's many languages to broader questions of commitment to the European integration project. Some Europeans asked whether the bloc's dismal track record in dealing with the Balkan wars of the 1990s and its performance in the current economic crisis justified a prize for spreading peace. At the news conference in Oslo to announce the award, Mr. Jagland said the committee had ""no ambitions"" that the $1.2 million prize would solve the multibillion-euro crisis. ""The stabilizing part played by the E.U. has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace,"" he said. ""The union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."" He added: ""The dreadful suffering in World War II demonstrated the need for a new Europe. Over a 70-year period, Germany and France had fought three wars. Today, war between Germany and France is unthinkable."" He also cited the admission of Greece, Spain and Portugal in the 1980s after they emerged from dictatorships, with democracy as a condition for membership, as well as the ending of the divisions between east and west after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as successes for the European Union.  ""The admission of Croatia as a member next year, the opening of membership negotiations with Montenegro, and the granting of candidate status to Serbia all strengthen the process of reconciliation in the Balkans,"" he said.  Maurice Faure, the last living French signatory to the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, a precursor to the modern union, called the prize ""the finest reward, the official recognition of what we developed, notably peace."" ""The European Union remains a work in progress,"" he said. Credit: ALAN COWELL and NICHOLAS KULISH; Alan Cowell reported from Paris, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

83,1755237103.xml,"       ON New Year's Eve, in the shadow of Cologne's cathedral, crowds of North African and Middle Eastern men accosted women out for the night's festivities. They surrounded them, groped them, robbed them. Two women were reportedly raped. Though there were similar incidents from Hamburg to Helsinki, the authorities at first played down the assaults, lest they prove inconvenient for Angela Merkel's policy of mass asylum for refugees. That delay has now cost Cologne's police chief his job. But the German government still seems more concerned about policing restless natives -- most recently through a deal with Facebook and Google to restrict anti-immigrant postings -- than with policing migration. Just last week Merkel rejected a proposal to cap refugee admissions (which topped one million last year) at 200,000 in 2016. The underlying controversy here is not a new one. For decades conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic have warned that Europe's generous immigration policies, often pursued in defiance of ordinary Europeans' wishes, threaten to destabilize the continent. The conservatives have made important points about the difficulty of assimilation, the threat of radicalization, and the likelihood of Paris-style and Cologne-style violence in European cities. But they have also trafficked in more apocalyptic predictions -- fears of a ""Eurabia,"" of mass Islamification -- that were somewhat harder to credit. Until recently, Europe's assimilation challenge looked unpleasant but not insurmountable, and the likelihood of Yugoslavian-style balkanization relatively remote. With the current migration, though, we're in uncharted territory. The issue isn't just that immigrants are arriving in the hundreds of thousands rather than the tens of thousands. It's that a huge proportion of them are teenage and twentysomething men. In Sweden, for instance, which like Germany has had an open door, 71 percent of all asylum applicants in 2015 were men. Among the mostly-late-teenage category of ""unaccompanied minors,"" as Valerie Hudson points out in an important essay for Politico,"" the ratios were even more skewed: ""11.3 boys for every one girl."" As Hudson notes, these trends have immediate implications for civil order -- young men are, well, young men; societies with skewed sex ratios tend to be unstable; and many of these men carry assumptions about women's roles that are diametrically opposed to the values of contemporary Europe. But there's also a longer term issue, beyond the need to persuade new arrivals that -- to quote from a Norwegian curriculum for migrants -- in Europe ""to force someone into sex is not permitted."" When immigration proceeds at a steady but modest clip, deep change comes slowly, and there's time for assimilation to do its work. That's why the Muslim population in Europe has been growing only at one percentage point a decade; it's why many of the Turkish and North African immigrants who arrived in Germany and France decades ago are reasonably Europeanized today. But if you add a million (or millions) of people, most of them young men, in one short period, you get a very different kind of shift. In the German case the important number here isn't the country's total population, currently 82 million. It's the twentysomething population, which was less than 10 million in 2013 (and of course already included many immigrants). In that cohort and every cohort afterward, the current influx could have a transformative effect. How transformative depends on whether these men eventually find a way to bring brides and families to Europe as well. In terms of immediate civil peace, family formation or unification offers promise, since men with wives and children are less likely to grope revelers or graffiti synagogues or seek the solidarity of radicalism. But it could also double or treble this migration's demographic impact, pushing Germany toward a possible future in which half the under-40 population would consist of Middle Eastern and North African immigrants and their children. If you believe that an aging, secularized, heretofore-mostly-homogeneous society is likely to peacefully absorb a migration of that size and scale of cultural difference, then you have a bright future as a spokesman for the current German government. You're also a fool. Such a transformation promises increasing polarization among natives and new arrivals alike. It threatens not just a spike in terrorism but a rebirth of 1930s-style political violence. The still-imaginary France Michel Houellebecq conjured up in his novel ""Submission,"" in which nativists and Islamists brawl in the streets, would have a very good chance of being realized in the German future. This need not happen. But prudence requires doing everything possible to prevent it. That means closing Germany's borders to new arrivals for the time being. It means beginning an orderly deportation process for able-bodied young men. It means giving up the fond illusion that Germany's past sins can be absolved with a reckless humanitarianism in the present. It means that Angela Merkel must go -- so that her country, and the continent it bestrides, can avoid paying too high a price for her high-minded folly.

1733,1011364528.xml,"      BERLIN -- In the volatile aftermath of raucous elections, which nearly destroyed the political establishment in Greece and ended 17 years of conservative reign in France, the emphasis across Europe, even in the austerity heartland of Germany, has shifted to the very real problem of growth for the stagnant Continent.    But there are few ready answers for how to turn around recessionary economies during a major sovereign debt crisis, and it will take weeks of contentious wrangling to determine whether the Germans can be pressed to make more than cosmetic changes to their focus on fiscal discipline for all.   At the ascetic end are modest concessions by Germany to repackage existing initiatives to be more supportive of growth. At the opposite extreme, particularly in countries plagued by soaring unemployment, are calls to unleash the European Central Bank to intervene more aggressively in bond markets and for governments to use the credit of the strongest European countries to support growth in the weaker ones through common ""euro bonds.""   Francois Hollande, who defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday's runoff election in France, has provided a rallying point for those across Europe who support stimulus spending to promote short-term growth as the way out of the crisis. But he will face a difficult path if he cannot budge Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany away from her insistence on austerity.   ""By himself, Hollande cannot change the world,"" said Peter Bofinger, a prominent economist on Ms. Merkel's independent council of economic experts. ""There are laws of economic gravity, and if he alone says, 'I'm willing to accept higher deficits,' the risk is high that the markets will force him to give in.""   Mr. Bofinger said that what was needed was to slow down spending cuts for countries in the midst of recession and ""a transfer of fiscal sovereignty to the euro-area level"" as a step toward euro bonds. But he said that such an approach was still extremely unpopular in Germany.   Ms. Merkel left no doubt about whether she was ready to embrace the most radical measures, strongly rejecting Mr. Hollande's suggestion that European leaders reopen a compact on deficit reduction that they adopted in March.   ""We in Germany are of the opinion, and so am I personally, that the fiscal pact is not negotiable,"" Ms. Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin. ""It has been negotiated and has been signed by 25 countries.""   Mr. Hollande's victory is a significant moment in Europe's continuing efforts to manage the crisis, ejecting Ms. Merkel's closest collaborator, Mr. Sarkozy, from office. But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Hollande's election is a real turning point or Ms. Merkel is able to stick to austerity while making only symbolic gestures toward flexibility on the margins.    ""Everyone's talking about some kind of space between structural reforms, like liberalizing labor markets, and the kind of direct stimulus Germans call crude Keynesian measures on the other hand,"" said Hans Kundnani, a Germany expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. ""I'm not sure what space there is between those two.""   German intransigence also reflects a shift in recent years toward greater self-assurance and a willingness to pursue the country's own interests more overtly than it had in the postwar era. ""Germans have become in a sense much more confident about saying, 'This is what we think, and we don't care if you agree with us,' "" said Mr. Kundnani. ""Economists who disagree with them are perceived as being anti-German.""    But discontent has soared in Europe, evident in the high number of voters supporting radical parties both in the first round of voting in the French presidential election and in Sunday's vote in Greece, which brought an extreme-right party, the ultranationalist Golden Dawn party, into Parliament in Athens for the first time.   In the meantime, the number of prominent politicians demanding new stimulus measures has grown. In Rome, Prime Minister Mario Monti, a technocrat appointed in November as the euro crisis deepened, said the outcome of the French vote was a ""call for a reflection on European policies.""    ""Responsible public finances are a necessary condition, but certainly not sufficient for the key objective: sustainable growth that creates employment and is orientated toward social equality,"" Mr. Monti said. ""For this reason it is fundamentally important that Europe urgently adopts concrete policies for growth.""    Ms. Merkel's political opponents at home also said a shift was necessary. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said on Monday that the result in France showed that ""the politics of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy led Europe deeper into crisis."" The victory for Mr. Hollande will ""not only change France, but finally help Europe to go in another direction,"" Mr. Gabriel said.    Yet the consensus for lower budget deficits and public debts is entrenched in Germany and reaches across party lines. Mr. Gabriel was careful to add that ""no one wants to do away with the fiscal pact,"" but merely add measures promoting growth and jobs to it.    Klaus-Peter Flosbach, a member of the finance committee in Parliament and a spokesman on finance matters for Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic delegation, said: ""The fiscal pact is the basis for further cooperation. In the parliamentary groups of the coalition there is absolutely no support for introducing euro bonds.""   The hard line embraced by Ms. Merkel and her party has been popular with German voters, and as the country's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, prepares to vote in a new state Parliament next week, it is little wonder that Ms. Merkel refuses to bend. Nor can Mr. Hollande afford to tone down his message with the French parliamentary elections coming up.    ""I don't see coordinated fiscal stimulus happening,"" said Mark Hallerberg, director of the Fiscal Governance Center at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Action by the European Central Bank, however, seems more likely.   ""Euro bonds are a red line; quantitative easing much less so,"" Mr. Hallerberg said. ""It's fashionable for the Bundesbank to always complain, but it's only one vote. Merkel can blame the bank. The Germans may be sending mixed signals.""   The adjustment will be slow and incremental rather than quick and decisive. ""There will be a bit of inflation, and there will be some pay increases,"" Mr. Hallerberg said. ""Higher wages make Germans wealthier. It's hard to hate.""   In an interview in the German newsweekly Focus, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said it was appropriate for wages to rise more quickly in Germany than in other European Union countries. ""These wage increases also have the effect of reducing the imbalances within Europe,"" Mr. Schauble said.    At the news conference on Monday, Ms. Merkel explained her rationale for holding the line on spending, describing how in her view the debt crisis grew out of the coordinated stimulus packages in the first phase of the financial crisis.    ""We are in the middle of a debate to which France, of course, under its new president, will bring its own emphasis,"" she said. ""But we are talking about two sides of the same coin: progress is only achievable via solid finances plus growth.""   Ms. Merkel said she telephoned Mr. Hollande on Sunday night to congratulate him on his victory and expected him to come to Berlin soon. ""I may say from my side that Francois Hollande will be welcomed with open arms here in Germany by me,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""We will work together well and intensively.""

4013,1505260502.xml,"       KEY LARGO, Fla. --  President Obama and his family disappeared behind the gates of a lush oceanfront resort here on Friday afternoon to begin a weekend getaway that was in doubt until the evening before because of the tumultuous events in Crimea and Ukraine. Deciding when a president should cancel or cut short a vacation is always a politically fraught exercise. This time, the White House's calculation was even more complicated because Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. left Friday for three days in the Virgin Islands. Further thinning the administration's national security ranks, John Kerry, the secretary of state, and the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, were traveling separately in the Middle East. The White House defended Mr. Obama's decision, saying he had kept a close eye on the Ukraine crisis all week, getting briefed and placing calls to the leaders of Russia, Germany, Britain and Japan, even as he rolled out his annual $3.9 trillion budget and traveled to New England. ""What the president will be doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the president would be doing back at the White House,"" the deputy press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Air Force One. ""It's just that the weather will be a little warmer.""  The first thing Mr. Obama did after landing in this sanctuary of flowering trees and Spanish-style villas was call Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. Key Largo, at the northern end of the Florida Keys, is a sumptuous haven for sport fishers and scuba divers, who prospect the coral reefs offshore. It was immortalized in the 1948 film of the same name, with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and somewhat less memorably in a 1981 pop ballad by Bertie Higgins. Inside their sanctuary, the Ocean Reef Club, the Obamas will lack for little. The pristine resort has two 18-hole golf courses, tennis courts, a spa and fitness center, a 175-slip marina and a private airport, where the president's helicopter, Marine One, landed next to seaplanes, a private jet, and a crowd of well-wishers, including one in a bikini, who arrived in a fleet of golf carts. Mr. Earnest allowed that, if push came to shove, the president might avail himself of some of the ""recreational amenities,"" though as with all presidential vacations, the White House made it sound as if leisure was absolutely the last thing on Mr. Obama's mind. ""What he will do, and what he is looking forward to doing, is getting a little downtime in the warm weather with his wife and daughters,"" Mr. Earnest said. Mr. Obama has taken good care of himself lately, including three days of golf with high-school friends from Honolulu last month at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Mr. Obama did have a working dinner with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the start of that weekend. Before going off the clock this time, Mr. Obama and the first lady squeezed in a visit to the Coral Reef High School in Miami, where the president announced a new program to encourage high school students to file applications for federal student aid to pay for college. ""My challenge today is to every high school student in America: Fill out the form,"" Mr. Obama told 1,650 boisterous students in a gym. ""We're making it easier than ever, we made it shorter,"" he said. ""It takes about half an hour to fill out, and it could change your life."" Stopping first in a classroom, the first couple quizzed a group of high school seniors about their future plans. One young man told Mr. Obama he was waiting to hear whether he had been admitted to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He also planned to start his own cellphone business. ""I want to buy stock in this guy,"" Mr. Obama said, drawing a sidelong glance from Mrs. Obama. ""You've got to go make some money first,"" the first lady told her husband. Another young man said he had been accepted at the University of Florida and was waiting to hear from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He said he planned to go to law school and then, smiling at the president, ""maybe do what you do.""  ""I'm just warming the seat for you,"" Mr. Obama replied. Like many of the initiatives Mr. Obama has announced since his State of the Union speech, the student aid application program is an executive action that does not require congressional legislation. While the students cheered obligingly, they seemed more excited by the prospect of taking ""selfies"" with Mr. Obama than by filling out a form. As is true for all presidents, the job will follow Mr. Obama to Key Largo. The White House has installed a battery of communications equipment in rented villas here, and the deputy national security adviser, Antony Blinken, will brief the president daily on the situation in Ukraine. Mr. Obama, aides said, could always opt to go home early. But, Mr. Earnest said, ""We have complete confidence that the president can handle all the responsibilities he has.""

3873,1553699640.xml,"       DONETSK, Ukraine --  The Ukrainian military on Sunday moved into the heart of the separatist hub of Luhansk for the first time, officials said, chipping at one of the cornerstones of the pro-Russia rebels' disintegrating virtual state. Ukrainian officials said army units had raised the national flag over a police station in central Luhansk, the eastern city that, along with Donetsk, has been a center of rebel activity and an important destination for Russian fighters and aid. Other parts of Luhansk, however, were still said to be under rebel control. The claim could not be independently confirmed, though a photograph of the flag and police station was circulating on social media, and the report was consistent with the progress of fighting there going into the weekend. Along with increased Ukrainian pressure on rebel positions in Donetsk, the army's move into Luhansk focused attention on the profound reversal of the separatists' fortunes since they declared independence in April. Interviews across eastern Ukraine portray a rapid breakdown in discipline in the rebel ranks. Many fighters have abandoned their uniforms in favor of civilian clothes, and three senior leaders have left the war zone in recent days. Even as Ukrainian officials in Kiev celebrated the developments, and as international foreign ministers met in Berlin to try to ease the crisis with Russia, there was increased worry that the Kremlin would take the rebels' disintegration as an incentive to intervene more forcefully in Ukraine, perhaps setting off a wider war. ""It's a case of being very, very, very careful what you wish for,"" said Cliff Kupchan, an analyst with the Washington-based Eurasia Group, speaking of Western officials who have endorsed the Ukrainian military option. If President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia believes ""the rebels are about to get routed, we do have a problem,"" Mr. Kupchan said. A large Russian convoy said to be carrying humanitarian aid to Luhansk remained at the Ukrainian border on Sunday, and movements there were being closely watched. Western officials have warned that pushing the convoy through would be taken as a belligerent act by Russia. In Berlin, the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met to discuss a settlement to the four-month-old conflict, which Russia stoked after a pro-West government took power in Kiev in the wake of street protests. In a telephone call with the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Saturday that Russia should clarify a statement by the separatist prime minister in Donetsk, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, who claimed he had received reinforcements from Russia. Russia has denied sending soldiers or weapons into eastern Ukraine. Mr. Zakharchenko said rebels would receive 150 armored vehicles and 1,200 soldiers who, he said, had spent four months training in Russia. ""They are joining at the most crucial moment,"" Mr. Zakharchenko said. In a radio interview on Sunday, a spokesman for Mr. Putin denied Mr. Zakharchenko's claim that a new supply of arms and fighters had been brought across the border from Russia. ""We have said repeatedly that no equipment is being supplied there,"" the spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said in the interview on the Moscow Speaks radio station. Though the Kremlin has steadfastly denied supplying the separatists in eastern Ukraine, insurgent leaders on several occasions have spoken openly about support from Russia, and at times have complained about the quality of weapons and ammunition they received. Besides the advance in Luhansk, the Ukrainian military made another critical move, capturing the town of Yasinovataya, a strategic railway hub north of Donetsk. The army has tightened its siege on Donetsk in recent weeks, and inside, a breakdown in discipline among the hard-pressed rebel fighters had locals on edge. Residents said rebel fighters had taken to carousing drunkenly at night and wearing civilian clothes at checkpoints, a change that would allow them, at a moment's notice, to throw down their weapons and blend in with the population. Ukrainian police at a checkpoint on Sunday reported capturing four separatists dressed as Orthodox priests, making their way toward Russia. And on Saturday night, rebels drunkenly fired pistols in a street outside the Havana Banana bar, causing guests to dive under their tables for cover. Earlier this month, three drunken separatists crashed a car into the curb outside the Ramada hotel, ejecting two people from the car, and on Saturday two separatists crashed at the same spot, rolling their vehicle and scattering shorn-off car parts, broken glass and bullets on the street. In an interview, a deputy minister of defense of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Fyodor Berezin, conceded that problems were emerging but insisted that the force could still defend the city. ""You understand, hundreds of people got weapons and felt power, and didn't understand it was for a purpose,"" he said of the erratic shooting that has now become general. ""They thought, 'Now I have a machine gun, I have power,' and they didn't understand they had a function: to fight the enemy, and not terrorize the population or rob people."" In recent weeks, as the Ukrainian military has steadily advanced against the rebels in the east, officials have often spoken about the possibility of creating a corridor that would allow insurgent fighters who had arrived from Russia to put down their weapons and retreat back across the border. The seemingly imminent defeat of the rebels also raised the possibility that the huge convoy of trucks waiting to bring aid from Russian to civilians in Luhansk and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine might also be used to carry fighters and weapons out of the country. During random inspections by journalists, a number of the trucks have turned out to be mostly empty, and Russian officials have not offered much explanation other than to say they were trying to account for the possibility that some trucks might break down. The convoy has been mostly parked at a military base near the border, but 16 of the more than 200 trucks moved closer to the line on Sunday, stopping near a border checkpoint. Officials in both countries said there was still no agreement to let the convoy cross into Ukraine. In the past week, three senior rebel leaders have left the war zone, in moves seen as setting the stage for a possible negotiated settlement by removing contentious personalities or Russian citizens from top positions. In Luhansk last week, the prime minister and military commander of the Luhansk People's Republic, Valery Bolotov, announced in a recorded video address his ""temporary resignation"" as leader and departure for Russia for medical treatment. Aleksandr Borodai, a Russian citizen, stepped down and was replaced by Mr. Zakharchenko. Mr. Borodai later announced that a fellow Russian who had been the military commander, Igor Girkin, who uses the nickname Igor Strelkov, or Igor the Shooter, had also resigned and a Ukrainian citizen appointed in his place. Mr. Borodai said Mr. Strelkov had left the eastern Ukrainian war zone for a ""vacation,"" and would return. Credit: ANDREW E. KRAMER; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Moscow.

2866,433540322.xml,"      Ask Marc Bongers about the wisdom of introducing a speed limit on the German autobahn, and he answers by impatiently revving the 435-horsepower engine of a specially modified Porsche. Slowpokes, he said, already spoil half the fun. ''A lady,'' Mr. Bongers sniffed, as a Mercedes scuttled out of his way in the passing lane on a busy highway in southern Bavaria. ''And she's talking on her phone,'' he said the other day, shooting her a sidelong glance. ''Doesn't she know it's against the law to do that on the autobahn?'' With a stretch of empty road ahead, Mr. Bongers floored the gas pedal, and within seconds the speedometer registered 286 kilometers an hour (178 m.p.h.) -- something that is still legal here. That, by way of comparison, is about the speed of a commercial jet taking off. Few things are closer to the German heart than the freedom to drive like Michael Schumacher, the fabled Formula One champion. Rule-bound and risk-averse in so many other ways, Germans regard driving on the autobahn at face-peeling speeds as close to an inalienable right. Now, though, Germany's love of speed is colliding with its fears about global warming, as it becomes clear that its Sunday race-car drivers are spewing tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Last week, the European Union's environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas of Greece, set off a national debate here by suggesting that the German government introduce a general speed limit on the autobahn. To be sure, at least half of the 7,500 miles of autobahn already have either permanent or temporary speed limits. But the autobahn's anything-goes stretches are the world's fastest public roads. ''Speed limits are useful for many reasons, and are the order of the day in most of the E.U.'s 27 member states and the United States,'' Mr. Dimas said in an interview with the mass-market newspaper Bild. ''Strangely enough, it is only in Germany where they are controversial.'' No kidding. His mild words were met with heated indignation from politicians and automotive groups here. Some acted as if Brussels were demanding that Germany outlaw beer and bratwurst. This is ''a trivialization of the climate problem,'' declared the German environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel. The German Association of the Automotive Industry said Germans needed ''no coaching'' from other Europeans on how to protect the environment. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has put climate change at the top of her agenda as current president of the European Union and the Group of 8 industrial nations, opposes a uniform speed limit. She is hardly a car buff. Unlike her predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, she is rarely photographed behind the wheel. But she seems to realize that, like Social Security in the United States, the autobahn is the third rail of German politics -- potentially deadly to those who dare touch it. Critics brandish statistics that show a speed limit of 120 kilometers an hour (75 m.p.h.) would reduce Germany's overall carbon-dioxide emissions by a few million tons a year, less than 0.5 percent. Better, they say, to focus on building more efficient power plants and houses. Yet, as environmental groups and a few lonely politicians point out, a few million tons of carbon dioxide is still a considerable savings. Unlike other measures -- clean coal plants or hybrid cars, for example -- a speed limit could be imposed tomorrow and at relatively little cost. ''Our politicians like to say that Germany should not have to do more than other European countries on climate change, but in this area, we are doing less,'' said Josef Goppel, one of the few conservative members of Parliament who favor a limit. For years, speed limit advocates tried to argue their case on safety grounds. The autobahn, though, is statistically safer than highways in many countries, even if its crashes are singularly horrific. Saving the planet, it turns out, may be more persuasive than saving lives. ''Given the pride of Germans about being No. 1 in protecting the environment, this could lead to a breakthrough,'' said Peter Schneider, a writer who limits himself to 90 m.p.h. on the autobahn. Mr. Schneider is realistic. Driving fast, he said, is deeply rooted in the German psyche -- a form of expression that survived even World War II. It is an addiction that crosses social and political boundaries. ''I have friends who are left-leaning intellectuals, and they're proud to tell me they can get to Hamburg from Berlin in two hours,'' Mr. Schneider said. (That requires driving an average of 87 m.p.h.) Germany also has a powerful economic incentive to resist a speed limit. It builds some of the world's fastest cars, and the autobahn is a valuable showcase and marketing tool for the industry. A tour operator even organizes driving tours of the highway for Chinese visitors. Car connoisseurs from around the world flock to Pfaffenhausen, a one-horse town where the local company, Ruf Automobile, makes cars with many horses. Mr. Bongers, the sales manager, said people who bought these custom-modified Porsches often took them for a spin on the autobahn. For most, it is the only place they can legally test the top speed of their new toys. ''It's a kind of freedom,'' said Mr. Bongers, 40, who once pushed his own Porsche 911 to over 187 m.p.h. to prove he had the guts to do it. ''Speed is relative on the autobahn.'' Alois Ruf, a courtly, nattily dressed man who took over the family business from his father in 1974, said he did not know enough about the science to judge whether a speed limit would significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But the debate feels oddly familiar to him. In the depths of the oil crisis in late 1973, West Germany imposed a speed limit of 100 kilometers an hour (60 m.p.h.). Four months later, the government rescinded it. Mr. Ruf recalls worrying during those dark days that the family's sports car business was doomed. ''This is a dream we are selling to the world,'' he said. ''It's a tradition I think we have to defend.''  The autobahn near the Czech border.

3323,2597649188.xml,"In a sign of volatile East-West relations, a dispute over shopping in the Ukrainian conflict zone spiraled into fighting that sent war jitters rippling through Europe and the U.S. HRANITNE, Ukraine -- Artillery shells fired by Russian-backed separatists shrieked into this small town deep in the flatlands of eastern Ukraine, shearing branches from trees, scooping out craters, blowing up six houses and killing one Ukrainian soldier.It was an all-too-common response to the smallest of provocations --  a dispute over grocery shopping for a hundred or so people living in the buffer zone between the separatists and Ukrainian government forces. But in the hair-trigger state of the Ukraine war, minor episodes can grow into full-fledged battles.Hunkered down in a bunker, the Ukrainian commander, Major Oleksandr Sak, requested a counterstrike from a sophisticated new weapon in Ukraine's arsenal, a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drone.Deployed for the first time in combat by Ukraine and provided by a country that is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the drone hit a howitzer operated by the separatists. Things quickly escalated.Across the border, Russia scrambled jets. The next day, Russian tanks mounted on rail cars rumbled toward the Ukrainian border. Diplomacy in Berlin, Moscow and Washington went into high gear.The sudden spike in hostilities last month underscored the tenuous nature of the cease-fire that exists along the 279-mile front in the Ukraine war. It set off a new round of ominous warnings from Moscow, and highlighted President Vladimir V. Putin's willingness to escalate what is known as hybrid conflict, a blend of military and other means for creating disruption -- including exploiting humanitarian crises like the current one on the Polish-Belarusian border.The drone strike in Hranitne also raised fears in Western capitals that Russia would use the fighting as a pretext for a new intervention in Ukraine, potentially drawing the United States and Europe into a new phase of the conflict.""Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory, and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told journalists in Washington last week.The battle came at an increasingly volatile moment in the conflict. This fall, commercial satellite photos and videos posted on social media have shown that Russian armored vehicles had massed near the Ukrainian border; Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has estimated the buildup at 100,000 troops. And Russian rhetoric toward Ukraine has hardened.Amid this heightened tension, the drone strike in particular became a flash point for the Kremlin. Alarmed that Ukraine possessed this highly effective new military capability, Russia called the strike a destabilizing act that violated the cease-fire agreement reached in 2015.Mr. Putin has twice in the past week pointed to the drone attack as a Ukrainian escalation, justifying a potential Russian response. He raised the issue in a phone call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Asked on Saturday about accusations from Washington that Russia was massing troops on the Ukraine border, Mr. Putin responded by criticizing the United States for supporting the drone strike, as well as for conducting a naval drill in the Black Sea, which he called a ""serious challenge"" for Russia.""A sense is created that they just aren't letting us relax,"" he said. ""Well, let them know we are not relaxing.""Mr. Putin has long made clear that he views Ukraine as inseparable from Russia. In July he published an article outlining that doctrine, describing Russia and Ukraine as ""essentially"" one country divided by Western interference in the post-Soviet period, an apparent justification for Russian-Ukrainian unification. Russia has already annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.""We will never allow our historical territories and people close to us living there to be used against Russia,"" he wrote.Hacking, electoral meddling, energy politics and a recent migrant crisis on the border of Belarus and Poland have all strained ties between the West and Russia. But nowhere are the tensions more overt than in this conflict zone that cuts through villages and farmland, where opposing soldiers -- one side backed by the United States, the other by Russia -- face off.Russia intervened militarily in Ukraine after street protesters deposed a pro-Russian Ukrainian president in 2014. Moscow sent soldiers wearing ski masks and unmarked uniforms to the Crimean Peninsula, whipping up the rebellion in the east in two separatist enclaves, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.The frontline in the war is sometimes called a new Berlin Wall, a dividing line in today's geopolitics. It is an eerie realm of half-abandoned towns, fields and forests.It is also a tinderbox that requires only a match to spark new hostilities. In late October, the buffer zone near Hranitne provided one.In most places along the front, a scant few hundred yards separate two trench lines. But in some areas, including Hranitne, the gap widens to a few miles, and people live in between the two armies, in a no-man's-land known in Ukraine as the ""gray zone."" Residents must cross the Ukrainian trench line to shop and send their children to school, protected by an uneasy truce. Residents are aware of the danger, but are too poor to move.""It's scary,"" said Oleksandr Petukhov, a retiree as he cleared the last checkpoint one recent day carrying a bag of cheese and eggs. ""This is a ridiculous situation.""In Hranitne, the access point for shopping on the Ukrainian side is a footbridge over the Kalmius River, a slow-moving flow of inky green water. Ukrainian soldiers peek out from above sandbag parapets as shoppers trickle across the bridge.The troubles began about a month ago when separatists closed a checkpoint on their side -- where local residents also traveled for shopping -- for unclear reasons, possibly as a coronavirus precaution.In response, on Oct. 25, Volodymyr Vesyolkin, the administrator of Hranitne, a position akin to mayor, led a contingent of about a dozen soldiers across the footbridge. The same day, the military laid concrete blocks for a new bridge about 700 yards away that would be accessible for vehicles.His motive, Mr. Vesyolkin said, was humanitarian: to assure locals of access for shopping and deliveries of coal for winter heating.""How can it violate anything?"" Mr. Vesyolkin said in an interview. ""This is our village. These are our people. They walk several kilometers to buy groceries.""The separatists interpreted it otherwise -- as a land grab -- and soon their artillery shells filled the air.Even Ukrainian military officers concede a misperception was possible. ""They maybe thought we would send heavy weapons"" across the new bridge, Major Sak said.Through the night and into the next morning, a separatist unit with 122-millimeter artillery guns fired toward Ukrainian forces in what is known as a shoot-and-scoot maneuver intended to skirt counterattacks by the enemy.In total, the separatists fired about 120 rounds at the unfinished new bridge, but every shot missed. They hit nearby houses instead, destroying one with such force that it appeared turned inside out, with a pile of cinder blocks covering the street.Major Sak said he requested the drone strike because it was the only weapon that could hit the maneuvering enemy artillery and because civilians were in danger, though none were hit.""Only modern weapons allow us to halt Russia's aggression,"" he said in an interview.Most military analysts say flare-ups in Ukraine are more a pretext for strategic saber-rattling than a cause. But they are sparks in an already dangerous world, and the West remains on high alert this week as Russia takes an increasingly bellicose stance toward Ukraine.When the fighting in Hranitne subsided, the villagers emerged with at least one small victory: they finally got their groceries.Two days after the drone strike, separatists opened their checkpoint, allowing the Red Cross to deliver 50-pound boxes of food to each house. The boxes held rice, sugar, sunflower oil, macaroni, flour and cans of meat and fish.Tatyana Yefesko, an elementary schoolteacher, said she appreciated the delivery. But it was hardly a long-term solution.""Any small flare-up could turn into a big war,"" she said. ""Everybody asks, 'Why did this happen? Who needs this?' I don't know. But history shows us every big war started with something small.""Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Hranitne, Ukraine.In the town of Hranitne, Ukraine, the access point for shopping for about a hundred people living in the nearby buffer zone is a footbridge crossing the Kalmius River.; Above, the remnants of a rocket that landed in Hranitne.

712,1680652922.xml,"       The big winner of last week's election in Britain was unquestionably David Cameron, whose upset majority took pollsters completely by surprise. But running a close second was Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the Scottish National Party. By taking 56 seats in Scotland, she transformed her party, which led the campaign for Scottish independence in September 2014, into the third-largest bloc in the House of Commons and herself into a force to be reckoned with. ""Transformed"" being an operative word. Because since last November, when Ms. Sturgeon became the party leader, she stepped not only out of the shadow of her mentor, Alex Salmond, the party's former leader, but also out of her former subdued trouser suits, donning a de facto mantle of power: not a red ermine-rimmed cloak but a neat red pencil-skirt dress. As well as a lightened Angela Merkel-style blond bob. In its echoes of what has become the accepted uniform of female leaders everywhere, left or right no matter, her image evolution signaled her ambitions and revealed the way women are using clothing to manage their transition to power (as well as exposing our own less salubrious prejudices). ""It's a soft power look,"" said Holly Mitchell, a founder and designer, along with Lynsey Blackburn, of the Edinburgh boutique Totty Rocks, who met Ms. Sturgeon when the first minister bought one of their dresses and a matching jacket around the time of her swearing in. Ms. Sturgeon has since been pictured in, among others, their Betty dress (available on their website for 179 pounds, or about $277), their Blitz dress (which she wore to watch the election results come in, also £179) and their Bow dress (£159). All share the same basic characteristics: bright colors, straight knee-length skirts, three-quarter sleeves and a complete lack of controversy. The apparel blueprint was established by Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000 when, after a much-chronicled, and much-maligned, period of wardrobe experimentation when she was the first lady, she settled into a familiar trouser-suit groove as a senator, one based on an elongated jacket shape with a bit of variety in material and detail. (There's a reason her Twitter profile includes the term ""pantsuit aficionado."") But it really achieved prominence with Ms. Merkel's rise in 2005, when the German chancellor adopted what has become her signature: a pair of straight-cut trousers and contrast three-button jacket with diagonal pockets courtesy of the German designer Bettina Schoenbach. And it reached critical mass when Dilma Rousseff, the president of Brazil, took a similar approach during her first presidential campaign, in 2010 (and thereafter), with an unfailing allegiance to three-quarter-length-sleeved jackets over simple dresses and trousers. Ms. Sturgeon's wardrobe differs slightly from that of the above troika thanks to its slightly more feminine detailing (as well as her penchant for higher-than-usual heels, often by the British label Kurt Geiger), but the overall impression is the same. It is effectively the female equivalent of the male suit combined with a strategic use of color, as first employed by Queen Elizabeth II, who realized that hat-to-heel bright shades made her stand out in a crowd. Together this creates a quasi uniform whose familiarity and subconscious accessibility combat the increasing noise around female dress, while nevertheless acknowledging, and exploiting, a certain level of gender differentiation (David Cameron and Jeb Bush can't exactly wear a tangerine suit, no matter how much they might like to). It doesn't move the needle (it doesn't break open the options of what women can wear without inviting opinion, and you can debate the merits of that kind of bowing to acceptability), but it does blunt its point. It allows the subjects to choose their battles. Put simply: written one pencil-skirt, three-quarter-sleeved jacket suit critique, written 'em all. And that moves the conversation from one about clothes to one about policies, and it does it without any associated carping about appearance-related sexism (which can be a rabbit hole unto itself), but simply by attrition. ""People went from criticizing the first minister's clothes to appreciating them,"" Ms. Mitchell of Totty Rocks said of Ms. Sturgeon's wardrobe transformation. ""And then they started listening to what she was saying."" Bennet Ratcliff, a political consultant and a founder of Thaw Strategies, who has worked on campaigns from Colombia to Arkansas, says: ""Voters take comfort from the idea someone is assuming the familiar mantle of leadership. They see it, even if they don't identify exactly what they are seeing. Fashion changes the way they think about candidates on a very personal, subconscious level."" It can also (and this is not immaterial in the electoral context) work to soften the edges of what may be more extreme rhetoric by framing the speaker in an entirely centrist visual language. The voice may be saying one thing, but the clothes are conveying another. None of this has escaped Ms. Sturgeon, who has been upfront about the role that fashion plays in politics. In April, for example, she gave an interview to ITV's ""Tonight"" show, in which she said, ""You have to be thinking about what you're wearing, but you don't want to be thinking about it at the expense of what you really need to be thinking about."" Given the difference between her before and after looks, this was a smart admission: It answered any charges that she had been managed by image consultants, as it put the responsibility for what Pamela Gillies, the vice chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University, calls Ms. Sturgeon's ""redesign"" squarely on her own shoulders. Playing dumb in the clothes game isn't really a credible position anymore. And it may be partly why Ms. Sturgeon has remained loyal to Totty Rocks, where Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Blackburn are now responsible for, they said, 80 to 90 percent of the first minister's public wardrobe. Working within a given framework of her own preferences, they tailor her choices to the occasion (literally; most of her clothes are now bespoke), often sending her swatches and sketches, and sometimes even sewing an outfit at the last minute. Thus, for the sole televised seven-way British electoral leader debate, which took place in April, after they found out the set was a ""harsh blue,"" they outfitted her in a warm red coral jacket with gold buttons and a matching dress, the better to make her stand out. According to the YouGuv poll taken just after the debate, Ms. Sturgeon was the surprise winner, swaying 28 percent of watchers. Since then, Ms. Mitchell said, Totty Rocks has received email requests from women as far away as Singapore and New Zealand who want to ""get the look."" This is the way power dressing spreads.

669,1973304446.xml,"ROME -- Pope Francis said, ""I cannot remain silent."" The United Nations secretary general spoke of his ""great anxiety."" The European Union expressed ""serious concern."" American allies like Britain, France, Germany and Italy all declared it a mistake.A chorus of international leaders criticized the Trump administration's decision on Wednesday to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it a dangerous disruption that contravenes United Nations resolutions and could inflame one of the world's thorniest conflicts.
Secretary General António Guterres and Pope Francis both expressed alarm that the announcement would provoke new tensions in the Holy City, which is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.
Within minutes of Mr. Trump's speech, in which he said the American Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Guterres delivered what amounted to a diplomatic rebuke.
Reading a statement outside the Security Council chambers at United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres criticized ""any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,"" underscoring the administration's departure from decades of American policy.
""Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,"" Mr. Guterres said.
""In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: There is no alternative to the two-state solution,"" he said. ""There is no Plan B.""
In Rome, Pope Francis prayed that Jerusalem's status be preserved and needless conflict avoided.
""I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days,"" Francis said at his weekly general audience at the Vatican. ""And at the same time, I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.""
""Jerusalem is a unique city,"" he said, ""sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated, and it has a special vocation to peace.""
In especially strong language, the pope added, ""I pray to the Lord that such identity be preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the entire world, and that wisdom and prudence prevail, to avoid adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.""
The European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, expressed concern about ""the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace.""
In a statement, she reiterated the bloc's position that Jerusalem should be a future capital of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, and that embassies should not be moved there until the city's final status was resolved. She cited a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israel's attempted annexation of East Jerusalem as a violation of international law.
She called on actors in the region ""to show calm and restraint in order to prevent any escalation.""
Within a few hours of Mr. Trump's speech, eight countries on the 15-member Security Council -- including some of America's closest allies -- requested an emergency meeting to be held before the end of the week. Diplomats said it would most likely be scheduled for Friday.
Joakim Vaverka, political coordinator of Sweden's United Nations mission, said in a statement that the delegations of Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay had sought the meeting, including a briefing by Mr. Guterres, ""in light of the statement today by the president of the United States regarding the status of Jerusalem.""
The warnings by the pope, the United Nations and the European Union spoke to a broad fear that Mr. Trump's announcement would be the death knell for an already moribund peace process and that it would pull the plug on a two-state solution.
Critics of the announcement said the change in policy removed any pretense that the United States is a neutral broker for peace. Palestinians and other Arabs in the region already view the Trump administration as leaning toward Israel's right-wing government. The change in American policy ""destroys the peace process,"" said the Palestinian prime minister, Rami Hamdallah.
Some of the United States' closest allies expressed apprehension.
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called Mr. Trump's decision ""unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.""
President Emmanuel Macron of France, who was in Algeria on Wednesday meeting with the country's president and other figures, said in a news conference that the decision by Mr. Trump was ""regrettable"" and that ""France and Europe are committed to a two-state solution."" He called on all parties to refrain from violence.
Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, said through a spokesman that her government ""does not support this position, because the status of Jerusalem is to be resolved in the framework of a two-state solution.""
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy wrote on Twitter: ""Jerusalem holy city, unique on earth. Its future will be defined within the framework of the peace process based on the two states, Israel and Palestine.""
In China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Geng Shuang, expressed support for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and urged all parties to the conflict to proceed cautiously. ""What we worry about is any potential flare-up of regional tensions,"" he said. ""The status of Jerusalem is a complicated and sensitive issue.""
Britain's foreign minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters in Brussels, ""Clearly this is a decision that makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward.""
That process, led by Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has seemingly failed to get off the ground.
Leaders in the region had already warned against the move. A statement from the royal palace of King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose kingdom is the custodian of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, emphasized that the city was critical to ""achieving peace and stability in the region and the world.""
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was convening a summit meeting of the main Pan-Islamic body next week in Istanbul to discuss the American move and to show, as his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in Ankara, ""joint action among Islamic countries.""
Mr. Kalin called the expected change a ""grave mistake,"" adding that ""Jerusalem is our honor, Jerusalem is our common cause, Jerusalem is our red line.""
Iran, unsurprisingly, condemned the change. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said at a conference in Tehran on Wednesday that it reflected the ""incompetence and failure"" of the American government.
Like much of Europe, the Vatican has long been sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians. The Vatican established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1994, and Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Israel and the Palestinian territories.
In 2012, the Vatican called for ""an internationally guaranteed special statute"" for Jerusalem, with the goal of ""safeguarding the freedom of religion and of conscience, the identity and sacred character of Jerusalem as a Holy City, (and) respect for, and freedom of, access to its holy places.""
Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014, but he upset some Israelis by flying by helicopter directly from Jordan to the ""State of Palestine,"" as the Vatican schedule at the time referred to the territories. He visited Israel afterward.
In 2015, the Vatican entered into a treaty with the ""State of Palestine.""
On Tuesday, Francis spoke by telephone to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, about the unfolding crisis. Before the pope's public remarks to the faithful at the Vatican on Wednesday, he met privately with a group of Palestinians participating in interfaith dialogue with officials at the Vatican.
""The Holy Land is for us Christians the land par excellence of dialogue between God and mankind,"" he said. ""The primary condition of that dialogue is reciprocal respect and a commitment to strengthening that respect, for the sake of recognizing the rights of all people, wherever they happen to be.""

1302,1019461953.xml,"      MADRID -- Responding to increasingly urgent calls from across Europe and the United States, Spain on Saturday agreed to accept a bailout for its cash-starved banks as European finance ministers offered an aid package of up to $125 billion.   European leaders hope the promise of such a large package, made in an emergency conference call with Spain, will quell rising financial turmoil ahead of elections in Greece that they fear could further shake world markets.   The decision made Spain the fourth and largest European country to agree to accept emergency assistance as part of the continuing debt crisis. The aid offered by countries that use the euro was nearly three times the $46 billion in extra capital the International Monetary Fund said was the minimum that the wobbly Spanish banking sector needed to guard against a deepening of the country's economic crisis.   On Sunday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tried to deflect criticism for his government's decision to seek assistance for Spain's ailing bank. The winners, he said,  were ""the credibility of the European project,  the future of the euro, the solidity of our financial system and the possibility that credit will flow again.""   But he warned  that Spain's economic problems would worsen  this year despite the request. ""This year is going to be a bad one,"" Mr. Rajoy told reporters, according to The Associated Press.  More people, he said, could lose their jobs -- one out of every four Spaniards is already unemployed.   Mr Rajoy also insisted that the rescue deal should not be seen as the fourth bailout in the euro crisis but as a loan  to recapitalize Spain's weakest banks, ""which isn't that easy to obtain.""   The announcement of a deal came amid growing fears that instability in Spain could drag down an already sputtering world economy. The decision was the culmination of weeks of a contentious back-and-forth between Spain and its would-be creditors in which it was hard to tell how much of Spain's resistance to financial help was tactical maneuvering for a better deal and how much a refusal to admit the depth of the banking sector's troubles.   The escalating tension prompted President Obama to push Friday, in unusually explicit terms, for quick European action.   European officials have said they wanted their offer to go well beyond Spain's immediate needs to shield the country from any destabilizing effect from next weekend's Greek parliamentary election. Spain has fought to avoid the stigma of a bailout and on Saturday portrayed the Europeans' offer as coming with few strings attached. Although the European statement on the aid package gave few details, it did not mention new austerity measures and said the conditions of the agreement were focused instead on banking reforms, as Spain had requested.   Spanish officials on Saturday denied that their country was in the same position as Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which have all received bailouts that demanded they slash spending. And on Sunday, Mr Rajoy  rejected suggestions that Spain had been pushed to request help ahead of new Greek elections on June 17 that could precipitate Greece's withdrawal from European monetary union.   ""Nobody pressured me, I was the one who pressured to get credit,"" Mr Rajoy said.   Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, said at a news conference Saturday in Madrid that the assistance ""allows us to have an ample safety margin"" and ""will return trust and confidence to the euro project.""   The deal to shore up Spain's banks is only the latest in a marathon crisis that has seen one stopgap solution after another over the last three years. The 11th-hour fixes have always given way to new speculation about the long-term solidity of the currency union, and European leaders remain deeply divided about the way to carry out a more lasting solution. Ahead of a summit meeting this month, members of the euro zone are debating a variety of fixes related to forming a tighter political and fiscal union.   The amount of the financing package is expected to be completed after two consulting firms publish their audit reports on Spanish banks on June 21.   The maximum figure of $125 billion was intended to cover the ""estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin,"" according to the statement issued by euro zone finance ministers. The statement also said that the euro group ""supports the efforts of the Spanish authorities to resolutely address the restructuring of its financial sector.""   Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said the scale of the proposed financing ""gives assurance that the financing needs of Spain's banking system will be fully met."" And the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, called the support European partners were showing Spain ""important for the health of Spain's economy."" He said that Spain's request for aid and Europe's agreement were ""concrete steps on the path to financial union, which is vital to the resilience of the euro area.""   ""It's a calming signal at a time when calming signals are badly needed,"" said Jens Boysen-Hogrefe, an economist at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. But Mr. Boysen-Hogrefe said it did not solve the underlying problems of Spain or the euro area as a whole. ""The uncertainty is still high and bad news can pop up anywhere in the euro area. This is not a final solution.""   Many financial analysts expect the Greek elections next week to spook the already unsettled markets and test the very cohesion of the euro zone.   Before Saturday, Mr. Rajoy had tried to hold out against the withering pressure of capital markets, which drove up Spain's borrowing costs, and the lobbying of European leaders, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, to come up with a plan to recapitalize the banks hit worst by the bursting of Spain's property bubble. Mr. Rajoy wanted the rules changed, or at least bent, so the money went directly to the banks and Spain could claim more convincingly it had not received a bailout.   The money, however, will be channeled through the Spanish bank-bailout fund, and the Spanish government will ultimately be responsible and will have to sign the memorandum of understanding and the conditions that come with it.   Still, Mr. de Guindos said that, based on his discussions with euro zone ministers, he expected the terms of the emergency loan to be ""very favorable."" He noted that not all of Spain's banks would need help, adding that ""the problem that we face affects about 30 percent of the Spanish banking system.""   European leaders have underscored previously, and reiterated in their statement on Saturday, that Spain had made significant budget cuts and labor market reforms. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, praised the steps undertaken thus far, calling the teleconference ""constructive"" and saying in a statement that ""Spain is on the right path and Germany, just like the other countries and institutions of the euro zone, as well as probably the I.M.F., will support Spain on that way.""   Robert Tornabell, a banking professor at the Esade business school in Barcelona, said that despite the government's insistence to the contrary, ""What has just been agreed is in fact a bailout, just like what had to be done for Ireland because of its banking problems.""   He said Spain's rescue request would ""clearly hurt"" the credibility of the government of Mr. Rajoy, as well as that of the Bank of Spain, following their repeated claims that Spain would not require European emergency funding in order to keep its banking sector afloat. Still, Mr. Tornabell said, ""This is good news for our banking system, as is the fact that the euro group is not imposing such strict conditions and seems willing to offer Spain an interest rate well below that of the market.""   The real test will begin when financial markets reopen Monday and, in particular, when Spain tries to borrow money again from private lenders. The country's borrowing costs have been pushed to close to record highs in part because of the problems at its banks, which are struggling under the weight not only of significant losses in their real estate loan portfolios, but also the country's broader economic malaise.   By resisting harsh bailout conditions, Mr. Rajoy was hoping to escape Greece's fate. Tough conditions there have caused political upheaval, with the left-wing party led by Alexis Tsipras vowing that if it comes to power, it will refuse to live up to the nation's bailout terms.   European officials hope an infusion of cash for Spain's banks will strip some uncertainty from the markets, which will be agitated enough if Mr. Tsipras's party wins.

249,433955714.xml,"      AT the turn of the 20th century, toward the end of a brutal and surprisingly difficult victory in the Second Boer War, the people of  Britain began to contemplate the possibility that theirs was a nation in decline. They worried that London's big financial sector was draining resources from the industrial economy and wondered whether Britain's schools were inadequate. In 1905, a new book -- a fictional history, set in the year 2005 -- appeared under the title, ""The Decline and Fall of the British Empire.""   The crisis of confidence led to a sharp political reaction. In the 1906 election, the Liberals ousted the Conservatives in a landslide and ushered in an era of reform. But it did not stave off a slide from economic or political prominence. Within four decades, a much larger country, across an ocean to the west, would clearly supplant Britain as the world's dominant power.   The United States of today and Britain of 1905 are certainly more different than they are similar. Yet the financial shocks of the past several weeks  --  coming on top of an already weak economy and an unpopular war  --  have created their own crisis of national confidence.   On Friday, as the stock market finished one of its worst weeks by falling yet again, to roughly half of its level just one year ago, the Gallup Poll reported that Americans were substantially more pessimistic about the economy than they have been in more than two decades of polling. Nearly 60 percent say the economy is in poor shape, and 90 percent say it's still getting worse.   ""One thing seems probable to me,"" Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, said recently. ""The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the global financial system."" At another time, that remark might have sounded like mere nationalist bluster. Right now, it doesn't seem so ridiculous to ask whether 2008 will come to be seen as the first year of a distinctly non-American century.   At the heart of the troubles, both short term and long term, is debt. Debt helped create the housing bubble and has now left almost one of every six homeowners with a mortgage larger than the value of their home. Debt built up, and then laid low, modern Wall Street, where firms borrowed $30 for every $1 they owned. And in the coming years, debt will constrain the United States government, as it copes with the combined deficits created by the Bush administration's policies, the ever-more expensive financial rescue and the biggest item of all, Medicare for the baby boomers.   In essence, households, banks and the government have already spent some of their future earnings. The current crisis marks the point at which  the bills begin to get paid. Whereas Britain lumbered under the weight of imperial overreach, as the historian Niall Ferguson has written, the United States will be shackled primarily by its financial overreach.    ""Given the burden of debt that has accumulated, it's hard to see the U.S.  economy growing as fast as it did over the past few decades,"" Mr. Ferguson said. ""There is a profound mood shift occurring.""   But he added two caveats. The political language of both presidential campaigns makes clear that many voters, for all the current pessimism, still believe in the idea of American pre-eminence. So, apparently, do many of the world's investors.   In recent weeks, the dollar has held its own. Stocks in every other major country are down about as much over the last year as they are in the United States, if not much more. America may not be a safe haven anymore, but it does seem to be safer haven.    Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said that he was recently speaking to a senior Chinese economist, who said that people in his home country --  today's rising economic power  --  don't see the sky falling on the American economy. ""They know its ability to turn around problems is really unmatched, historically,"" Mr. Zoellick said, quoting the economist about the United States. ""At the same time, they ask themselves, Will the United States get at some of the root causes that could determine its real strength over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years?""   This is not the first time in recent history that the economic position of the United States has appeared precarious. At various points between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, Europe and Japan each looked like the next great power. Neither turned out to be.   Japan suffered through its own burst bubble and spent years denying the depth of its problems. Europe proved unable to create engines of growth that could match the software, biotechnology or entertainment industries in the United States.    Taken to its extreme, the American preference for a faster, riskier capitalism led directly to the current crisis. But that preference also helps  explain why America  is weathering the crisis at least as well  as other countries.   Compared with many banks elsewhere, American banks uncovered their problems fairly quickly. Consider the case of Mr. Steinbruck, the German finance minister. Only two weeks ago, around the time that he was predicting the end of American financial dominance, he rejected calls for a Europe-wide bailout. The crisis, he said, was largely American. Last Sunday, Mr. Steinbruck and Chancellor Angela Merkel had to go before television cameras to assure Germans that their government was guaranteeing their savings.    (On Friday, Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, seemed to deliver a message to the Germans in an op-ed article in   The Wall Street Journal: ""The days of finger pointing and schadenfreude are over."")   Policy makers in this country have also seemed behind the curve for much of the last year. On Friday, only a week after Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, dismissed the idea as unwise, Mr. Paulson said the government would buy stock in financial firms.  The British government announced a similar plan on Tuesday.    On the whole, though, American officials have been more aggressive than their overseas counterparts, and that has served as a reminder of the American economy's durable flexibility.    It is possible, then, that the main legacy of the crisis will be some form of corrective to the country's recent excesses. The economy looks to be heading into a period of more regulated, but still American-style, capitalism, more along the lines of how it operated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1990s. Those three decades happen to have produced the biggest and most widely shared economic gains since World War II.   But if that outcome is possible, it's not inevitable, and many economists say it isn't even likely. The debts run up in recent years are particularly unfortunate, because they stole resources from the future without laying the groundwork for future growth. ""If you told me we were spending like crazy to build schools and send everyone to college, that would have infinitely different implications than borrowing like crazy to finance current consumption,"" said Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.    Schools, roads, airports and the medical system, as well as the country's energy policy, all appear to need significant fixing, and yet there will be less money to fix them than there was  5 or 10 years ago. With the coming explosion in Medicare costs, the federal budget deficit could eventually get so large that foreign investors would get spooked. They might then decide that other economies were safer bets and shift more of their lending there. Were that to happen, and the United States struggled to attract financing, the country would face a whole new crisis.   As it is, the Chinese economy has grown so quickly in recent years that it could overtake the American economy as the world's largest by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs. Just three years ago, Goldman predicted that China was unlikely to become No. 1 until at least 2040.    Some of this catch-up is inevitable. As in the British Empire's day, poorer countries are able to attract investment thanks to their low wages and also copy the successes of their richer rivals, notes Benjamin Polak, an economic historian at Yale. China still seems considerably less advanced, relative to its rivals, than the United States was in 1905. China remains a politically insecure, deeply unequal country.   But it is indeed making enormous progress, and that progress has consequences. Economic might translates quite directly into political and military might.   Will that prospect be enough to galvanize a serious response to the  long-term economic problems in the United States? Or are there still more crises to come?    ""The political system does not deal well with gradual, long-term problems,"" Peter Orszag, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said. ""It deals with crises, often imperfectly, but it does deal with them. The current experience makes the case.""

1822,2059394169.xml,"If you haven't already noticed, let me be the first on your block to point it out: The big mainstream political parties across the industrialized world are all blowing up at once. It's quite extraordinary.The U.S. Republican Party has blown up in all but name, going overnight from an internationalist, free-trade, deficit-hawk party to a protectionist, anti-immigrant, deficit-dove party -- all to accommodate the instincts of Donald Trump and his base.As the former House Speaker John Boehner noted: ""There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere."" Actually, it's dead, but it's not alone in the cemetery.Italy's last election ended with its mainstream center-left getting crushed, bringing to power instead a coalition of far-left, far-right populists, whose focus ranges from guaranteeing minimum income for Italy's 11 percent unemployed to rebuffing immigrants and the European Union.Britain's Labour Party has gone from center-left to quasi-Marxist. And the Brexit-loving Tories, having pushed Britain to exit the E.U. without any plan, are now divided and paralyzed over how to implement the economic suicide they've promised voters.The U.S. Democrats are fractured between a Bernie Sanders quasi-socialist wing and a center-left wing, but are glued together for now -- thank goodness -- by the overriding need to defeat Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel took four months to form a barely coherent governing coalition, after her ruling party got hammered in the last election -- and that fragile coalition may soon implode over immigration tensions. And French President Emmanuel Macron leads a centrist party that did not exist three years ago.As Quartz noted, the French Socialist Party ""went from running the country to receiving just 6 percent of the vote in the first round of presidential elections last year."" In the Netherlands, the Labor Party has been decimated, going from 25 percent of the vote in 2012, and governing in a coalition, to just 6 percent in last year's general election.What's going on? My short answer: climate change -- but not just the one you think. We're actually going through three climate changes at once, and together they are reshaping the ecosystems of work, learning, geopolitics, ethics and community in ways that parties built on our old left-right binary choices can no longer easily contain.How so? We're going through a change in the climate of the climate: We're going from later to now. When I was growing up in Minnesota, later was when I could clean that lake, save that forest or rescue that endangered owl. Today later is officially over. Later will now be too late, so whatever you're going to save, save it now. That's a climate change.We're going through a change in the climate of globalization: We're going from an interconnected world to an interdependent world. In an interdependent world your friends can kill you faster than your enemies. If banks in Greece or Italy -- both NATO allies -- go under tonight, your retirement fund will feel it. And in an interdependent world, your rivals falling becomes more dangerous than your rivals rising. If China takes six more islands in the South China Sea tonight, you won't lose sleep; if China loses 6 percent growth tonight, you could lose your job.Lastly, we're going through a change in the climate of technology. Machines are acquiring most of the unique attributes of humans -- particularly the ability to learn, analyze, reason, maneuver and drive on their own.From 1960 to 2000, Quartz reported, U.S. manufacturing employment stayed roughly steady at around 17.5 million jobs. But between 2000 and 2010, thanks largely to digitization and automation, ""manufacturing employment plummeted by more than a third,"" which was ""worse than any decade in U.S. manufacturing history."" And we've digitized only about 20 percent of the economy, meaning there's tremendous technological climate change yet ahead.These climate changes are reshaping the ecosystem of work -- wiping out huge numbers of middle-skilled jobs -- and this is reshaping the ecosystem of learning, making lifelong learning the new baseline for advancement.These three climate changes are also reshaping geopolitics. They are like a hurricane that is blowing apart weak nations that were O.K. in the Cold War -- when superpowers would shower them with foreign aid and arms, when China could not compete with them for low-skilled work and when climate change, deforestation and population explosions had not wiped out vast amounts of their small-scale agriculture.Today, though, without those props, the most fragile nations are fracturing, like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras south of us and in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East south of Europe. There is not enough order, sustainable land or industry to hold people on their farms or big cities. And this is creating the most relevant geopolitical divide in the world today: the divide between the World of Order and the World of Disorder. In Europe the boundary is the Mediterranean, and in the Americas it's the Rio Grande.And the number of people -- now armed with cellphone pictures and directions from human traffickers -- trying to get out of the World of Disorder into the World of Order is at all-time highs, producing nationalist/populist backlashes in America and Europe.This is all new and accelerating. But the big Western parties that dominated politics since World War II tended to be built around a set of rather stable left-right binary choices: the interests of capital versus labor; big government, high regulation versus small government, low regulation; a more closed national outlook hostile to free trade and immigration versus a more open internationalist outlook open to free trade and immigration; social norms to be embraced and social norms to be banned, like gay marriage and abortion; and economic growth versus environmental protection.Ruling and opposition parties tended to be combinations of these big binary choices. But nowadays they just can't contain and balance many of the new choices that parties, citizens, companies and communities have to make to thrive amid all these climate changes.If I work at a steel mill and am a member of the steel union Monday through Friday -- but on Saturday I drive for Uber and on Sunday I rent out my spare bedroom on Airbnb -- are my interests with capital or labor, with more government regulation or less?If I am a regional electric utility led by Republicans for decades -- but am now investing in wind and solar because they've become cheaper than new coal and my customers are demanding climate-protecting clean energy -- am I for Trump's tariffs on the cheap Chinese solar panels and his efforts to force me to keep using coal?Which party has a plan to pay for education in an era when lifelong learning is now vital for lifelong employment? How do we fund the kind of ""perpetual education"" that The Washington Post reported on recently, like the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, which just ""launched a scholarship program that pays for graduates to take classes there forever, and the number of students is slowly growing.""I detest Trump's policy of separating immigrant kids from their parents. But how do Democrats think we're going to manage the flow from the World of Disorder? In its annual report last week, the United Nations refugee agency said there is a record-high 68.5 million migrants, including 25 million refugees, wandering the world. And how do Republicans think we're going to keep these people in their homes when Trump opposes all climate change mitigation and family-planning assistance for the developing world and most foreign aid?These old knee-jerk positions won't work anymore. We can't just wall ourselves off, and we can't just take in all the tired and poor who now want to come. Just as we had a Marshall Plan to stem the spread of Communism in Europe after World War II, we now need something similar to stem the spread of disorder coming from the south and help people stay at home. It will require wholly new ways of thinking about geopolitics, and neither of our traditional parties is doing that.One can see three different broad approaches playing out in response to these very new, complex political choices. One is leaders who want to build walls, against change and immigrants, who galvanize support by generating tribal solidarity.A second you can see in Macron or in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign website. They offer a smorgasbord of technocratic-pragmatic solutions -- many of which make a lot of sense but lack any emotional grip on voters.The third approach is the one that you can see emerging organically in certain towns and communities across America. It is highly pragmatic in its approach to problem-solving but fosters solidarity not by conjuring old party loyalties or a new tribalism. It generates its idealism and solidarity instead through the trust and bonds of friendship that come from doing big hard things together in the community.I call these community-led projects complex adaptive coalitions -- where business, labor, educators, philanthropists, social entrepreneurs and mayors are all working together to build more adaptive local citizens and companies, and setting aside traditional party affiliations to do so.They are not waiting for Washington or their state governments, but are acting in their own local collective self-interest, nurturing adaptation from the bottom up.These efforts are the most hopeful things happening in America today.In next week's column I'll take you to one of places the approach is working best: Lancaster, Pa.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

871,2412672068.xml,"After a week of demonstrations against racism in Europe, far-right counterdemonstrators turned out on Saturday and attacked the police in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson denounced the ""racist thuggery.""LONDON -- Thousands of people rallied against police brutality and racism in European cities on Saturday, punctuating a week of protests across the continent, but far-right demonstrators also emerged in large groups for the first time -- particularly in London -- leading to sometimes violent confrontations that included attacks on police officers.The anti-racism marches and rallies in Europe, energized by demonstrations in the United States in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, have led to destruction of statues linked to slavery and demands for a reckoning with racial discrimination. The European protesters have denounced the bigotry within their own countries and demanded that the authorities address it.But Saturday was the first day when far-right groups and protesters, most of them white, fiercely pushed back. The situation grew especially tense in London, where crowds of white male counterprotesters clashed repeatedly with the police.Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who just a day earlier had criticized the anti-racism demonstrations and exhorted Britons to avoid them, denounced the far-right attacks on the police as ""racist thuggery."" Mr. Johnson said the protest marches had been subverted by violence and declared that ""racism has no part in the U.K.""The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that more than 100 people had been arrested by day's end for offenses that included ""breach of the peace, violent disorder, assault on officers, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of class A drugs, and drunk and disorder.""The protest and counterprotest came to an explosive head in Trafalgar Square, when small numbers of Black Lives Matter supporters and their antagonists threw bottles and booming fireworks against one another, while the police tried to separate them.Parliament Square, where thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters had gathered just a week ago, was filled on Saturday with hundreds of overwhelmingly white male counterdemonstrators. Many said they had assembled to prevent attacks targeting the statues in the square, especially that of Winston Churchill.""People are defacing my history and my culture,"" said Dave Allen, a 30-year-old lawyer from London who had joined the counterprotest. ""That's why these people are here, because we feel we're getting attacked.""Videos shared on social media showed mounted police officers standing guard in Parliament Square in front of boarded-up statues and repelling far-right protesters who threatened and punched them.The confrontations in London came days after racism protesters tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, in Bristol, and others scrawled ""racist"" on a Churchill statue in Parliament Square.The statue of Churchill, a usually revered figure in Britain who steered the country through World War II, was later covered to protect it. Mr. Johnson called the episode ""absurd and shameful"" in a Twitter posting on Friday in which he acknowledged Churchill had ""sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial.""In Paris, some 15,000 people rallied to demand justice for Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old who died in 2016 after the police had arrested him. Amid the overwhelmingly young crowds, demonstrators waved signs reading ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" less than two weeks after 20,000 protesters had assembled in front of a Paris court for Mr. Traoré. The Saturday protests were organized by ""The Truth For Adama,"" an advocacy group led by Mr. Traoré's sister, Assa Traoré. The rally remained largely peaceful, although police officers threw tear gas and clashed with protesters in the late afternoon.""In France, we have a tendency to deny thorny issues like race,"" said Isabelle Blanche, a 41-year-old black protester who came with her brother. She said that it had taken Mr. Floyd's death in the United States ""for people to finally wake up.""Wearing a black T-shirt bearing the inscription ""Justice for Adama,"" Océane Loimon, an 18-year-old black protester, blamed the French authorities for refusing to address police brutality, but as she pointed to the crowds on the plaza, she said: ""They cannot ignore it anymore.""As in London, the atmosphere in Paris had grown tense earlier in the afternoon when far-right activists unfurled a large red banner reading ""White Lives Matter"" on the roof of a building of the plaza. The crowd below chanted ""No justice, no peace,"" in response, and later cheered residents who tore down the lower part of the banner with chisels and knives. Some threw fireworks at the far-right activists, who were later chased off the roof by a handful of protesters.Similar protests in Lyon ended in confrontations with the police, who fired tear gas in response to protesters who threw bottles and stones at them, according to local media reports.Some demonstrations also were held in Germany including the city of Stuttgart, but they were much smaller than those of previous weekends.Across Europe, governments have walked a thin line throughout the week in trying to quell public anger.The leader of a German opposition party, the Greens, has called for a change of wording in the country's Constitution to include a provision that no one should face discrimination on the grounds of ""racism."" Chancellor Angela Merkel and her justice minister signaled this week that they would be open to a public debate on the change, which would require support from two-thirds of Parliament.But the authorities have otherwise urged people to avoid protesting and to stay home in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 167,000 people in Western Europe and dragged the continent into its worst economic slump since World War II.The police in Paris reminded the public that gatherings of more than 10 people were forbidden, and they asked businesses and restaurants to close near the Place de la République, where thousands remained on Saturday in defiance of the police barricades leading to the plaza.Many protesters were unfazed by the warnings. ""I'm less afraid of the coronavirus than I'm afraid of being killed by the police,"" said Cécilia Ranguin, a 20-year-old law student, who is black.Saturday evening, France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, reestablished the right to protest, provided that protesters respect health measures like mask-wearing and social distancing and that the gathering does not exceed 5,000 people.In London, the police urged people to avoid demonstrating in the city and set a 5 p.m. deadline for all protesters to leave the defined demonstration routes.""I absolutely understand why people want to make their voices heard,"" Bas Javid, the Metropolitan Police commander, said in a statement. ""But the government direction is that we remain in a health pandemic, and people are asked not to gather in large groups.""As the 5 p.m. curfew approached, the police were taking measures to ensure that the right-wing groups were kept separate from the Black Lives Matter protesters.The presence of far-right counterprotesters on Saturday added a new layer of complexity to an already tense situation in Britain and France, where demonstrators' demands have been met with resistance from police forces, who argue that instances of racism by their members have been isolated episodes.After France's interior minister on Monday promised ""zero tolerance"" of racism in the police and proposed a ban on chokeholds -- a tactic that is increasingly prohibited in the United States, where protests continue -- the French police contested the ban and other reforms by staging a demonstration of their own on Friday, in which they threw down handcuffs at stations across the country.Dialogue between protesters and the authorities in Europe has been infrequent. While demonstrators in Britain called on their country to acknowledge its racist and imperialist history, Mr. Johnson has accused those who wanted to remove statues of trying to ""edit or censor our past.""But there are also signs that politicians in Europe are heeding protesters' calls.Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokeswoman for France's government, said on Saturday that the country had not brought an end to racism and that discrimination should be discussed more openly. In an opinion piece in the newspaper Le Monde, Ms. Ndiaye -- who was born in Senegal and moved to France as a teenager -- said the country needed to tackle ""the reality of the suffering"" that minorities endure.As the protest neared a conclusion in Paris, protesters confronted police forces. ""We are not afraid,"" Ms. Traoré chanted, as the truck she stood on drove back to the center of the plaza, and parked in front of a cordon of armor-clad police forces.Iliana Magra reported from London, and Elian Peltier and Constant Méheut from Paris.

580,1944502949.xml,"BERLIN -- As the results of Germany's election last Sunday flashed on her television screen in the western city of Cologne, Kirsten Schindler, watched with a mixture of confusion and dismay.For the first time in decades, a far-right party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, had broken into the Parliament, winning nearly 13 percent of the vote. Celebrating, its leading candidate, Alexander Gauland, pledged to ""take back our country and our people.""Ms. Schindler, a professor of linguistics at the University of Cologne, felt that all the postwar lessons of tolerance and acceptance of her western German upbringing were now suddenly at risk.""I kept thinking the whole time, who are 'our people?""' she said. ""He doesn't mean me.""The outcome of the election has given her country equal pause. The result has ushered in a moment of national soul-searching over what post-World War II Germany is today, and whether its sense of a unique historical burden for Nazism and the Holocaust is felt as deeply as it once was.At the very least, the vote has forced many Germans to realize that their country, despite its past, is not immune to the tug of nationalism and populism that has challenged liberal democracies across Europe and in the United States.Many Germans bridled at the thought. Within minutes of the election results, German-speaking social media responded with a campaign promoting the 87 percent who did not elect the far-right.Some noted the comparison with the United States, where a right-wing populist, Donald J. Trump, won the election, or France, where the far right made it to the final round of presidential voting this year.Compared with many of its European neighbors, Germany's far-right force remains a minority. But an analysis of the returns also shows that in all but one of 299 polling districts the AfD earned at least 5 percent, reflecting widespread, if not necessarily deep, support.That revelation is a sobering reality for those Germans who believed that liberal democracy was an unshakable moral compass for their modern, reunified country.""Now I have the impression there is no longer any consensus anymore,"" Ms. Schindler said.Germany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has warned against allowing the vote to drive a wedge in society, insisting that now is not the time for anyone ""to retreat to their own niche shaking their heads.""But the map of where the AfD enjoyed its strongest support also reveals clear lines of division that have split the country throughout its history.One is the divide between the largely Roman Catholic southern states, where conservatives turned their backs on Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union.The other cuts along the former East-West border of the Cold War, with support for the AfD by far strongest in the former East Germany, where the party also made its strongest showing ever in regional elections last year.Johannes Staemmler, now in his mid-30s, was born and raised in Dresden, the capital of the eastern state of Saxony, where the AfD emerged as the strongest force, with 27 percent of the vote.From his home in Berlin, he recognized immediately whom Mr. Gauland meant by ""our people"" -- it was his former schoolmates, neighbors and family members in the east.In the first two decades following reunification, the region's population dropped by two million, many of them young people like him who had moved west looking for jobs.Referring to an idea laid out by J. D. Vance in the book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Mr. Staemmler said that while church, family and country serve as mainstays of community in the American Midwest, such anchors are missing in the former Communist east.""In the east, there is no church, families are splintered because so many young people have moved away and the state is not viewed as representing them,"" Mr. Staemmler said.""So when Gauland says, 'let's be proud of Germany, let's take back our country, let's put our country first,' he is serving their need for identity, for community,"" he said.Others placed the blame squarely on Ms. Merkel.""Through the gutting of her party, in which she drove out any and all conservative positions, she opened up space on the right fringe, sending unhappy conservatives into the arms of right-wing populists,"" Stefan Kuzmany wrote in an editorial  commentary in Spiegel Online.Still others lay the fault not with the policies of the governing parties but with their inability to take the far right seriously. They never stopped to consider what made the party attractive to voters.""The traditional parties were too relaxed about the rise of the AfD -- too sluggish,"" said Dieter Hoffmann, 71, a retired former teacher from Berlin. ""I think at the next election, we'll perhaps have less of the AfD, because the other parties will have realized what the people want.""Julian Reichelt, a digital editor at the country's most widely read newspaper, Bild, drew on the image of stopped-up school toilets -- a perennial theme in the German press -- to illustrate the disconnect between voters and the politicians who are supposed to represent them.""Such imperative daily realities rarely made it into the election,"" Mr. Reichelt wrote in an editorial.Nor did women's increasing fears of walking city streets alone, or the inability to speedily deport migrants who have no case for legal asylum, he noted.Politicians' failure to address such basic concerns during the campaign, he said, ""made many people utterly, needlessly angry.""But the anger of the minority has now fed the fears of the majority. An investigation by the influential left-leaning Die Zeit found that roughly a third of the AfD's 93 lawmakers can be considered nationalist conservatives, along the lines of Mr. Gauland, their far-right leader.An additional 13 AfD lawmakers were found to have ties to extreme-right political groups, including the Identitären, who are under observation by the country's domestic intelligence service.Martin Hohmann is the only AfD lawmaker to have previously served in the German Parliament, until he was kicked out of the Christian Democrats in 2003, for blaming Jews for the deaths caused by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917.The return of such voices to Parliament has caused concern among many Jews in Germany and Europe.Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called on the centrist forces in the German Parliament to defend their democratic values and resist the attempts by the AfD to provoke them.""I expect our democratic powers to reveal the true face of the AfD and expose the empty, populist promises of the party,"" Mr. Schuster said.While some have branded the AfD Nazis -- in the weeks before the vote Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister said ""real Nazis"" would be entering Parliament -- others warn that the term does not necessarily shed light on the new populist movement in Europe.""There is a hard-right core that is extremely nationalistic, but unlike the Nazis, not murderously nationalistic,"" said Michael Wolffsohn, a professor of modern history at the University of the German Armed Forces in Munich.Much of the far right's emergence had to do with the anxieties provoked by a ""demographic revolution,"" Mr. Wolffsohn said. ""Change frightens many people.""He added: ""When fear grows, irrationality grows. That is at the heart of this new right-wing phenomenon.""The bulk of those who will represent the AfD in Parliament are virtual political unknowns, leaving some Germans to take a wait-and-see approach.Although the AfD has vowed to be a disruptive force in Parliament, Mr. Gauland acknowledged the responsibility the party now faces.""Of course the language of an election campaign is different than the language in Parliament,"" he said.Others hoped that a turn in government would ultimately lead the AfD to self-destruct, or self-correct.""The Left Party was just as despised early on, or even the Greens,"" Mr. Hoffmann said. ""Today, it's the AfD, and if they have any sense, they will expel the extreme forces from their party and become just a typical conservative party.""Follow Melissa Eddy on Twitter @meddynyt.MELISSA EDDY   Follow Melissa Eddy on Twitter @meddynyt.

2079,433621988.xml,"      Devotees of Richard Wagner's operas have no trouble sitting through long hours of intense music and convoluted plots, but even they may be tiring of the extended family power struggle over control of the Wagner Festival held in Bayreuth, Germany, every summer. This year's festival, which began on July 25, has brought new twists to the plot, suggesting that a final curtain may be nigh -- or at least coming closer.   Founded in 1876 by Wagner himself, the Bayreuth Festival has had a colorful and at times unsavory history, not least when it was embraced by Hitler. But despite this, Bayreuth remains a kind of shrine for Wagner lovers, and they care passionately about its future. At the heart of the current drama is who will succeed the composer's 87-year-old grandson, Wolfgang Wagner. He took over the festival with his brother, Wieland, in 1951 and has run it as a personal fief since Wieland's death, in 1966. But his management has come under growing criticism in recent years. Tradition has it that the festival is always run by a Wagner, and this time round, the main candidates are again all in the family: Eva Wagner-Pasquier, 62, Wolfgang Wagner's daughter from his first marriage; Katharina Wagner, 29, Wolfgang's daughter from his second marriage; and Nike Wagner, 62, Wolfgang's niece and Wieland's daughter. At first glance, the choice appears to be between youth and experience. Katharina Wagner has only recently begun directing opera, while Ms. Wagner-Pasquier is artistic adviser to the Aix-en-Provence opera festival in southern France, and Nike Wagner, a musicologist by training, is director of the Weimar Festival in Germany. But there is a bitter twist: Wolfgang Wagner is so determined to impose Katharina as his successor that he now refuses to speak to Ms. Wagner-Pasquier or to Nike Wagner. The outcome is in the hands of the Richard Wagner Foundation, which owns the festival's theater, the Festspielhaus, and subsidizes the event. But while Wolfgang has only one vote on a 24-member board dominated by German, Bavarian and Upper Franconian officials, he has so far had his way with the foundation. Now, with his health failing and demands for a clear succession mounting in the German press, the question is whether the foundation will take up the issue this fall, and, more specifically, whether it will dare to flout the will of the festival's ruling patriarch. The last time it tried to do so, it was simply ignored. In 2001, after Wolfgang indicated a willingness to step down, the foundation chose Ms. Wagner-Pasquier over Nike Wagner and Wolfgang's second wife, Gudrun, as the festival's new director. When his wife was rejected for the job, Mr. Wagner responded by announcing that the position was his for life. He further indicated that if necessary, Gudrun would succeed him until Katharina, then just 23, was ready to take over. Now, to prove she is ready, Wolfgang has allowed Katharina to direct her first opera at Bayreuth. Her new production of ''Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg'' opened the monthlong festival last week before an audience packed with Wagner experts and German V.I.P.'s, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. Although Katharina has previously directed Wagner and Puccini operas in other cities, her maiden show at Bayreuth was widely viewed as a kind of public audition for her father's job. The intense booing that met her when she appeared onstage at the final curtain suggested that it had become more of a trial by fire. Certainly, ''Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg'' was a daring assignment for the youngest director in the festival's history. Not only is it Wagner's only comedy, but it is also a paean to what it calls ''Holy German Art'' and, as such, became Hitler's favorite opera and the only work performed in Bayreuth in 1943 and 1944. Ms. Wagner tackled the opera's dark association with German nationalism by satirizing luminaries of German culture like Bach, Beethoven, Goethe, Schiller and even Wagner himself. But European critics said much of the audience turned against her in the last act, when she resorted to topless dancers, full male nudity, plastic phalluses and a bizarre auto-da-fe. Some critics noted that cheers could be heard among the boos, but their reviews were generally negative. Andrew Clark in The Financial Times of London called it ''an intermittently titillating but ultimately depressing show,'' and Der Spiegel's critic was reminded of ''a flat Wagner pizza -- a thick topping on a thin base.'' Still, it is unclear how the public and critical response will affect Ms. Wagner's bid to run the festival. In the past, some new productions at Bayreuth have been booed before later being acclaimed. At the same time, Katharina, a statuesque blonde nicknamed Bayreuth Barbie by her traditionalist foes, can probably still count on the support of those who believe that Bayreuth needs a youthful shake-up. Certainly, during rehearsals, she displayed no insecurity, inviting reporters to watch her work, releasing glamorous studio photographs of herself and telling a news briefing, ''I don't think I'm too young anymore.'' After last Wednesday's opening night, she added, ''Being booed belongs to the job description of a director.'' Meanwhile, her two competitors are again preparing to make their cases to the Wagner Foundation. Ms. Wagner-Pasquier has always avoided public mud-slinging, but her cousin Nike has spoken dismissively of Katharina, saying she has a ''ready-made nest'' and describing her opera productions as ''old wine in a new wineskin.'' For the moment, the Wagner Foundation has given no hint that it is ready to name a new festival director, although there is widespread speculation in the German press that its board will meet for this purpose after the current festival ends on Aug. 28. One fresh sign that change is in the air came last week at the annual meeting of the Friends of the Bayreuth Festival, which has two seats on the Wagner Foundation's board. For the first time Wolfgang Wagner did not attend the meeting, and for the first time the Friends openly criticized his management style.  Eva Wagner-Pasquier, the older daughter of Wolfgang Wagner.

3318,1902381802.xml,"BRUSSELS -- President Trump on Thursday punctured any illusions that he was on a fence-mending tour of Europe, declining to explicitly endorse NATO's mutual defense pledge and lashing out at fellow members for what he called their ""chronic underpayments"" to the alliance.On a tense day when Mr. Trump brought the ""America first"" themes of his presidential campaign to the very heart of Europe, he left European leaders visibly unsettled, with some openly lamenting divisions with the United States on trade, climate and the best way to confront Russia.The discord was palpable even in body language. When Mr. Trump greeted Emmanuel Macron, France's new president, they grabbed each other's hands, jaws clenched, in an extended grip that turned Mr. Trump's knuckles white. When the leaders lined up to pose for the traditional photograph at NATO headquarters, Mr. Trump appeared to push aside the Montenegrin prime minister, Dusko Markovic, to get to his assigned place in the front.The split was starkest at NATO headquarters, where Mr. Trump used the dedication of a soaring new building to lecture allies on their financial contributions. Far from robustly reaffirming NATO's mutual defense commitment in the way that many members hoped he would, Mr. Trump repeated his complaint that the United States was shouldering an unfair burden.""Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense,"" Mr. Trump declared, as the leaders shifted uncomfortably behind him, shooting one another sidelong glances.""This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,"" he added. ""And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.""Standing before a large piece of twisted wreckage from the World Trade Center that will serve as a memorial at the headquarters, Mr. Trump promised to ""never forsake the friends that stood by our side"" in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks -- a pledge that White House officials later said was an affirmation of mutual defense.But to European leaders, Mr. Trump's words fell far short of an explicit affirmation of NATO's Article 5 clause, the ""one-for-all, all-for-one"" principle that has been the foundation of the alliance since its establishment 68 years ago, after World War II.""I think he was stingy with the U.S. commitment and very generous with his criticisms,"" said Fabrice Pothier, a former head of policy planning at NATO and a senior associate at Rasmussen Global, a political consulting firm.White House officials said Mr. Trump's message on financial contributions had galvanized NATO to confront the issue. At a closed meeting after his speech, they said, the leaders unanimously approved a resolution on burden-sharing and on fighting terrorism.""To see unanimous support for the two main priorities of the president is a great way to start it off,"" said Sean Spicer, the press secretary. ""When you have an entire meeting that is focused on the president's agenda, that shows the power of his message.""Publicly, though, the other leaders appeared less gratified than bewildered. During a photo-taking session, none of them spoke to Mr. Trump, except for the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Afterward, several surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has emerged as the strongest counterweight to the president.Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump, a blunt critic of the European Union during his campaign, received a chilly reception from his European counterparts as they began meetings in Brussels.His first meeting with the Continent's leaders began with officials from the United States and Europe saying nothing to each other. After being welcomed to Brussels, Mr. Trump said, ""Thank you very much,"" but he was otherwise silent as he gazed at the cameras across the room.Donald Tusk, who represents leaders of the bloc's 28 member states as president of the European Council, made it clear after the morning meeting that there had been several areas of disagreement.""Some issues remained open, like climate and trade,"" Mr. Tusk said after the meeting at the European Union's lavish new headquarters. ""And I am not 100 percent sure that we can say today -- 'we' means Mr. President and myself -- that we have a common position, common opinion, about Russia.""In the talks, Mr. Trump and Mr. Tusk differed over the intentions and policies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. That reflects growing anxiety in Europe over what appear to be Russia's efforts to meddle in elections here and in the United States.The subject of Russia did not come up in a broader meeting between American and European officials, said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council. But Mr. Anton said he could not speak for a smaller meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Tusk and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.The White House put a more positive spin on the day, saying the leaders had discussed ways to deepen cooperation in fighting the Islamic State and reaffirmed ""the strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.""Climate change is another bone of contention, however. European leaders are turning up the pressure on Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord that was ratified last year.The campaign began on Wednesday at the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave Mr. Trump a copy of his influential encyclical on protecting the environment, and the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, urged the president not to withdraw from the accord.Mr. Trump told Vatican officials that he had not made a final decision and that he was not likely to do so until after a Group of 7 meeting this weekend in Taormina, Sicily, according to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president's senior advisers have been deadlocked for months over whether the United States should withdraw.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was among those who said he planned to press Mr. Trump on climate change.""One of the things that we understand in Canada is that investing in clean energy and investing in fighting against climate change is going to help us,"" Mr. Trudeau said, citing efforts by governments and businesses to find ways to avoid polluting the planet.Mr. Trump's handling of Article 5 epitomizes the gulf between him and other leaders. His steadfast refusal to endorse it as a candidate, and later as president, has raised fears among NATO allies about whether the United States would come to their defense in the event of an attack.Other American officials have offered reassurances. Mr. Tillerson told reporters traveling on Air Force One this week, ""Of course we support Article 5."" But until Mr. Trump speaks those words, leaders of other NATO nations seem bound to remain concerned.Instead, Mr. Trump criticized the other leaders for not contributing 2 percent of their countries' gross domestic product to their defense, as they have agreed to do but have often fallen short of. He even took a shot at the new headquarters, a vast glass-and-steel edifice that looks like a series of interconnected airplane hangars.""I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I refuse to do so. But it looks beautiful.""In 2014, NATO members agreed to increase their defense spending gradually to meet the 2 percent of G.D.P. goal, with 20 percent of that spending on military equipment. Those commitments have not changed, and after remaining flat in 2015, spending increased last year among non-American alliance members.The alarm in Europe over Mr. Trump's presidency has diminished since the days immediately after his election, in part because emissaries like Mr. Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence have reaffirmed American support for NATO and the European Union.But Mr. Trump, who once described Brussels as a ""hellhole"" overrun with radicals, remains an object of deep suspicion in the city. For some of the European leaders, testing Mr. Trump seemed to be as important as finding common ground with him.Credit: MICHAEL D.

4180,433977674.xml,"      President-elect Barack Obama turned down an invitation from President Bush to attend a global economic summit meeting this weekend, but he designated a team of surrogates on Wednesday to meet with visiting foreign delegations on his behalf.   Madeleine K. Albright, right, who served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton, and Jim Leach, a former Republican congressman from Iowa who endorsed Mr. Obama during the campaign, will get together in ""unofficial meetings"" with leaders or their advisers from some of the Group of 20 top economies while they are in Washington, Mr. Obama's office said.   ""This weekend's summit is an important opportunity to hear from the leaders of many of the world's largest economies,"" Denis McDonough, Mr. Obama's senior foreign policy adviser, said in a statement.

2698,917022504.xml,"      WASHINGTON   A DEMOCRATIC president running in a bitterly disputed presidential race faces a fateful national security decision: whether to approve an airstrike to thwart an adversary bent on becoming a nuclear-weapons state.   Conservative hawks deride the president as weak. In the West Wing, advisers debate the risks: a strike could lead to open conflict, but doing nothing would change the balance of power in a volatile, war-prone region.   The president was Lyndon B. Johnson, and less than three weeks before Election Day in 1964, the Chinese rendered the White House discussion moot by setting off their first nuclear test. ""China will commit neither the error of adventurism, nor the error of capitulation,"" the government of Mao Zedong told the world that morning, heralding the first Asian nation to get the bomb.   Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the election anyway, after a campaign in which -- oddly enough, given the attack being contemplated -- he tarred the Arizona conservative as a warmonger in the infamous black-and-white ""daisy"" television spot, featuring a young girl counting the petals of a flower, unaware of impending nuclear doom.   Historical analogies are always dangerous when it comes to presidential elections and nuclear geopolitics, so comparisons to the Obama administration's calculus in the escalating confrontation with Iran calls to mind the caution that history doesn't repeat, it rhymes. The election-year nuclear brinkmanship game was tricky enough in the cold war; the Chinese test was partly a warning to the Soviet Union, and Washington had even considered inviting Moscow to join in any strike.   But think of the multipolar chess President Obama is now playing. Every country involved in the dispute over Iran's possibly acquiring nuclear weapons is calculating how the American presidential election plays to its agenda. The politics of soaring oil prices loom over any threat of military conflict, even a brief skirmish in the Strait of Hormuz. And with global economic turmoil a reality and leadership changes possible or certain this year in the United States, Russia, China and France, the game gets even more complex.   Start with the Iranians themselves. They have studied China's example, and the case of Pakistan, which faced severe economic sanctions -- urged foremost by the United States -- for its pursuit of the bomb. But in both cases, once those countries conducted a test, the world adjusted to the new reality. Less than a half century later, China is the world's second largest economy, and no one messes with it. As soon as the Sept. 11 attacks happened, the sanctions against Pakistan disappeared; suddenly the United States cared about cooperation in hunting down Al Qaeda more than it cared about Pakistan's dangerous export of bomb technology, including to Iran.   ""From the perception of the Iranians, life may look better on the other side of the mushroom cloud,"" said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He may be right: while the Obama administration has vowed that it will never tolerate Iran as a nuclear weapons state, a few officials admit that they may have to settle for a ""nuclear capable"" Iran that has the technology, the nuclear fuel and the expertise to become a nuclear power in a matter of weeks or months.   No one can get inside the head of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but Mr. Takeyh notes that his pattern of behavior over the past decade has been to push the nuclear program ahead ""systematically but cautiously,"" slowly raising the temperature but until now avoiding major crises. Several years ago the Western allies said Iran could not resume enriching uranium; it resumed. Then the ""red line"" was drawn around enriching at a much higher level of purity, which gets Iran closer to bomb-grade fuel. But Iran has been doing that for nearly two years now. And the latest violation, just two weeks ago, was beginning production in a deep underground facility that is far less vulnerable to bombing.   That moves the calculus to Israel. It used to declare that it would never permit Iran to go past ""the point of no return,"" an ill-defined line beyond which Iran could rapidly produce a bomb. There's continuing debate about where that line is, but former Israeli intelligence officials say Iran is long past it. Yet so far, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been constrained by the United States, which argues that cyberattacks, sabotage and sanctions have been more effective at slowing Iran's program, without creating an international furor.   The outbreak of a public debate in Israel over whether to strike soon clearly shook the Obama administration. Under pressure from American officials, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, said on Wednesday that a decision on a possible strike on Iran was ""very far off."" Mr. Netanyahu's government may calculate that if Israel is going to attempt a strike, doing so during the presidential campaign, when it would have the sympathy of many American voters, is the only way to avoid a major backlash from Mr. Obama, with whom Mr. Netanyahu has a tense relationship. Elliott Abrams, President George W. Bush's hawkish Middle East adviser, wrote recently that if Israel attacked ""Mr. Obama would be forced to back it and help Israel cope with the consequences. It might even help the president get re-elected if he ends up using force to keep the Strait of Hormuz open and Israel safe.""   IT might -- or it might not. The Iranians know they have little to gain from a confrontation that spins out of control; they don't want to take on the Fifth Fleet in the Strait of Hormuz. But threats, small attacks on refineries and harassment of shipping can send the price of oil soaring, with economic effects no leader wants in election season. Sure, Americans don't want Iran to get the bomb. But are they willing to pay $6 a gallon to prevent it?   Instability scares the Chinese, too, but gives the Russians an opportunity. For years China resisted sanctions on Iran, since it buys so much Iranian oil. Now it sees that escalating sanctions are inevitable, so it is busy hedging its bets, looking for alternative sources (with help from the Obama administration) while delaying a crisis. ""They are a little late to the game,"" one of Mr. Obama's aides said. ""We have been telling them this was coming for two years now. But they are only now believing it.""   Russia is also looking to buy time, but as a significant oil producer, it benefits from a sustained crisis -- as long as it stays at a low boil. The Russians have proposed a lengthy negotiating plan with Iran, one that would take years to complete. Washington sees it as a ploy that would drag out talks and give Iran time and political cover to get the bomb.   And then there are the Europeans and the Arab states. During the Bush administration they feared any tough sanctions, convinced that if they failed, President Bush would order a strike on Iran. They misread the politics in Washington; after invading Iraq, Mr. Bush was in no position to get into a conflict with another Middle Eastern country suspected of seeking nuclear weapons.   Now, exactly three years into the Obama administration, the situation has reversed. Europe is finally as eager for sanctions as Washington has been; it is preparing for an oil embargo on Iran. The United States has not purchased oil from Iran for many years, but Mr. Obama has stopped short of advocating a global total embargo, which could lead to confrontations at sea. The hard line taken by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been the surprise in the latest chapter in the long-running Iranian nuclear crisis. Their operating assumption is that if the economic cost is high enough, the supreme leader will fold. Few in Washington are persuaded, but most go along with the assumption because the more forceful alternatives are too unpleasant to contemplate.   By comparison, solving the Iranian hostage crisis during the presidential election of 1980 looks almost simple. Hours after Jimmy Carter left office and the more hawkish Ronald Reagan came in, Iran freed the hostages taken at the American Embassy. When Mr. Obama or his opponent is sworn in on Jan. 20, 2013, no one expects Iran's nuclear complex to be packed up and shipped out.   DAVID E.

4158,808432078.xml,"      DUBLIN -- As fears about Ireland's political stability rattled Europe on Tuesday, the party of Prime Minister Brian Cowen brushed aside calls for his immediate ouster on Tuesday and urged the government to approve wrenching budget- and deficit-reduction plans in order to secure a $100 billion bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.   Shaken by the prospect of political chaos at a critical juncture for the nation, politicians acknowledged the need to put the good of the country ahead of backroom politics and quickly push through a crucial 2011 budget. The alternative of a splintered government that might backtrack on deficit-cutting measures worried European officials and raised new uncertainty in financial markets, which fell across Europe on Tuesday.   ""There is enormous significance to passing the budget,"" said Michael Kennedy, a senior official in the governing Fianna Fail party, after Mr. Cowen emerged unscathed from a parliamentary meeting Tuesday evening. After the budget is passed in December, Mr. Kennedy said, he expected the party to have Mr. Cowen ""stand aside and a new leader come forward.""   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned that the euro currency union was in an ""extraordinarily serious situation"" because of Ireland's problems.   Olli Rehn, the European Union's monetary and financial affairs commissioner, cautioned that further political infighting and a failure to pass the 2011 budget would ""increase uncertainty"" about a rescue package, and threatened to reignite financial volatility in Europe's other crisis-stricken economies, including Spain, Greece and Portugal.   Earlier in the day, backbench members of Mr. Cowen's Fianna Fail party, battered and demoralized by pressure from European leaders to accept substantial financial aid, said they would push for a no-confidence motion. One party member, Noel O'Flynn, vowed that the parliamentary meeting over Mr. Cowen's fate would be a ""bare-knuckle affair.""   Sinn Fein, a minority party, also urged Ireland's lawmakers to oust the prime minister, saying he had betrayed Ireland by mismanaging the economy and effectively handing the nation's sovereignty over to European leaders and the monetary fund.   But Mr. Cowen dug in Tuesday, urging lawmakers to back a separate four-year plan scheduled to be presented Wednesday that would find $20 billion in savings to cut the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014 from 32 percent now. About $8 billion in cuts would be front-loaded in the 2011 budget.   Fianna Fail's opponents, likely to become the new governing majority after elections, had appeared to waver on whether to approve the 2011 budget, which has to be completed by Dec. 7. It calls for additional cuts that would affect the working poor, including minimum wage and welfare payment reductions.   Leaders across Ireland's political spectrum do agree on one thing: keeping Ireland's ultralow 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, which has lured businesses like Microsoft, Intel and Facebook here and fueled a surge in exports. Tax policies are considered a sovereign decision, but in the first sign that anything could be on the table to pay Ireland's huge bills, a top German adviser on Monday said Ireland would eventually have ""no alternative"" but to revisit the corporate tax rate.   Comments like these have fanned a mix of anger and humiliation through Ireland's airwaves and onto the front pages here, along with a sense that influential decision makers in Europe and Washington are eclipsing Ireland's sovereignty and will effectively dictate how the economy is run over the near-term.   ""There is no doubt that there will be an erosion in sovereignty,"" said John Gormley, the leader of the Green Party, which quit the government coalition on Monday, after Mr. Cowen accepted the European Union package. ""It's just a question of how big it will be.""      ",2010-11-24
3245,919630826.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED HONG KONG -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said Thursday that China would consider working with the International Monetary Fund to help shore up Europe's finances. But he left unclear whether China was willing to drop conditions that so far have made its proposed help unappealing to European nations.   Mr. Wen's comments came at a Beijing news conference after he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on the first day of her three-day visit to China.   Mrs. Merkel is the first of several European leaders scheduled to visit China this month, as China's huge holdings of foreign exchange reserves have begun to give it financial influence that could potentially rival Washington's.   Mr. Wen said that Chinese officials were studying whether the country should be ""involving itself more"" in helping Europe solve its debt troubles by investing in the region's two big rescue packages: the existing European Financial Stability Facility and the planned European Stability Mechanism. China's contributions could be channeled through the I.M.F., he said.   Lending money to the I.M.F. to, in turn, relend to Europe would effectively transfer more of the risk of any European debt default to the I.M.F. China has previously made clear that it would need to buffer the risk of lending more money to Europe.    In December, Russia embraced the lending approach now being weighed by China, but Moscow was willing to lend the I.M.F. only $20 billion. Europe is trying to expand its bailout funds by hundreds of billions of dollars.    Britain has also said it would consider sending more money to the I.M.F. to help with Europe's troubles -- but only after the Europeans demonstrated they were finally taking bold steps to stem the contagion.   China had $3.18 trillion in foreign exchange reserves at the end of December, dwarfing the reserves of every other country and potentially giving it the financial firepower to make a significant contribution.   Having Chinese money on the table could help restore the international investing community's confidence in Europe. It would also signal that the Chinese believe Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders have taken the necessary steps to begin solving Europe's sovereign debt crisis.    One big question, though, is what kind of political or trade concessions China might want in exchange for assistance.   When Mr. Wen suggested last September that the European Union could dismantle its legal protections against low-price Chinese exports, the idea was immediately condemned by European trade officials.   An opinion article Thursday in the official China Daily newspaper raised Mr. Wen's trade condition again and suggested that the European Union should also make political concessions -- like lifting a longstanding ban on arms exports to China. ""As a Chinese saying goes, one does not visit the temple for nothing,"" the column warned.   Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.'s managing director, has been playing a prominent role in trying to broker an agreement that will satisfy creditor nations like Germany and debtor nations like Greece at the same time. That includes a possible plan to convert the temporary, 440-billion euro ($577 billion) European Financial Stability Facility into a permanent, 500-billion euro ($655 billion) European Stability Mechanism.    European officials have been approaching China intermittently for two years. The aim is to persuade the Chinese government to increase the approximately one-quarter of its foreign exchange reserves that are thought to be held now in euros, mostly in government bonds issued by the financially strongest countries in Europe -- and to get Beijing to diversify that lending by buying the bonds of other, more troubled nations in the euro currency union.    Economists and officials with a detailed knowledge of China's position have said repeatedly that China would be willing to help, but only if its loans could be made essentially risk-free. One way to do this would be for the European nations jointly to agree to repay the loans even if some nations defaulted. But Germany has been wary of any arrangement that could make it the guarantor of other European nations' liabilities, and there has been little sign that German thinking on this has changed.   Another way to address China's concerns about risk would be for the I.M.F. to assume the liability.   Chinese officials indicated in November and early December that they were leery of helping Europe, noting publicly that the country's foreign exchange reserves had been financed with money borrowed from the Chinese people. Beijing suggested that it might be safer to invest it in infrastructure projects overseas instead of government bonds.   But since then, the sense of crisis in Europe has diminished somewhat. That is largely because the European Central Bank in mid-December began extending large three-year loans to European commercial banks at extremely low interest rates, damping concerns of a Lehman Brothers-style liquidity crisis breaking out.    Europe's troubles are far from over, however. The euro region's economy is expected to languish in recession for most of this year. Greece has also been struggling to raise the money for bond payments due next month in order to avoid a default. So the financial negotiations to stabilize Europe remain urgent.   A clear priority for Beijing has been to prevent a slump in the value of the euro against China's currency, the renminbi. Such a slump, by increasing the renminbi's relative value, would make Chinese goods less competitive in Europe, China's largest export market.    ""China supports Europe in safeguarding the stability of the euro,"" Mr. Wen said at the news conference, alongside Mrs. Merkel.   Germany has joined the United States in the past in supporting a stronger renminbi. But Mrs. Merkel was circumspect on the subject Thursday, saying only that she supported the Chinese goal of working together to make the renminbi more convertible on global currency markets.

2504,1847540056.xml,"       BERLIN -- When a 19-year-old medical student was found raped and drowned in the university city of Freiburg in October, it was seen as a sad and awful crime, but a local one. Beyond a few tabloids, the story failed to make national headlines. But when the Freiburg police announced last Saturday that they had arrested an Afghan refugee for the crime, reaction was swift and bitter. The Facebook page of Freiburg's local newspaper was flooded with comments about ""Rapefugees,"" suggesting that ""such cases require special SHOWERS to be set up again."" Some national news organizations picked up the news of the arrest of the suspect, an Afghan teenager who arrived in Germany last year without his family. The mass-circulation Bild newspaper ran it under the headline ""How Do We Handle This Truth?"" But only after Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of her cabinet weighed in on the fierce debate over that question did the country's leading public broadcaster, ARD, pick up the story, which it had originally judged did not meet the threshold for national news. Over the past week, citizens, politicians and journalists have wrestled with the reality that to the German public, it seems that a crime committed by a migrant is of national interest and importance, while a similar one committed by a German is, perhaps, not. ARD's earlier decision not to report on the crime set off further anger and accusations that the country's ""liberal media elite"" were intent on protecting migrants, going so far as to underreport or even cover up their crimes. The differing views have revealed deep rifts in German society between those who support Ms. Merkel's decision to welcome some one million migrants and those who view the newcomers, who are mostly Muslim, as a threat to the country's stability and security. Typing the German words ""are migrants"" into Google's search engine in Germany completes the phrase with ""more criminal than Germans"" on its second suggestion. In an attempt to calm a heated debate and answer just that question, Germany's Federal Criminal Office, or BKA, released statistics in June about migrant criminality last year. Less than 10 percent of Germany's population of 81 million people is foreign born. Of the roughly two million people investigated for all crimes, just 6 percent were migrants. Of 2,721 crimes that ended in a death, migrants were responsible for 233, or about 9 percent. And of 1,683 cases of sexual abuse, including rape, migrants were responsible for about 5 percent. All of those percentages were at least double the previous year's, but the BKA report noted that the migrant population had increased by 357 percent. In short, it was not a particularly damning portrait. ""It is not about the facts, it is not about the women, it is not about the victim, it is not even really about the perpetrator. It is about fear,"" wrote Jakob Augstein, a Der Spiegel columnist, in an editorial. ""And the essence of fear is that which is feared becomes reality."" After members of Ms. Merkel's cabinet and other leading politicians from across the spectrum joined the debate, Kai Gniffke, ARD's editor in chief, defended the station's decision in a blog post. After careful consideration, he said, editors did not consider the crime in Freiburg to be any different from the roughly 300 other murders that take place in Germany each year. But as the crime, and the station's handling of it, became the center of a stormy national debate, ARD changed its mind, even inviting Ms. Merkel on the evening news program to comment. ""If it should emerge that it was an Afghan refugee, then that must be condemned, as would be with every other murder,"" the chancellor told ARD. But she warned against condemning or targeting all refugees, stressing that ""the case remains a tragic event that must be cleared up, and must be openly discussed."" Ms. Merkel's measured comments, made just a day before she called for banning full-face veils ""wherever legally possible,"" were indicative of the political balancing act she is now undertaking. On the one hand, she has repeatedly underscored the Western liberal values that underpinned her decision to embrace the migrants. She has also consistently defended that decision with a ""We can do this"" slogan intended to minimize the logistical and security challenges she may have invited. But as pressure has grown from the far right and Germans have grown more wary after prominent episodes, including widespread sexual harassment blamed on migrants in Cologne last New Year's Eve and terrorist attacks this summer, the chancellor has also made clear that Germany would be less welcoming in the future. Her conservative Christian Democrats have begun taking a harder line, passing a resolution at their party congress this week aimed at toughening penalties for forced marriage and honor killings and urging an end to dual citizenship. The far right has been quick to seize on crimes like the murder in Freiburg of Maria Ladenburger, whose body was spotted in the Dreisam River by a jogger on Oct. 17, the morning after she was killed. The police say they identified the suspect -- a 17-year-old whose name they gave only as Hussein K., in keeping with German privacy law -- through DNA evidence from a strand of hair found near the crime scene. In the aftermath, Hans Peter Stauch, a member of the legislature in the state, Baden-Württemberg, for the rightest-populist Alternative for Germany party, warned of future dangers. ""The refugees that have come to us are certainly not per se to be marked as bad or criminal,"" he wrote in a letter to a local newspaper, The Reutlinger Wochenblatt. ""But it would be and is naïve, if not outright careless, to declare that through such uncontrolled immigration 'only' the peaceful and good people have come here. ""It is equally naïve and careless to believe that especially the young men, who have been socialized in an archaic value system from the Middle Ages, will be magically transformed into enlightened, socially acceptable democrats after they cross our borders,"" he added. Such feelings have made editorial decisions especially wrenching for the country's two main broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, which are funded by a public that increasingly wants a say in how its money is spent. ""The public broadcasters, even more than commercial media outlets, must become transparent about their processes and how they make decisions,"" said Leonard Novy, a political scientist at the Institute for Media and Communication Policy in Cologne. ""Whether these institutions are able to survive in the future depends on this, because they are not simply accepted today as they were in the past,"" he added. The struggle to put the crime in its place was not limited to the broadcasters, however. Many traditional news media also questioned whether it should be treated as the terrible act of one individual, or said anything larger about clashes of culture and the integration of refugees in Germany society. ""A terrible crime happened in Freiburg,"" Reinhard Müller wrote in an editorial critical of ARD's decision in the conservative newspaper, The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which began covering the murder in November, after it was broadcast on a national television show about unsolved crimes. ""It is of course debatable how these incidents should be covered. But is it really acceptable not to cover a crime because it has possibly been perpetrated by a young asylum seeker?"" Mr. Müller wrote. ""That would mean that the German media are saying that they are not interested in stories that the German public is,"" he wrote. ""That is a slippery slope.""

1077,1706966615.xml,"       BERLIN --  Three thousand migrants a day will pour into the Balkans trying to reach Western Europe in the next few months, the United Nations forecast on Tuesday, a few hours after a suspected arson attack destroyed a sports hall in Germany where some migrants were to be sheltered. The German police said they believed the fire in Nauen, about 25 miles west of Berlin, had been deliberately set, the latest of more than 200 attacks directed against migrants in the country this year. It was spotted just after 2 a.m. and swiftly destroyed the sports hall, which had been prepared to serve as temporary housing for about 100 migrants, the authorities said. No one was injured in the fire. Officials throughout the country have scrambled to find or adapt decent places to shelter new arrivals in Germany, where the struggle to stop anti-immigrant violence has vied for headlines with a mass migration not seen in Europe since the wars that ripped apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The United Nations refugee agency said it expected about 3,000 people to cross into Macedonia every day from Greece, the first European Union nation they reach in their flight from conflict and deprivation in the Middle East and beyond. ""We do not see any end to the influx of people in coming months,"" Melissa Fleming, chief spokeswoman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said on Tuesday in Geneva. She cited continued violence in Syria and Iraq and deteriorating conditions for refugees in overcrowded camps and homes in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Ms. Fleming said that Germany and Sweden had taken in 43 percent of the asylum seekers in the 28-nation European Union, and she suggested that the burden should be divided more evenly. ""We honestly believe if correct measures are taken, this is something that Europe can handle,"" Ms. Fleming said, according to Reuters. ""It's a bigger number than last year, yes. But it's not going to turn Europe upside down."" Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who on Monday denounced neo-Nazi riots near Dresden late last week as ""repugnant,"" said she would visit Heidenau, the site of those disturbances, on Wednesday, a day before she attends a conference in Vienna to discuss stanching the flow of arrivals from the Balkans. Ms. Merkel's visit to Heidenau will be her first to a refugee facility since the crisis intensified in recent weeks, when many migrants started moving north from Turkey, through Greece and the Balkans, to Hungary and beyond. On Tuesday, a day after she joined France in urging more European action, Ms. Merkel reiterated that Germany and a handful of other countries needed help in tackling the problem. ""Three or four out of 28 cannot bear the whole burden,"" the chancellor told a crowd in Duisburg, a city in the German state with the most refugees, North Rhine-Westphalia. Germany, Sweden, Austria and France have led the way in sheltering new arrivals, according to European officials. The vice chancellor of Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats and minister for the country's booming economy, visited Heidenau on Monday, diverting from a planned tour of ""Silicon Saxony,"" the technology start-up scene around Dresden. An amateur video posted on the website of the weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday showed battles between right-wing protesters, some of them masked, and the police in Heidenau. The clashes over the weekend left at least 31 wounded. German news media have reported that hundreds of people turned out for a demonstration Friday evening organized by the far right National Democratic Party in Heidenau, which like Nauen has a population of about 16,000. Some of those demonstrators then battled the police. On Saturday evening, anti-immigrant protesters and a group welcoming the new arrivals were both on the streets of Heidenau as police officers escorted four busloads of migrants to the converted building where they are now housed. Bottles and stones were thrown at the buses and at the police. ""It is repugnant how right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis are trying to spread their dumb message of hate around a facility for refugees,"" Ms. Merkel said on Monday. She particularly condemned those who just watched, some of whom even took children along. German leaders have so far failed to halt the attacks on arriving foreigners. After returning from vacation and trying to settle the financial crisis over Greece, Ms. Merkel predicted that the new wave of migration would command the attention of European leaders for even longer than the past months of negotiations over a new bailout for the government in Athens. Since then, barely a day has passed without fresh accounts of migrants moving north, or of facilities for them coming under attack. A refugee shelter burned Sunday night in the western German state of Baden-Württemberg. So far, no injuries have been reported in the attacks, which totaled 202 in the first six months of this year, compared to 198 in all of 2014.

3976,2023610102.xml,"FRANKFURT -- Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias Müller, as it grapples with a diesel emissions scandal that has cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and scarred the German carmaker's reputation.Herbert Diess, who is in charge of the company's flagship Volkswagen brand, was likely to succeed Mr. Müller, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was considering a leadership change, and a final decision was expected by the end of the week.While there was no obvious trigger for Mr. Müller's departure at this moment, his efforts to lead the company beyond the 2015 emissions cheating scandal have stalled.The repercussions have continued to multiply, tainting not only Volkswagen but also its rivals BMW and Daimler just as they grapple with an industrywide shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Political leaders are pressing the German carmakers to compensate diesel owners who bought cars that turned out to be dirtier than advertised, which could add to the already astronomical cost of the scandal.Word of Mr. Müller's expected departure came only days after Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, fired its chief executive, John Cryan, amid chronic losses. The boardroom turmoil at two of the country's most prominent companies is symptomatic of the clouds that are beginning to gather around the German economy. While unemployment is at record lows, other recent indicators have pointed to slower growth, including falling industrial production.Mr. Müller, 64, took over Volkswagen amid the worst crisis in its postwar history, days after it admitted in September 2015 that it had cheated on diesel emissions tests, installing illegal software in 11 million vehicles.He succeeded in preventing a collapse of sales and profits. But Mr. Müller, who has spent his entire career at Volkswagen or its subsidiaries, struggled to deliver on his promise to remake the company's insular culture. The carmaker has continued to suffer blows to its reputation, including revelations in January that it had financed tests on monkeys in a bungled attempt to show that diesel exhaust was not as dangerous as it once was.Mr. Diess, 59, carries less baggage than Mr. Müller because he arrived at Volkswagen only a few months before the diesel deceit erupted. And Mr. Diess has led Volkswagen's push to mass produce electric cars, which are seen as essential to the company's ability to defend itself against challengers like Tesla, Uber and Google that are trying to upend the auto industry.""This is a chance for Volkswagen to make a change,"" said Christian Strenger, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank's wealth management division, who is suing Volkswagen because he said it violated its duty to shareholders by failing to be forthcoming about the emissions scandal. But Mr. Strenger said that Mr. Diess would have to ""have the guts to clean things up.""Volkswagen is still the target of a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has included searches of Mr. Müller's offices. However, there has been no new information that would have prompted Mr. Müller to leave now, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors in Braunschweig who are conducting the inquiry.German prosecutors have not charged anyone in the Volkswagen case, but they expect to complete their investigation this year. Two former Volkswagen executives, James Liang and Oliver Schmidt, are serving prison sentences in the United States after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act.Mr. Müller was a high-ranking executive involved in product development at the same time that the company was developing the illegal software and deploying it in vehicles. He also worked closely with some of the people under investigation over possible involvement in the emissions scandal. Mr. Müller has insisted he was ignorant of any wrongdoing, but he has nonetheless faced the accusation that he was part of a system that allowed it to take place.In a statement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it was considering ""a further development of the management structure of the group,"" which could ""include a change in the position of the chairman of the board of management,"" referring to Mr. Müller. The company said it had not yet made a decision on him, but merely calling his status into question effectively sealed his fate.Mr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company's longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company's Audi and Porsche luxury brands.Mr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. Müller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.But he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen's powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.And Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. Pötsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen's shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.The challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable. Even now, the diesel scandal continues to corrode Volkswagen's reputation.In January, The New York Times reported that the company had helped to finance experiments in which monkeys were forced to breathe diesel fumes at a lab in Albuquerque. The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg.Volkswagen's cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen's deception was uncovered.The scandal exposed the degree to which virtually all of the European carmakers took advantage of regulatory loopholes to sell diesels that polluted far more in everyday use than in official tests, causing poor air quality that led to thousands of premature deaths. As a result, cities across Europe have taken steps to restrict the use of diesel vehicles in urban centers. German carmakers have suffered the most from the backlash because of their dependence on the technology.Volkswagen's stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. Müller's upcoming departure.Credit: JACK EWING; Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Follow Jack Ewing on Twitter: @JackEwingNYT.Matthias Müller struggled to remake Volkswagen's insular culture.

1281,1449885802.xml,"       BERLIN --  Just as European and American negotiators resumed work on a groundbreaking trade accord meant to tie their two continents closer together, René Obermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications giant, told a cybersecurity conference in Germany on Monday that his company was working to keep electronic message traffic from ""unnecessarily"" crossing the Atlantic, where it could fall into the hands of the National Security Agency.  Other German executives, and some politicians, are beginning to talk of segmenting the Internet, so that they are not reliant on large American firms that by contract or court order allow United States intelligence agencies to delve into their data about phone and Internet usage. Europeans are demanding that any new trade accord include data-privacy protections that the United States is eager to avoid. Almost never before has a spying scandal -- in this case the revelation of the monitoring of the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- resulted in such a concrete, commercial backlash. Now it is also driving a debate inside the American government about whether the United States, which has long spied on allies even while nurturing them as partners, may have to change its approach. ""What's more important?"" Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the N.S.A., asked during an interview last month, before the Merkel revelations. ""Partnering with countries may be more important than collecting on them,"" he said, especially when it comes to protecting against cyberthreats to the computer networks of the world's largest economies.  So far the Obama administration has refused to talk publicly about that choice, other than to provide Germany with assurances that now, and in the future, Ms. Merkel's cellphone conversations will be safe. In the past two weeks, two pairs of senior German officials have visited Washington trying to negotiate a new accord on intelligence sharing that would set ground rules as their government faces its own choice between gently pushing back a protector that has patently played a double game for years, or asserting its power in ways unknown since 1945. John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany, said he ""simply cannot imagine"" how the United States could target Germans that way ""and not end up with egg all over their face.""  ""It was unbelievably stupid, for no gain,"" he said.  Over the weekend Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel that ""there should be a wholesale housecleaning"" of the American intelligence community, and, echoing Mr. Kornblum, said that General Alexander ""should resign, or be fired.""  The White House has backed General Alexander, who is scheduled to retire early next year, but even some of President Obama's advisers have begun questioning the judgment of the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., who is supposed to review the costs and benefits of these operations, and some officials, saying they are speaking for themselves, have suggested he should leave around the time General Alexander does. ""The only way the president is going to get a fresh start with the allies,"" one of his advisers said last week, ""is to present them with a new team.""  Germany is now toughening its demands that the United States respect all domestic and international laws -- code words for ceasing the surveillance on German soil amid rising anger at the United States. Veteran observers of relations between the two nations suspect that over time the anger will abate, as it has in past spy scandals. But that may not prove to be as easy as the officials hope. Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who worked on European security issues for Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush, noted recently ""the broad drifting away"" between Europe and the United States. For its part, Germany has amassed a different kind of power as Europe's foremost economy. And, as Berlin's bridling at United States Treasury criticism of its economic policy showed last week, the country is resolute in defending its financial moves.  In addition to power shifts that require adjustments by both countries, each is experiencing a febrile moment politically and governmentally. The United States appears paralyzed in many ways, while in Germany, the conservative Ms. Merkel is negotiating a new government with the center-left Social Democrats. The attempt to rein in American activity is turning out to be harder than German officials hoped. The early talk that Germany would get the status accorded to Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- just about full sharing of data, and no-spy agreements -- has given way to a much more hardheaded discussion. Even German officials concede that a full-fledged accord is unlikely -- in part because it would require congressional approval -- and that negotiations are more likely to yield a memorandum of understanding. The United States has issued no public exemption from listening in on those in the German political, diplomatic or intelligence hierarchies other than Ms. Merkel. ""The reluctance is that you never know what you may need, in a month, or a year, or 10 years,"" one American intelligence official said.  Credit: ALISON SMALE and DAVID E.

1970,433581892.xml,"      For those trying to predict how France's newly elected president, Nicolas Sarkozy, will lead his country's economy, one of the first critical tests is likely to come here, at the home base of Airbus, the proud but ailing European plane maker. Still reeling from costly delays in its flagship A380 plane, Airbus has embarked on a wrenching overhaul that could result in thousands of lost jobs and the sale of several factories. The turmoil is aggravating political tensions between the company's French and German backers. How Mr. Sarkozy navigates these thorny issues may help clarify whether he is, at heart, a free-market reformer or an economic nationalist determined to prop up France's industrial patrimony. Given his track record and the imperatives of French politics, several experts said, he is probably a bit of both. Mr. Sarkozy, they predicted, will give Airbus leeway to proceed with cost-cutting, while at the same time moving to strengthen France's influence over the enterprise. He has already called for changes in the carefully calibrated, but increasingly unstable, shareholder structure that governs Airbus's parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS. That could raise hackles in Germany, which has long chafed at France's covetous attitude toward Airbus. Mr. Sarkozy pledged to cooperate with his conservative counterpart, Chancellor Angela Merkel, and she reciprocated this week with warm words about closer ties. Still, as Louis Gallois, the French chief executive of Airbus, noted wryly in a session with reporters here, ''He is kissing Angela Merkel when they meet, but that doesn't mean anything.'' For Mr. Gallois, a seasoned executive with ties to the Socialist Party, the election of Mr. Sarkozy injects another volatile element into what is already one of the hardest repair jobs in European industry. Economists have struggled to map out a Sarkozy presidency, partly because of his mixed message: Mr. Sarkozy wants to shake loose some pillars of France's state-directed economy, like the 35-hour workweek, while shoring up others, like so-called national champion companies. On the question of how to handle Airbus, he was more circumspect during the campaign than his Socialist rival, Segolene Royal. He did not urge a halt to the cost-cutting plan, as she did. That gives some analysts hope that Mr. Sarkozy will not interfere with the Airbus overhaul. Job cuts at Airbus, in fact, could give Mr. Sarkozy a chance to deliver on his campaign promises of better job placement services and more generous unemployment benefits. ''Airbus could soon become a test of his plans for a more flexible labor market,'' said Nicolas Sobczak, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Paris. ''It would be a good showcase to demonstrate to the unions that it's not useful to oppose a business plan that makes sense.'' Sticking to that, however, would require considerable political nerve. Workers at Airbus plants have already staged strikes to protest the plan, which will eliminate 10,000 jobs, 4,300 of them in France. Mr. Sarkozy met with union leaders during the campaign and pledged that ''we shouldn't let Airbus down.'' As finance minister, he noted, he engineered the state-led bailout of the limping French industrial giant Alstom -- a move that did little for his reformist credentials. Already, there is evidence that France is trying to soften the blow of the cuts at Airbus. The French state, which owns 15 percent of EADS, and the Lagardere Group, which owns 7.5 percent, agreed to forgo their share of dividends from EADS. Mr. Gallois said the French were considering giving back some or all of that money -- 30 million euros ($41 million) -- to Airbus workers in France to compensate them for the loss of bonuses. Airbus plans to present details of its reorganization plan in early June and will then set about negotiating the details of job cuts with its unions. That will be a dangerous period, analysts said, since a season of labor unrest may spoil Mr. Sarkozy's honeymoon in Elysee Palace. Renegotiating the shareholding structure of Airbus and EADS may prove no less fraught with risk. France and Germany each control 22.5 percent of the voting shares of EADS. Germany exercises its vote through DaimlerChrysler and a consortium of public and private investors. The two countries balance their management influence over EADS through a balky dual-headed structure that neither side particularly likes. In addition to running Airbus, Mr. Gallois is the co-chief executive of EADS -- a post he shares with Thomas Enders, a German. Mr. Sarkozy has suggested bringing new shareholders into EADS if Lagardere or DaimlerChrysler were to trim their stakes further. After initially saying that Airbus's management should be left to work out their problems, he raised the possibility of the state taking a bigger role. ''Sarkozy, despite his pro-American attitude, still feels that Airbus is French and needs to be protected,'' said Doug McVitie, the managing director of Arran Aerospace, a consulting firm in Dinan, France. ''He has this French attitude that Airbus is strategic for France, in the same way that Danone was strategic for France in the yogurt business,'' Mr. McVitie said, referring to the French dairy brand that raised jitters here after becoming the target of a rumored takeover by PepsiCo. The potential for conflict between France and Germany has increased along with the magnitude of the woes at Airbus, he said. While the French shareholders of EADS were ready to cancel its dividend as a gesture to workers facing layoffs, DaimlerChrysler insisted on its payment. For his part, Mr. Gallois said little about Mr. Sarkozy's role, though he noted that breaking down the political and cultural barriers between France and Germany was critical to putting Airbus back on track. ''It's because of national pride that we have the problem of the A380, and people know that,'' he said.

2035,2217220044.xml,"Ask a member of Sri Lanka's dominant ethnic group why the country seems plagued by racial and religious strife, which is resurging in the wake of terrifying Islamist terrorist attacks, and you will often get the same answer.We are fighting for our very survival, they'll say. Though the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist, make up three-quarters of the population and dominate politics, many see themselves as an embattled minority.""They're trying to destroy us -- please tell someone in the government to take action,"" Nelligala Dhammaratne, an influential young monk, recalled his Buddhist followers telling him just before riots broke out against the country's Muslim minority last year.Such fears are not unique to Sri Lanka. Around the world, dominant majorities increasingly see themselves as imperiled minorities.That dynamic, sometimes known as a majority with a minority complex, is thought to be a major factor in the rise of right-wing populism in Europe, religious nationalism in Asia, and white nationalist terrorism in the United States and New Zealand.The drivers of this trend are often subtler than Sri Lanka's history of civil war, but can be just as consequential. Demographic change, global interconnectedness and even the rise of democracy can make majorities feel as if their dominance is endangered, leading to fear of -- and sometimes attacks on -- minorities whose very existence is perceived as an existential threat.A Cycle of ConflictThere is a classic, cautionary case: Northern Ireland.When communal tensions broke out into the outright fighting known as the Troubles in the late 1960s, Northern Ireland's Protestants were numerically, politically and economically dominant. But they were a minority on the island as a whole, feeding a sense of demographic peril.""The basic fear of Protestants in Northern Ireland is that they will be outbred by Roman Catholics,"" Terence O'Neill, Northern Ireland's prime minister, said at the conflict's outbreak. ""It is as simple as that.""Others said the Catholics were part of an international plot orchestrated from the Vatican.Sri Lanka's dynamics bear striking similarities. During its civil war, fought against separatists from the Tamil minority, Sinhalese felt outnumbered because of the large Tamil community in nearby India. This gave many Sinhalese a sense of siege, deepening us-versus-them divides that have outlasted the fighting.More recently, Sinhalese Buddhists have seen Sri Lanka's Muslim minority as vanguards of a global Muslim horde. Last year, Sinhalese fears that Muslims were seeking to outbreed and replace them culminated in riots.Conspiracies about foreign influence or minority birthrates are often driven by fears of a much more real change: a loss of status. Modern democracy demands that minorities be granted equal rights and opportunities, which can feel like a threat to majorities' traditional hold on power.Fears of existential, sectarian conflict can be self-realizing.In 1960s Northern Ireland, Catholic civil rights marches, modeled on those of the United States, felt to some Protestants like part of a wider Catholic plot to overrun them.Hard-line Protestants, acting in what they saw as self-defense, whipped up violent counter-protests, culminating in riots on both sides. In response, more Catholics joined violent republican factions, seemingly validating Protestants' worst fears. The tit-for-tat cycle continued for decades.Long after the peace process, and with Catholics and Protestants now near evenly numbered, a shared perception of being the aggrieved, vulnerable minority persists. So does the cycle of violence.Earlier this month, the journalist Lyra McKee was killed when a member of the New Irish Republican Army fired on the police. The group issued an apology, calling it a mistake.A Closer, More Competitive WorldThese dynamics are rising globally, and not only when one group is a majority nationally and a minority regionally.Asked in 2013 about Buddhist violence against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority that would later culminate in genocide, Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's de facto leader, responded by warning darkly of ""global Muslim power.""""The fear is not just on the side of the Muslims, it's on the side of the Buddhists as well,"" she said.Technological change may also play a role in these fears, which are driving a rise in religious nationalism across Asia. The world is more interconnected than it once was, and so feels a lot smaller. Word of any sectarian violence, no matter how far away, spreads rapidly on social media, feeding into perceptions of being threatened and outnumbered.And the rise of democracy, long considered a force for ethnic harmony, may be provoking majority backlashes instead, according to research by Jack Snyder, a Columbia University political scientist.As democracy became the global norm, dominant ethnic groups found themselves under growing pressure to share power with minorities. They even lost the occasional election.Anxiety around losing status can manifest as fears, however unfounded, of becoming outnumbered. In countries with weak institutions, that can lead to violence, possibly contributing to the stall in democracy's once-rapid spread.""We often see this phenomenon at moments of increasing democratization and increasing enfranchisement,"" said Kate Cronin-Furman, a University College London political scientist, citing ""horrible violence against the Rohingya breaking out at a time of increased democratization in Burma.""White BacklashAmong supporters of Europe's right-wing populist parties, it is common to hear fears uncannily similar to those expressed by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese.Muslims, we hear at rallies for the Alternative for Germany and France's National Front, will soon outnumber non-Muslims in Europe and impose Shariah law.A leader of Vox, the Spanish far-right party that just won its first Parliamentary seats, warned at a September rally of an ""Islamist invasion."" The party supports policies to increase Spanish birthrates.Many whites welcome pluralism and multiculturalism. But for those who see the decline of white dominance as destabilizing, any increase in the minority population is perceived as an attack.A growing body of research suggests that this sentiment may be driving significant political change in the United States, which is projected to become ""majority minority"" -- with whites less than half of the population -- by 2050.A study by Maureen Craig of New York University and Jennifer Richeson of Yale University found that white Americans who so much as read a news article on these demographic changes will express ""more negative attitudes toward Latinos, blacks, and Asian-Americans"" and ""more automatic pro-white/anti-minority bias.""The effect disappeared when the authors told participants that whites were expected to remain politically and culturally dominant.Other studies find that when white Americans learn about these demographic trends they become less supportive of immigration, affirmative action, welfare spending and health care spending, and more supportive of military spending and of President Trump.In a 2016 poll, 57 percent of whites said ""discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.""Fears of 'Replacement'Whites are subject to the same forces as any other demographic group. Fears of being outnumbered can lead to violence.A rising wave of white-nationalist terrorists repeatedly cite ""replacement theory,"" in which Jews are said to be orchestrating mass immigration in order to destroy the white race.At the 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, white power activists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"" during their torchlit march on the University of Virginia campus.Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 50 people in two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques, described immigration and low white birthrates as ""an assault on the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people.""Last week, a gunman opened fire in a synagogue in Poway, Calif. A document attributed to the shooter echoed the same fear: demographic replacement.The Interpreter is a column by Max Fisher and Amanda Taub exploring the ideas and context behind major world events.

935,433613744.xml,"      President Bush delivered a two-pronged message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday, two days before their scheduled meeting in Germany, chiding Mr. Putin for derailing democratic reforms while assuring the Russian leader that he had nothing to fear from a missile defense system in Europe. Mr. Bush issued the human rights rebuke on the first day of an eight-day swing through Europe, in a venue laden with symbolism: a conference on democracy co-led by the former Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky. Democracy advocates and dissidents from 17 countries had gathered in Czernin Palace, in the very room where the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was dissolved, to hear Mr. Bush speak. After a lengthy discourse on freedom as a ''moral imperative,'' in which he chronicled human rights abuses around the globe, from Myanmar to North Korea to Sudan, Mr. Bush turned his attention to Russia and China, linking them as countries whose relationships with the United States, he said, were strong, but also complex. ''China's leaders believe that they can continue to open the nation's economy without opening its political system; we disagree,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In Russia, reforms that were once promised to empower citizens have been derailed, with troubling implications for democratic development.'' It was a more negative assessment than Mr. Bush has made in the past, and in likening Russia to China Mr. Bush risked arousing Mr. Putin's ire. The comparison to China was ''a pretty significant step at the rhetorical level for the Bush administration,'' said Andrew Kuchins, the director of the Russia Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. That was especially the case because the criticism came out of the mouth of Mr. Bush, rather than another member of his administration. Last year, when Mr. Bush met with critics of the Kremlin, he told them that he had concerns about the state of democracy in Russia but would not lecture Mr. Putin about them publicly. Mr. Putin is already up in arms over the president's plan to build a network of radar and missile defenses in Poland and here in the Czech Republic, though Mr. Bush said Tuesday that Mr. Putin need not view the proposal as a threat. ''My message will be, Vladimir -- I call him Vladimir -- that you shouldn't fear a missile defense system,'' Mr. Bush said during a morning appearance with the leaders of the Czech Republic at Prague Castle, high on a hill overlooking the city. ''As a matter of fact, why don't you cooperate with us on a missile defense system? Why don't you participate with the United States?'' Reaction from the Kremlin was muted. Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Putin ''has always appreciated the openness of President Bush,'' though he added, ''Of course, we cannot agree with some of the things that were said.'' The back-to-back speeches were orchestrated by the White House with the intent of sending a measured, but firm, message to Mr. Putin when American-Russian relations are at their lowest point in years. Mr. Bush has often spoken of the need to promote democracy, and by sounding that theme before an especially receptive crowd, the speech also offered the president a rare escape from criticism over his policies in Iraq. ''The most powerful weapon in the struggle against extremism is not bullets or bombs -- it is the universal appeal of freedom,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking to an audience that included Vaclav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, and Cheol Hwan-kang, the author of ''The Aquariums of Pyongyang,'' an account of 10 years he had spent as a child in a North Korean concentration camp. ''Freedom is the design of our maker, and the longing of every soul,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''Freedom is the best way to unleash the creativity and economic potential of a nation. Freedom is the only ordering of a society that leads to justice. And human freedom is the only way to achieve human rights.'' In a sense, the speeches may have also been part of the White House strategy to have Mr. Bush clear the air with Mr. Putin in advance of Thursday's meeting between the two leaders at the gathering of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, in the Baltic seaside resort town of Heiligendamm, Germany. The two leaders are expected to confront disagreements over Kosovo, as well as human rights and missile defense, although they may find common ground over curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Mr. Bush has also invited Mr. Putin to the Bush family compound in Maine early next month -- an unusual effort by the White House to mend fences with the Russian leader. Kennebunkport is the home of Mr. Bush's parents, and no foreign leader has received an invitation to visit since Mr. Bush's father was in office. Mr. Bush's approach, however, drew criticism from two Russian opposition leaders: Andrei Illarianov, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington and Mr. Putin's former economics adviser; and Garry Kasparov, the onetime chess champion who heads the United Civil Front, a political party devoted to promoting democratic freedoms. Mr. Illarianov warned that the West ''does not have a widely accepted and effective strategy'' for dealing with Mr. Putin. Mr. Kasparov, who is widely regarded as a potential presidential candidate in Russia, warned ''If Bush hopes to gain anything by having private discussions with Putin, he's wrong. Putin thrives in an atmosphere of secrecy. He's a K.G.B. spy -- anything behind closed doors gives him an advantage.'' Mr. Kasparov said that he wished Mr. Bush would echo the much sharper criticism of Russia put forth by David Kramer, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Asian affairs, who delivered a blistering assessment of the Kremlin's human rights record in a speech last week in Baltimore. ''These are the things that must be pronounced by George W. Bush,'' Mr. Kasparov said. But the White House has said it wants to tamp down the vocal sparring between the nations. Mr. Putin has been jabbing at the Bush administration for weeks; he made a veiled comparison of the United States to the Third Reich, complained of ''diktat and imperialism,'' and warned he would have no choice but to point Russia's own missiles at Europe if the United States followed through with the missile defense system. The remarks, in an interview published Monday, instantly evoked memories of the cold war, and Mr. Putin did little to discourage that comparison, saying, ''We are, of course, returning to those times.'' But Mr. Bush, standing alongside President Vaclav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic, pointedly dismissed any talk of a return to those hair-trigger days. The Czech leaders both support the missile plan, and a vote in Parliament is expected this year. ''The cold war is over,'' the president declared. ''It ended. The people of the Czech Republic don't have to choose between being a friend of the United States and a friend of Russia. You can be both.'' Mr. Bush left Prague on Tuesday evening for Heiligendamm, where he is to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Wednesday to discuss the major agenda topic of the Group of 8 meeting: climate change. After the meeting, Mr. Bush plans a side trip to Poland -- a move that will effectively bookend Thursday's Bush-Putin meeting with presidential trips to both nations that figure into the missile defense plan.

3986,1917609494.xml,"HAMBURG, Germany -- Every Western democracy struggles with the contradictory demands of permitting free expression and maintaining public order. In Germany, the experience of Nazism and Communism highlights the clamor for free speech and how best to protect it.The violence that marred the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg last week clearly caught the authorities off guard, despite the deployment of more than 20,000 police officers called in from across Germany and its European neighbors. It has opened a searing if familiar debate about who was to blame for the loss of control in some areas where large groups of people expressed their anger at the global political and economic system.Leftists held the police responsible, not the peaceful protesters, and insisted that guaranteeing nonviolent demonstrations was a basic tenet of German democracy enshrined in the Basic Law, Germany's 1949 constitution, and upheld by important court rulings over the years.Equally predictably, conservatives blamed troublemakers for the clashes in Hamburg where they said well-organized vandals disguised themselves as ""clash tourists.""""These were not demonstrators, they were criminal chaos makers,"" who rampaged out of control, attacked property and people, looted and burned, the interior minister Thomas de Maizière said Monday. ""Chaos makers from Germany and Europe cannot lay claim to political motives,"" he said, adding that they are not the pacifists some on the left say they are.""They are contemptible, violent extremists, just like the neo-Nazis are, and the Islamic terrorists,"" he said, adding that anyone who hurls concrete sidewalk slabs at police officers could be accused of attempted murder.Before the G-20, hundreds of would-be protesters were turned back at Germany's borders under special controls imposed in recent weeks, Mr. de Maizière said. At least a few hundred demonstrators who did make it to Hamburg came from elsewhere in Europe and had smuggled equipment into Germany as early as two years ago. Their actions were ""organized, prepared and orchestrated,"" Mr. de Maizière said.Among the protesters themselves, there was recognition that no one sought violence, but, at the same time, veteran activists were aware that trouble could erupt. Hamburg has long been home to a firmly established community of some 8,000 leftists and anarchists.""Of course we hope the protest is peaceful,"" said Caral Gottas, a member of the Attac group that helped to organize the largest march last Saturday. ""It should be peaceful -- that's what they decided a few months ago.""What happened last night was not part of our plan,"" she said, referring to the violence and looting that took place last Friday night. ""It was irresponsible, stupid people doing this. We want to inform people about the topics and don't want to burn down our own city.""Most of the demonstrators over three days in Hamburg were indeed peaceful. Michael Ferck, who took his three children, ages 13, 11 and 9, to a small march on Saturday, said that he wanted them to learn how to make their voices heard.""This type of protest also shows the world that demonstrating peacefully is possible,"" Mr. Ferck said. ""It makes them think about what values to stand for.""Germany's courts have issued many rulings over the years regulating peaceful protests in ways that were never contained in the Basic Law, said Christian Pestalozza, a law professor at Berlin's Free University.The courts generally preserve the right to protest and often side with demonstrators' demands, he added. Protesters in Hamburg who demanded and eventually won from the court the right last week to camp in open spaces in the city -- and even to install bathrooms -- had no automatic constitutional right to do that.""Nothing of that is in the Basic Law,"" Professor Pestalozza said in a telephone interview. ""People in Hamburg who were not taking part in the protest had their daily lives affected by such camps but no say in whether they were permitted.""Since the violence, analysts and politicians have raced to offer alternative explanations. Some have suggested having all of the G-20 summits in New York, where the annual United Nations General Assembly meeting attracts world leaders each September, while others have recommended holding the G-20 in more isolated locations.Professor Pestalozza put forth another option: ""You don't move the event, but perhaps instead you move the protest,"" he said.Authorities said 476 police officers and an unknown number of protesters were injured during the violence in Hamburg. More than 400 people were either arrested or detained.By comparison, more than 1,000 demonstrators were held after huge protests in the German city of Rostock in 2007 during the Group of 8 summit held nearby on the Baltic Sea. Very few of those protesters who were detained served any kind of jail sentence, said Simon Teune, a researcher at Berlin's Technical University who studies protests.The interior minister, Mr. de Maizière, who is a Christian Democrat, and Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat mayor of Hamburg, have both called for the often lenient courts to issue tough sentences for anybody charged with offenses in Hamburg.And for once, the two mainstream parties of the center-right and center-left refrained from pointing fingers at each other, because each was involved in planning and hosting the Hamburg summit. (Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was born in Hamburg, is seeking a fourth term in the September elections, where polls currently show that she would beat the Social Democrats handily.)Commentators noted that the political miscalculations and the policing difficulties virtually canceled each other out in a series of events that authorities had not foreseen. Last week, Mr. Scholz had assured everyone that the Hamburg summit would go off smoothly, just like an earlier festival celebrating the city's history as a Hanseatic port.When protests grew out of control in Hamburg, it was a double disaster, wrote Heribert Prantl in the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. Though Ms. Merkel made meager gains for world unity in keeping the G-20 united on all issues except climate change, the authorities could not balance the right to free expression with the need for maintaining order.""The police have two duties in circumstances like these: They must prevent violence, and protect the basic right to demonstrate,"" Mr. Prantl wrote. ""In Hamburg at the G-20, they unfortunately failed at both.""ALISON SMALE   Follow Alison Smale on Twitter at asmalenyt.

831,1426709630.xml,"       LIMASSOL, Cyprus --  When European leaders engineered a harsh bailout deal for this tiny Mediterranean nation in March, they cheered the end of an economic model fueled by a flood of cash from Russia. Wealthy Russians with money in Cyprus's sickly banks lost billions. But the Russians, though badly bruised, are now in a position to get something that has previously eluded even Moscow's most audacious oligarchs: control of a so-called systemic financial institution in the European Union. ""They wanted to throw out the Russians but in the end, they delivered our main bank to the Russians,"" said the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, in a June interview. The March bailout hammered bank creditors and depositors in an early test of what has since become the official European Union policy of ""bailing-in"" banks. The policy is intended to force creditors and depositors to pay for a bank's mistakes and to spare taxpayers from picking up the entire bill. The strategy, however, has generated unintended consequences in the case of Cyprus. The exercise was meant to banish what Germany and other Northern European nations viewed as dirty Russian money from Cyprus's bloated banks. Instead, it has pulled Russia even deeper into Europe's financial system by giving its plutocrats majority ownership, at least on paper, of the Bank of Cyprus, the country's oldest, biggest and most important financial institution. ""Whoever controls the Bank of Cyprus controls the island,"" said Andreas Marangos, a Limassol lawyer whose clients include many Russians. The biggest single chunk of shares -- around 18 percent -- is supposed to go to depositors who lost money in Cyprus's now-defunct Laiki Bank, but this stake is likely to be controlled by Cyprus's central bank. As a result of a forced conversion of Bank of Cyprus deposits into shares, however, a diverse and so far unorganized group of depositors, most of them Russians, will end up with a controlling stake. Whether they want such a bank is another matter. Owning the Bank of Cyprus, which has been saddled with $11.7 billion in liabilities racked up by Laiki Bank, ""is like owning cancer,"" said Irakli Bukhashvili, the head of a financial services company serving Russians here in Limassol, the business capital of Cyprus. Despite its wobbly condition, the Bank of Cyprus still holds a uniquely influential position in the economic and political affairs of a sun-swept nation that sits on potentially large reserves of natural gas and straddles strategic fault lines between East and West. President Anastasiades, in a June letter to the European Central Bank that pleaded for help to keep the Bank of Cyprus afloat, described it as a ""mega-systemic bank"" that, if it failed, could bring down the entire Cypriot economy. With 5,700 employees and around half of all the island's deposits, it dwarfs its rivals and reaches into every corner of the country through a vast network of branches, which now also includes the former offices of Laiki Bank. Moscow, though furious over the billions lost by Russians in Cypriot banks, still sees Cyprus as a prize worth courting. The Russian government has pushed for access for its military aircraft to an air base in Paphos and for its warships to Cypriot ports. When Cyprus first appealed for help from the so-called troika of international creditors -- the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank -- the main problem was Laiki, the country's second-biggest bank and one that was already effectively insolvent. Instead of just throwing Cyprus a financial lifeline, as it had done with Ireland after a banking crisis that led the government to guarantee all the banks, the troika demanded that Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus share the burden of any rescue deal. Depositors with large accounts in Laiki Bank were initially left with just 100,000 euros each, about $130,000, and the rest of their money was confiscated as the bank shut down. Those with more than 100,000 euros in the Bank of Cyprus lost access to 90 percent of their cash, although they have since been promised future access to some of their frozen funds. But, under final terms announced on July 30 by the Central Bank of Cyprus, large depositors in the Bank of Cyprus will have 47.5 percent of their money forcibly converted into shares, up from 37.5 percent in an original plan. Hardly anyone has yet received their share certificates. But, according to the nation's finance minister, Harris Georgiades, foreign depositors, mainly Russians, will ultimately hold a majority of the Bank of Cyprus's new voting shares. Lawyers representing clients with blocked money estimate that Russians as a group will end up with roughly 60 percent of the bank's new shares. Cypriot media reports estimate that 53 percent of the shares will be held by foreigners, primarily Russians, either directly or through law firms representing their interests. Such an outcome, said Demetris Syllouris, a member of the Cypriot Parliament and president of the European Party, a once enthusiastic pro-Europe political group, is ""exactly the opposite"" of what European leaders, particularly Angela Merkel of Germany, wanted when they set out to cleanse Cyprus's banking system in March. At that time, bailout-weary Northern European countries wanted not so much to rescue the banking sector here as to significantly shrink it, and end what they viewed as its reliance on suspect money from the former Soviet Union. A confidential report by the German foreign intelligence agency, known by its German initials as the B.N.D., painted the island as a haven for money-laundering. It is a picture that the government here has dismissed as grossly inaccurate, but one that has nonetheless helped shape perceptions of Cyprus's banking ills and also its cure. These decisions initially caused outrage in Moscow, prompting angry protests from the Kremlin on behalf of Russians who lost money. But as the Russians' ownership shares have swelled, the Kremlin, which in March denounced the troika's approach as ""unfair, unprofessional and dangerous,"" has stopped complaining, at least in public. A spokesman for the monetary and economic affairs section of the European Commission, the union's Brussels-based executive arm, declined to comment on the prospect of Russians gaining control of Cyprus's principal bank. The Central Bank of Cyprus, which is overseeing efforts to salvage the Bank of Cyprus and to work out its new ownership, said it could not ""speculate"" about whether Russians will control the bank in future. The new shareholders, it added, will meet to appoint a new board on Sept. 9. The bank's former shareholders, meanwhile, have been mostly wiped out. The biggest was a Russian tycoon, Dmitry Rybolovlev, who at one point owned a nearly 10 percent stake and, if he had substantial deposits in the bank, would be among the new shareholders. A spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev declined to comment on his current position. But most of the now largely worthless old shares are in the hands of Cypriots who bought them as a safe, blue-chip investment. Andreas Pittas, chairman of the drug manufacturer Medochemie, one of Cyprus's most successful companies, said he had over the years invested more than $9 million in what he considered ""rock solid"" Bank of Cyprus shares. ""This is all lost,"" he said, adding that he does not really care who now owns the bank so long as they can keep it afloat and avoid another crippling blow to Cyprus's already battered economy. For months, however, the Bank of Cyprus has been caught in suspended animation. Theoretically, the bank is the property of its new, predominantly Russian shareholders. But in reality, it is still under the control of the Central Bank of Cyprus, whose governor, Panicos O. Demetriades, was appointed under the country's former Communist president and has often been at odds with its current leader, Mr. Anastasiades. The central bank has named a new interim board for the Bank of Cyprus and also a new managing director. New shareholders were not consulted. But there is some question as to whether the Russians have been stuck with a lemon. Though protected by restrictions that limit withdrawals to 300 euros a day, the bank is steadily leaking money as depositors, their confidence shattered, slowly drain their accounts. The Bank of Cyprus is a ""zombie bank,"" said Theodore Panayotou, director of the Cyprus International Institute of Management. The central bank disputes this, asserting in a July statement that the Bank of Cyprus had been ""fully recapitalized"" thanks to the forced deposits-for-shares conversion and will now be able to ""support the Cyprus economy."" Vangelis Georgiou, a Nicosia businessman whose company had millions deposited in the Bank of Cyprus, said depositors, having waited five months for clarity on the bank's exact ownership and future, have now mostly given up hope. Russian depositors, he said, now want to focus on building their own businesses, ""not on saving the Bank of Cyprus."" He added, ""The game is lost."" All the same, Cypriot lawyers and accountants representing Russians with blocked money have scrambled to try to form a united front to the central bank, which they feel has paid little heed to their clients' concerns. ""They want us to deliver the bank to them so they can assert their rights,"" said Michalis Moushouttas, one of several lawyers working to coordinate diverse Russian shareholders. The Russians' main interest, he said, is to eventually get their blocked deposits back. But this means that they also have an interest in keeping their money in the Bank of Cyprus: yanking out what they can would only destroy a bank they now own, further hurting their chances of getting their money back. ""They have no choice but to stay,"" Mr. Moushouttas said. Michael Olympios, head of the Cyprus Investors Association, a lobbying group, said he did not see any serious risk in having Russians in control of the country's biggest, albeit gravely ill, bank. ""We are not in the cold war anymore,"" he said. ""It is ironic,"" Mr. Olympios added. ""The Germans tried to get rid of Russian money and they ended up with a shareholder structure stacked with Russian oligarchs.""

2540,1415525112.xml,"       BERLIN --  German prosecutors have charged Uli Hoeness, the president of the soccer juggernaut Bayern Munich, with tax evasion. The charge came after a long investigation into the financial dealings of one of Germany's most storied sports figures. Hoeness helped guide Bayern, the dominant team in German soccer, to the Champions League title this year. Hoeness's announcement in April that he had maintained a bank account in Switzerland for years and used it to evade taxes shattered his image as a straight-talking, upstanding sports hero. Hoeness said the account was strictly for his personal use for trading on the stock market and had no connections to Bayern. Hoeness's lawyers have one month to respond to the charges, a Munich state court said Tuesday. After that, a criminal court that handles financial cases will decide whether to go to trial, dismiss the case, or request more information.  A decision is not expected before the end of September, Andrea Titz, a spokeswoman for the Munich court, said in a statement. She refused to talk about the details of the charges, including the amount of money involved, pending the financial court's announcement on how it will proceed. ""No details of the charges can be released before the court's decision whether to open the case, particularly given that certain obligations of confidentiality apply to tax evasion cases,"" Titz said. It has been a year of contrasts for Hoeness, 61, a former national team player who helped West Germany win the 1974 World Cup on its home turf. He has spent the past 30 years helping Bayern Munich build up financial reserves rarely seen in European club soccer. In April, he went public with his story that he had informed the tax authorities about a private bank account he held in Switzerland at the start of the year. Prosecutors then began an investigation and issued a warrant for his arrest. He was released on bail. ""Between 2002 and 2006, I really gambled,"" Hoeness told the German newspaper Die Zeit in an interview in May. ""Day and night, I traded with sums that today are hard for me to get my head around, they were extreme. It was a kick, pure adrenaline."" His revelations, coming in an election year in Germany, stirred a national debate over social justice and equality. Opposition politicians seized on the opportunity to hold up Hoeness, who had close ties to Chancellor Angela Merkel, as an example of her government's leniency toward wealthy tax evaders. The chancellor distanced herself from Hoeness, but Bayern fans circled their wagons around him, chanting, ""Uli Hoeness, you are the best!"" through the stadium June 1 after the team secured the final jewel in the triple crown of German soccer, the German Cup, after winning the league title and the Champions League. It is the first team in the country to have won all three in a season. Instead of joining in the festivities of beer showers and a series of parades through the streets of Munich in the following weeks, Hoeness stayed largely in the shadows. The team's supervisory board voted unanimously in May to keep him as president, saying at the time that it would address the issue again when more information became available. The club declined Tuesday to comment on the charges. In his most recent remarks on the affair last week, Hoeness credited Bayern fans and the board members for supporting him in the months since he came forward, and he sounded upbeat about the outcome. ""We need to wait and see how things develop,"" Hoeness told public ZDF television last week on the sideline of a friendly between Bayern Munich and Barcelona that carried his name, the Uli Hoeness Cup. ""I am confident that a satisfactory solution will be found."" Uli Hoeness, the President of Bayern Munich, Previously Admitted to Maintaining a Bank Account in Switzerland.

3831,1652142056.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- As President Obama officially rolled out a new national security strategy for his final two years in office, his top foreign policy aide on Friday denounced ""alarmism"" over various international crises, saying the challenges now facing the United States are nothing like those presented in the past by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Susan E. Rice, the president's national security adviser, said the Obama administration would stand strong in its efforts to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine and to defeat the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. But she defended Mr. Obama against critics who blame him for the many geopolitical eruptions that have occurred seemingly all at once. ""Too often, what's missing here in Washington is a sense of perspective,"" Ms. Rice said in a speech at the Brookings Institution introducing the 29-page security document. ""Yes, there is a lot going on. Still, while the dangers we face may be more numerous and varied, they are not of the existential nature we confronted during World War II or during the Cold War. We cannot afford to be buffeted by alarmism in a nearly instantaneous news cycle."" The new security strategy, the first in five years and the last planned for the Obama era, asserts that the United States will continue to play a strong leadership role in the world but that it must recognize the limits of American power as well. It argues that even as Washington confronts short-term threats, it should not lose sight of longer-term issues like climate change, trade, poverty, cybersecurity and global health. Some Republicans called the document another articulation of passivity. ""This new 'strategy' is a regurgitation of the same failed policies that have engendered an international environment of weakness and made the United States and our allies around the world less safe,"" said Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Peter D. Feaver, who helped write a national security strategy for President George W. Bush in 2006, said the Obama document did not deal candidly with how much it exposed the flawed premises of the president's last such strategy in 2010. ""The 2015 N.S.S. does talk about things that have changed, but without acknowledging how much the changes rebut the logic of President Obama's first-term strategic approach,"" Mr. Feaver said. To make her point about not letting crises of the day dominate American diplomacy, Ms. Rice announced that Mr. Obama had invited the leaders of China, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia to visit him separately at the White House in the coming months. The invitations are part of the president's longstanding, if sometimes fitful effort to ""rebalance"" American foreign policy so that it focuses more on Asia, the region of the future, and not simply be consumed by conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, the areas that have dominated Washington's attention for decades. President Xi Jinping of China and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan will each be accorded a state visit or a similarly grand reception, with all the pomp and circumstance that come with such occasions. Mr. Xi visited Mr. Obama in California in 2013 and hosted him in Beijing last fall, but it will be his first White House visit since taking office. Mr. Abe last visited the White House in 2013. While he is not a head of state -- that would be the Japanese emperor -- Mr. Abe will be given the same treatment as if he were, officials said. Additionally, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and President Joko Widodo of Indonesia will come on what are called working visits, without the trappings of a South Lawn arrival ceremony and a formal state dinner. Those will be the first White House meetings for either leader, both of whom were elected in the last two years. The announcement came just after Mr. Obama's recent trip to India made him the first American president to visit that country twice while in office. Mr. Obama used the trip to encourage India to play a greater role in Asia and found a willing partner in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who privately shared his unease with China's efforts to assert itself in the region. ""As we update our existing international system, our strategy is to enhance our focus on regions that will shape the century ahead, starting with the Asia-Pacific,"" Ms. Rice said. ""Our rebalance is deepening longstanding alliances and forging new partnerships to expand cooperation."" But the day's developments underscored how hard it can be for the administration to focus on long-term strategy when it is grappling with the latest upheaval around the world. Even as Ms. Rice was speaking, American officials were evaluating a claim by the Islamic State that a Jordanian airstrike had killed an American hostage. And the leaders of Germany and France were in Moscow trying to negotiate peace in Ukraine. In response to questions after her speech, Ms. Rice acknowledged that the administration was rethinking its opposition to sending arms to Ukraine, but she gave little hint as to what decision might be made or when it might be made. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who repeated her opposition to arming Ukraine in the days before she traveled to Moscow, is due to visit Mr. Obama in Washington on Monday. ""Obviously it's a significant step,"" Ms. Rice said, ""and we will want to do so in close consultation, adding coordination with our partners whose unity on this issue with us thus far has been a core element of our strength in responding to Russia's aggression.""

1780,1036816002.xml,"       BERLIN -- Continuing a fast pace of international diplomacy, Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting China on Thursday and Friday for the second time in seven months, acting as a conduit both for German business and the European Union. Accompanied by seven ministers and the most influential business delegation of her six trips to date to China, Ms. Merkel is expected to explain the current state of the euro crisis to a curious Chinese leadership, and perhaps to seek Chinese investment in Europe's bailout funds. Both countries -- two of the world's biggest exporters -- have weathered the economic crisis relatively well to date, but China's growth is now sputtering while debt is crippling some European countries and even German growth is slowing markedly. Since Ms. Merkel returned from a vacation in the Alps two weeks ago, she has visited Canada and Moldova; played host to President François Hollande of France and the Greek and Italian prime ministers for talks on the euro crisis; and met several domestic obligations as well. Germany's status as the economic powerhouse in Europe appears to be lending her increasing weight as an effective spokeswoman for the 17-nation euro zone and the 27 members of the European Union. The trip is her second in seven months, although such consultations normally take place only once a year. German officials said that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao -- who himself has visited Germany six times -- had requested the chancellor's return before a Chinese leadership turnover that will see him hand over power early next year.  ""It was very important to the prime minister that these governmental consultations took place again, before the change of leadership in the party, to institutionalize them,"" a German official told reporters in Berlin. Such high-level government exchanges have been a way for postwar Germany to deepen relations with allies like France, Israel, Poland and Russia. The consultations with China, which began in June 2011 when Mr. Wen and 13 of his ministers visited Berlin, have resulted in a significant increase in trade between the two countries, which reached $169 billion in 2011, an 18.9 percent increase from 2010. Nearly half of all exports from the European Union to China now come from Germany, with machines and luxury cars especially in demand. The European Union is also the biggest destination for Chinese exports.  But recent figures show the Chinese economy cooling down; growth for 2012 is projected to be about 8 percent, against 9.2 percent in 2011. In Germany, where the economy is largely driven by exports, there are indications that the euro crisis, now into its third year, is beginning to take a toll. The Chinese prime minister has indicated a willingness to invest in Europe's bailout funds, and Ms. Merkel may seek firmer commitments on this front. The German economy posted 0.3 percent growth in the second quarter of 2012, and a leading survey of business sentiment by the Ifo Institute showed German companies beginning to express greater pessimism. In China, Mr. Wen has been visiting coastal factories to better manage a downturn that some analysts fear could lead to huge layoffs and social unrest.  Keeping trade between two of the world's biggest exporters buoyant seems to be high on the agenda.  Following a day of meetings in Beijing with Mr. Wen and other officials, including his designated successor, Li Keqiang, the chancellor will head to Tianjin, where she is to hold talks with business representatives and visit an Airbus factory where A320 airliners are assembled. Although government officials say Ms. Merkel's visit will involve a tour and private talks, the German news media have reported that Airbus's parent company, European Aeronautic Defense & Space, is hoping to secure an order for 100 of the planes from China during the trip. Beijing is holding back, demanding that it be excluded from an E.U. system designed to curb carbon transmissions.  The Chinese, along with other Asian nations, are pushing the European Union to wait for a global system, but the Europeans are insistent on pushing through the curbs. Such differences cut to the crux of the problems between the two nations, which are trade rivals as much as they are partners. Critics charge that closer German-Chinese ties pose a danger for Europe, coming as it struggles to develop a more strategic approach to China. Chinese companies were the largest investor in Germany last year, with 158 projects, or almost 20 percent of the total, according to Germany Trade and Invest, the government's economic development agency, surpassing the United States for the first time. The 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries will be Oct. 1. Fans of the Berlin Zoo can hope that Mr. Wen might note this anniversary with a special gift, after the panda Bao Bao died this month at age 34. The panda was a gift from Hua Guofeng, the Chinese leader at the time, to the West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai.

FILE -- President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the administration’s response to the military coup in Myanmar, at the South Court Auditorium at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2021. Biden's vow to restore the trans-Atlantic alliance is welcome, but Europeans want a more balanced relationship, with more dialogue and less diktat. (Oliver Contreras/The New York Times)


WASHINGTON — Two weeks after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke publicly about the importance of dialogue with Moscow, saying that Russia is a part of Europe that cannot simply be shunned and that Europe must be strong enough to defend its own interests.
On Dec. 30, just weeks before the inauguration, the European Union clinched an important investment agreement with China, days after a tweet by Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, asking for “early consultations” with Europe on China and seeming to caution against a quick deal.
On Friday, Biden will address the Munich Security Conference, a gathering of leaders and diplomats from Europe and the United States that he has attended for decades and that helped cement his reputation as a champion of trans-Atlantic solidarity.
Speaking at the conference two years ago, Biden lamented the damage the Trump administration had inflicted on the once-sturdy postwar relationship between Washington and Europe’s major capitals. “This too shall pass,” Biden said. “We will be back.” He promised that America would again “shoulder our responsibility of leadership.”
Biden’s remarks Friday are sure to repeat that promise and spotlight his now-familiar call for a more unified Western front against the anti-democratic threats posed by Russia and China. In many ways such talk is sure to be received like a warm massage by European leaders tensed and shellshocked by four years of former President Donald Trump’s mercurial and often contemptuous diplomacy.
But if by “leadership” Biden means a return to the traditional U.S. assumption — we decide and you follow — many Europeans feel that world is gone and that Europe must not behave like America’s junior wingman in fights defined by Washington.
Demonstrated by the EU’s trade deal with China and conciliatory talk about Moscow from leaders like Macron and Germany’s likely next chancellor, Armin Laschet, Europe has its own set of interests and ideas about how to manage America’s two main rivals — ones that will complicate Biden’s diplomacy.
“Biden is signaling an incredibly hawkish approach to Russia, lumping it in with China, and defining a new global Cold War against authoritarianism,” said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
That makes many European leaders nervous, Shapiro said. And other regional experts said they had seen fewer signs of overt enthusiasm from the continent than Biden administration officials might have hoped for.

“There was always a clear-eyed recognition that we weren’t just going to be able to show up and say, ‘Hey, guys, we’re back!,’” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who was in line to become the National Security Council director for Russia but who did not take the job for personal reasons.
“But even with all of that, I think there was optimism that it would be easier than it looks like it’s going to be,” said Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

Ulrich Speck, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said, “After the freeze in relations under Trump, I expected more warming. I don’t see it yet.”
Biden quickly took many of the easiest steps toward reconciliation and unity with Europe, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement, renewing an emphasis on multilateralism and human rights, and vowing to rejoin the disintegrating 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
But aligning against Russia and China will be much more difficult.
China may be a peer rival for America, but it has long been a vital trade partner for Europe, and while European leaders see Beijing as a systemic rival and competitor, they also see it as a partner and hardly view it as an enemy.
And Russia remains a nuclear-armed neighbor, however truculent, and has financial and emotional leverage of its own.

Since Biden was last in the White House during the Obama administration, moreover, Britain, historically America’s most reliable diplomatic partner, has left the EU and now coordinates foreign policy less effectively with its continental allies.
“That sophisticated British view of the world is absent,” said Nicholas Burns, a former undersecretary of state and ambassador to NATO in the George W. Bush administration. “I don’t think the U.S. is intertwined yet with Europe, diplomatically and strategically,” he added.

This week’s security conference is not run by the German government, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will address it along with Biden, Macron and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. And Germany itself illustrates some of the problems the Biden administration will face in its effort to lock arms against Moscow.
Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Party has chosen Laschet as party leader, and he is their likely candidate to succeed her in autumn elections. But Laschet is more sympathetic than Biden to both Russia and China. He has cast doubt on the extent of Russian political disinformation and cyberhacking operations and publicly criticized “marketable anti-Putin populism.” He also has been a strong supporter of Germany’s export-led economy, which is deeply reliant on China.
Germany still intends to put into operation the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a 746-mile natural gas artery that runs under the Baltic Sea from northern Russia to Germany. The paired pipelines are owned by Gazprom, itself owned by Russia. Work stopped on the project last year — with 94% of the pipes laid — after the U.S. Congress imposed further sanctions on the project on the grounds that it helps fund the Kremlin, damages Ukraine and gives Russia the potential to manipulate Europe’s energy supply.
Last year, German politicians responded to threats of economic punishment made by Republican U.S. senators by claiming “blackmail,” “economic war” and “neo-imperialism.” Many want to complete the project, but Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters that Biden opposes the pipeline project as a “bad deal” that divides Europe and makes it more vulnerable to Russian treachery.
Despite the sanctions, Russian ships have renewed laying pipes, and Merkel defends the project as a business venture, not a geopolitical statement. The Germans argue that EU energy regulations and new pipeline configurations reduce Russia's ability to manipulate supplies and that Russia is more dependent on the income than Europe is on the gas.
There are signs that, as with the China deal, the Biden administration wants to move on and negotiate a solution with Germany, to remove a major irritant with a crucial ally. That could include, some suggest, snapback sanctions if Moscow diverts supplies or halts transit fees to Ukraine.

In France, Macron has long sought to develop a more positive dialogue with Putin, but his efforts for a “reset” have gone nowhere. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, tried something similar this month with embarrassing results, when Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia humiliated him at a news conference and called the EU “an unreliable partner.”
Together with the attempted assassination and then the jailing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the treatment of Borrell means that Brussels is likely to add new sanctions on Russia, but not before the end of March, and will be more open to Biden’s suggestions for a tougher line.
Biden administration officials say that coordinating with fractious Europe has never been easy and that its leaders welcome restored U.S. leadership — especially on a Chinese threat more apparent to Europe than it was five years ago.

As for China and the investment agreement, after seven years of difficult talks, European officials have defended it as largely an effort to obtain the same access to the China market for their companies that U.S. firms had received through Trump’s China deal last year.
“There is no reason for us to suffer from an unlevel playing field, including vis-à-vis the U.S.,” Sabine Weyand, the EU director general for trade, said in a virtual forum in early February. “Why should we sit still?”
Weyand said the deal set high standards for Chinese trade practices, which would ultimately put the United States and Europe “in a stronger position to have a more assertive policy together on China.”
The deal must be ratified by the European Parliament, however, which has been critical of its failure to guarantee more labor rights, and it is unlikely to come to a vote until much later this year. And again, Biden administration officials seem to be willing to move on, given the importance of cooperation with Europe on China.
“The deal potentially could complicate trans-Atlantic cooperation on China,” said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, “but I don’t think it’s going to preclude it.”

2828,851394225.xml,"      Personal honors never meant much to Bill Russell, one of America's most successful athletes, with 2 college titles, 1 Olympic gold medal and 11 -- count 'em, 11 --  N.B.A. championships with the Boston Celtics.   He has never visited the Basketball Hall of Fame, where he was the first black N.B.A. player enshrined, in 1975. He has his reasons; he always does.   Given his blast-from-the-past '60s positions on race and just about anything, Russell is often asked about his reaction to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he will receive from President Obama on Tuesday, as will former President George H. W. Bush,  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Stan   Musial and 11 others.   Is this the greatest personal honor in his life?   ""A close second,"" Russell replied.   Umm, what's first? The tentativeness of the question elicited the familiar whooping roar of laughter occasionally emitted by this publicly serious man.   ""When he was about 77, my father and I were talking,"" Russell answered. ""And he said: 'You know, you're all grown up now, and I want to tell you something. You know, I am very proud of the way you turned out as my son, and I'm proud of you as a father.'    ""My father is my hero, O.K., and I cannot perceive of anything topping that,"" Russell continued, his voice becoming husky. This being the mature Bill Russell, born on Lincoln's birthday in 1934, he saw fit to add, ""While I am very, very flattered by this honor.""   Russell will take along much of his family, along with Jim Brown and Joe Morgan, whom he regards as allies, great African-American athletes who spoke their minds.    ""I said, 'You were part of this team, like John Lewis and Maya Angelou, some of the medal winners,' "" said his daughter, Karen Kenyatta Russell, a lawyer, almost as if she needed to talk her father into accepting the honor.   ""Weren't they the predicate in a way for Obama?"" she said. ""Before Oprah. He was the first black coach in major sports; people saw someone like him.""   When he was flicking away opponents' shots, Russell intimidated the world not only with his long arms, but also with his silent stares and strong opinions. For many decades, Russell refused to visit Fenway Park, until new management convinced him it had exorcised vestiges of racism.    He has stayed away from the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., he said, because he represented team play, not individual accomplishment  --  and besides, he recalled, he was denied an individual honor while in college.   In a telephone conversation recently, Russell just happened to recall the spring of 1966, when he was named the first black coach in a major professional sport in the United States.   ""I remember at the press conference,"" he said, ""probably the second or third question one of the Boston reporters asked me, 'Can you coach the white guys without being prejudiced?' Now, I didn't recall anybody asking a white coach if he could coach the black guys without being prejudiced. All I said was, 'Yeah.' ""   New generations have no idea what it was like back then. Russell was born in West Monroe, La.; his parents knew people who had been born slaves. Once his mother made a handsome suit for herself, and police officers told her not to wear ""white women's clothes,"" Karen Russell  said.    ""Black people had to wait in line at a drugstore or gas station, and white people went first,"" she continued. ""One day, my grandfather tried to pull away from a gas line, and the owner pulled a shotgun and said, 'Boy, you're going to buy your gas from me.' ""   In a telephone interview, she described Russell as the personification of Isabel Wilkerson's new book, ""The Warmth of Other Suns,"" about the black journey to northern cities.    ""My father says it was not a migration but an immigration,"" she said, meaning to another country. Russell told her that if his father had stayed in Louisiana, ""He said he either would have killed or been killed.""    Charlie and Katie Russell moved with their two sons to Oakland, Calif., where  she died at 32, but not before telling him to make sure the boys got an education. The older son, Charlie L. Russell, became a playwright. A scout spotted the gangly William Russell in a high school game and directed him to Coach Phil Woolpert at the University of San Francisco.   ""I was an innovator,"" Russell said. ""I started blocking shots although I had never seen a shots blocked before that. The first time I did that in a game, my coach called timeout and said, 'No good defensive player ever leaves his feet.' ""    Russell did it anyway, and the Dons won 55 straight games and national titles in 1955 and 1956. Then Russell led the United States to a gold medal at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, and joined the Celtics, who had never won a championship.   He has always given credit to the team's white owner, Walter Brown, and its white coach, the irascible, pragmatic Red Auerbach. The Celtics began to win, and they kept adding great players, most of them black. When Tom Heinsohn was hurt, Auerbach started Willie Naulls in his place, and days later, Russell said, they were told they were the first N.B.A. team to start five blacks.    Russell dominated everybody -- economically blocking shots toward his teammates, changing the flow of his sport. Tom Meschery, an opponent, wrote a poem about him, calling him an ""eagle with a beard.""   When Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965-66 title, the team agreed Russell should become the playing coach.    ""My allegiance was to the Boston Celtics,"" Russell said. ""I took the job not as a social statement, but for what I thought was the right reason. I would be the best guy for that job at that time.""   The Celtics won titles in two of three seasons with him as player-coach, then he gave up playing, with 11 N.B.A. titles in 13 seasons, in a time when it was not exactly clear if the center would hold.   Russell's journey continued, with jazz and politics and poetry in the house. Angelou, who will also receive a medal  Tuesday, visited one time and later wrote a poem, ""Little Girl Speakings,"" about a little girl who worships her daddy and her mommy. Yet the Russell marriage broke up. Karen, 11 at the time, chose to stay with her father, and her two brothers, William Jr. and Jacob, went with their mother. Russell told Karen he knew nothing about raising girls; years later, he told her he had tried to make her be like Billie Jean King, a recipient of the presidential medal last year.    Karen Russell went to Georgetown and Harvard Law School -- ""brought me out of retirement three times,"" Russell said with that whoop, referring to coaching and broadcasting gigs, to pay the tuition. She is now a corporate diversity and employment lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle.    When Russell first met Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, years apart, they both began the conversations by saying: ""I know you. You're Karen Russell's father."" She said, ""Very canny of both of them.""   Russell's third marriage, to Marilyn Nault, was a love affair. They drove across the country; they laughed a lot; she told him to get out more. This most private of humans recently shared one of the most intimate moments in any life.    He and Marilyn were invited to the Obama inauguration in January 2009, but she was dying of cancer in Seattle. She urged him to go, but when he landed in Washington, he heard she had taken a downward turn, and he got back on a plane.   ""We held hands and watched the inauguration,"" he said. ""We sat there all night, and then I said, 'Listen, I'm going to take a shower, now wait for me, I'll be right back,' and she said she'd wait. Well, as soon as I left she died. So I said to the nurse, 'She promised she would wait,' and the nurse said this happens quite commonly. A lot of people don't want their loved ones to see them die. And so it was like we shared this moment together and she did not want me to see her die.""   When he was notified about the medal, he said, ""I went down to the grave and shared it with her, and I do that now and then.""   Russell will carry her rosary with him to the White House.   And what does he, the country's first black professional coach, think about receiving a medal from its first black president? He has kept up with Obama, attending a private birthday game last August with many current and former stars.    ""Well, you know, I know him for a while, long before he was president,"" Russell said.  ""And the last time I talked to him, I said, I am very proud of him, not because he is the first black president, but 'because you're an intelligent, competent politician and you arrived at the top of your profession, and so, I'm proud of you for your accomplishments as a man.' ""    He sounded just like his father, Charlie Russell, at 77.   Bill Russell Is to Receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

3783,1776400052.xml,"       Goodbye to all that. Now we know that Donald Trump would rip up the post-1945 world order, trash an ""obsolete"" NATO, lean toward a Japan with nukes rather than the ""one-sided agreement"" that leaves the United States responsible for Japanese defense, tell Saudi Arabia that it ""wouldn't be around for very long"" without American protection, and generally make clear that ""we cannot be the policeman of the world."" So much for Pax Americana; it was a bad deal, you see, and in the Trump universe the deal is everything. American power and far-flung American garrisons may have underwritten global security and averted nuclear war for more than seven decades, but they cannot be sustained by the ""poor country"" the United States has become. Why? Because, he insists, the whole postwar setup is a scam. That Trump could be the next president of the United States is no longer a fanciful notion. Americans don't want business as usual; Trump is not business as usual. He's ranting and schmoozing his way to the White House as the man who, through some alchemy, will make an anxious America proud again. The world -- already more combustible than at any time in recent decades -- may be about to become a much more dangerous place. Trump, in interviews with my colleagues Maggie Haberman and David Sanger, said: ""We have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big bully, but we were not smartly led."" America was ""systematically ripped off by everybody. From China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend."" Bottom line of Trump foreign policy: ""We will not be ripped off anymore"" because ""we don't have any money."" He would like to see the United States ""really starting to go robust,"" as it did around 1900. A lot of what Trump said was just plain wrong. He declared that he was ""all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,"" but those friends don't seem to have explained what's going on. He is irked because countries like Germany ""didn't seem to be very much involved"" when Russia got ""very confrontational"" (a.k.a. annexed Crimea and started a war in eastern Ukraine), and so the burden fell on the United States. In fact, Germany has taken a central role in orchestrating sanctions against Russia and, unlike the United States, is at the table in the Minsk peace process for Ukraine. Perhaps it's unsurprising that Trump dismisses Germany's role in that he believes Europe's most powerful nation by far is ""being destroyed"" by ""tremendous crime"" (presumably on the part of unmentioned Muslim refugees) and by Chancellor Angela Merkel's ""naïveté or worse"" (presumably in letting said Syrian refugees in). He also believes that the United States is ""obsolete in cyber,"" a view Iran would not share, and that ""our country doesn't have money"" (it does have some). But that Trump and facts are uneasy partners is already well known. What was not so apparent before these interviews was how radical a President Trump would be in dismantling the architecture of postwar stability -- unless, of course, he changed his mind to demonstrate the unpredictability he prizes. To say NATO is obsolete -- a view Moscow has been pressing since the end of the Cold War as a means to get the United States out of Europe -- at a time when President Vladimir Putin is determined to assert Russian power is dangerous folly. Ask the Baltic States that have been spared Putin's aggression only because they are now NATO members. NATO remains the pillar of the trans-Atlantic cooperation that forged a Europe whole and free from the ruins and divisions of 1945. To countenance a nuclear-armed Japan at a time when China's rapid rise and designs in the East China Sea have sharpened tensions between the two countries is also to play a high-risk game. The presence of the United States as an Asian power offsetting China's rise and reassuring smaller nations in the hemisphere is a principal reason that rise has been peaceful. As for the disintegration of Saudi Arabia, which Trump seems ready to accept if the Saudis don't step up to the plate financially and militarily, it may well make Syria look like a playground. Trump is right about one thing. The world of 2016 is not that of 1945 or 1990. The United States is relatively weaker, power is shifting, there are pressing domestic priorities. But his version of ""America First"" -- which interestingly converges with the views of many on the left who are convinced that the United States should stop policing the world -- looks like a recipe for cataclysm. War in Estonia or the East China Sea could end up being a very bad deal indeed, a real rip-off for all humanity.

3090,1283629728.xml,"       MOSCOW -- Four years ago, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used an audience of world leaders at an annual security conference in Munich to propose a ""reset"" with Russia, the Obama administration's first big foreign policy statement. But as Mr. Biden arrives in Germany for the same conference this weekend, the United States is quietly adopting a new approach to its old cold war rival: the cold shoulder. The intense engagement on the reset led to notable achievements, including the New Start nuclear arms treaty and Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. But after more than a year of deteriorating relations, the administration now envisions a period of disengagement, according to government officials and outside analysts here and in Washington. The pullback -- which may well be a topic of discussion when Mr. Biden meets with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on the sidelines of the conference -- is a response to months of intensifying political repression in Russia since Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency last May and a number of actions perceived by Washington as anti-American.  Because American officials do not want to worsen the relationship and still hope for cooperation, they declined to publicly describe the plans. But within the administration it is taken for granted that the relationship with Russia is far less of a priority. ""We have real differences, and we don't hide them,"" said Tony Blinken, who has served as Mr. Biden's national security adviser and is now joining the president's national security team.  Briefing reporters before the Germany trip, Mr. Blinken said: ""We have differences over human rights and democracy. We have differences over -- in a number of areas that have been in the media in recent days and weeks.""  The distancing began with the recent withdrawal by the United States from the ""civil society working group,"" one of 20 panels created in 2009 to carry out the reset between Moscow and Washington under an umbrella organization known as the Obama-Medvedev Commission. If that step was barely perceptible outside diplomatic circles, the strategy will soon become far more obvious. American officials say President Obama will decline an invitation -- publicly trumpeted by Mr. Lavrov and the Russian news media -- to visit Moscow on his own this spring. Instead, he will wait until September, when the G-20 conference of the world's largest economies is scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg, Russia.  And while Secretary of State John Kerry has yet to select his first overseas destination, officials said Russia had been ruled out. The main goal seems to be to send a message that the United States views much of its relationship with Russia as optional, and while pressing matters will continue to be handled on a transactional basis, Washington plans to continue criticizing Russia on human rights and other concerns. As for the anti-Americanism, the new approach might be described as shrug and snub.  Nevertheless, Mr. Blinken said there was real potential to work through the differences. And American officials are clearly betting that Mr. Putin desires a prominent role on the world stage and will ultimately decide to re-engage.  But the chances of that seem slim. Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, warned that a pullback would be a shirking of American responsibility to work with Russia to maintain global stability. He said that Russia wanted to improve economic ties and build a stronger relationship, but that the United States must stay out of Russia's affairs.  ""We have heard numerous times the word in Washington that Russia's domestic affairs are not satisfactory,"" Mr. Peskov said. ""Unfortunately these voices cannot be taken into account here, and we cannot agree with them. We are a genuine democratic country, and we are taking care of ourselves.""  In the nearly three years since the signing of the New Start treaty, followed by Russia's vote two months later at the Security Council in support of sanctions on Iran, American officials say only one major thing has changed: the return of Mr. Putin to the presidency.  Confronted by the emergence of a potent political opposition movement among Moscow's urban middle class, Mr. Putin has taken steps since his inauguration last May to suppress political dissent. Many of those steps were also seen in Washington as anti-American and undermining human rights.  These included the prosecution and jailing of members of the punk band Pussy Riot; the decision to end more than 20 years of cooperation on public health programs and civil society initiatives run by the United States Agency for International Development; cancellation of a partnership to dismantle unconventional weapons; and approval of legislative initiatives clamping down on pro-democracy groups and other nonprofit organizations. The final straw appeared to be a law signed by Mr. Putin in December prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by American citizens, which the Kremlin said was retaliation for a new American law punishing Russian human rights violators. Senior Obama administration officials viewed the adoption ban not only as geopolitically disproportionate, but so utterly cruel in denying orphans the chance to join a family that it left many speechless and some near tears. That the Russian government would put children in the political cross-fire convinced American officials that they were not confronting political theatrics, as they believed when Mr. Putin was running for re-election, but rather an increasingly idiosyncratic government driven by Russian domestic concerns, especially Mr. Putin's fears of popular unrest. ""It's a feeling of frustration that Putin and company are unnecessarily imposing strains on the Russian and American relationship,"" Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, now a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a telephone interview. ""I would not construe that as saying that Russia needs to be downgraded, or is irrelevant,"" Mr. Brzezinski said, but that ""we do not need it for everything."" Even Russia's most critical role in the global economy, as a major supplier of oil and gas -- particularly to American allies in Europe -- has ebbed, given the rise of the United States as a major producer of shale gas and the return of Iraq as a big oil producer.  At the same time, outside its borders, Russia remains indisputably relevant on a range of global issues, including the threats and opportunities from climate change in the Arctic and the political uncertainty in North Korea, that prevent the United States from pulling back too far.  ""We can manage these issues effectively together, or end up shouting at each other,"" said James F. Collins, who was ambassador to Russia from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. ""Anybody who suggests we are going to disengage and let them stew just doesn't get it. We will have to deal with them."" Matthew Bryza, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Eurasian affairs, said it would be best to deal dispassionately with Moscow.  ""Every American president in my career has come into office thinking that they are going to be the great communicator that makes a breakthrough with Russia,"" Mr. Bryza said. ""As their terms have continued, every president has been disappointed."" He added: ""Russia behaves like Russia. Russia pursues its own hard-core national interests. That is realpolitik. We should de-sentimentalize our relations.""  Credit: DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

4220,2277239713.xml,"LONDON -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, known for his bombast and outspokenness, began his first foreign trip as leader on Wednesday walking a daunting diplomatic tightrope, ostensibly trying to pry Brexit concessions from stony-faced Europeans while keeping a wary eye on his domestic opponents with a general election possible in the fall.And looming over it all for the new prime minister is the vexing problem of President Trump.Mr. Johnson, who spoke about Brexit with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin, on Wednesday, will also meet with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Thursday. But, while Mr. Johnson and Ms. Merkel both promised to try to work out a solution, the talks are not expected to break the deadlock that has poisoned and paralyzed British politics for three years.Then it will be on to Biarritz, France, for a weekend meeting of the Group of 7 countries, where he will have to carefully calibrate his relationship with President Trump, an enthusiastic backer of Brexit who is deeply unpopular throughout the Continent and among Britons.Mr. Johnson, who has stepped up preparations for the possibility of a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, needs the president's help if he is to strike a trade deal with the United States to cushion the economic impact. But he can ill afford to appear too chummy with him.""Johnson's friendship with Trump and their joint admiration society is a liability for him with the Europeans,"" said Julianne Smith, a former United States deputy national security adviser now with the Center for a New American Security, who recently finished a fellowship in Berlin.""The closer he allies himself with Trump the more difficulty he'll have going forward with the Europeans, from trade to security,"" she said.Nor would a closer relationship be popular with large numbers of British voters who heartily dislike Mr. Trump, not least for his positions on Iran and climate change. Mr. Trump early on abandoned the Paris climate accord, and last year, he pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Britain, France and Germany still support. Mr. Trump is expected to try to draw Mr. Johnson away.There is growing speculation that Mr. Johnson is aiming for a general election, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute based in London, since his working parliamentary majority has dwindled to just one. But that presents other perils.""If he is going into an election, he has to be very careful not to be seen as Trump's poodle,"" he said. The opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is already trying to disparage Mr. Johnson as  ""Britain's Trump.""With an eye to that, Mr. Johnson might try to shift the blame for the Brexit impasse onto his European neighbors by painting them as obdurate, Mr. Grant said. The prime minister has also sought to blame domestic opponents of a no-deal Brexit for weakening his bargaining position in negotiations with the European Union, something he has called a ""terrible collaboration.""So Biarritz represents a complicated moment on the international stage for a politician who loves the limelight and is sure to try to use it, like all the other leaders, for his own political purposes.""Boris Johnson understands political theater -- he's perhaps more into theater and communication than substance, so he will understand the importance of moral, emotional and verbal support from Trump while not wanting to alienate France and Germany,"" Mr. Grant said.This is new territory. For several decades the objective of British foreign policy has been to avoid choosing between Europe and the United States, acting instead as a bridge between the two.But that option is fast receding because of the combination of Brexit and Mr. Trump's disdain for the European Union, a bloc that he sees as an economic competitor.Mr. Johnson's tactic is to prepare energetically for a cliff-edge departure at the end of October, hoping that the prospective damage to European economies, especially Ireland, will force Brussels to reopen negotiations on withdrawal and drop the ""backstop"" designed to assure there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which remains a part of the United Kingdom, after Brexit.But there is no sign of that yet. Speaking in Berlin Mr. Johnson said there was ""ample scope"" for a new agreement; Ms. Merkel said there was a need to find, within the next 30 days, a plan to keep goods flowing freely across the Irish border issue. That effectively challenges Britain to produce a detailed, practical solution to a fiendishly complex problem within a few weeks.European leaders do not believe Mr. Johnson is as serious about a no-deal Brexit as he claims to be, are not sure he will survive long with a single-vote majority in any case and believe that it is Britain and Northern Ireland that would suffer most from crashing out, not the European Union. Ms. Merkel told Mr. Johnson that though she does not want such an outcome, she was ""prepared for a no deal.""European diplomats know that a majority in the British Parliament opposes the idea of leaving without an agreement. They will also be loath to make concessions, analysts say, with speculation rife about an imminent election that could scramble British politics. And they remain adamant that Brussels will not sacrifice the interests of a member, Ireland, for those of a country that is heading out the door.For his part, Mr. Johnson knows that any softening of his stance on Brexit would be seized on by the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage.""I think it is a game of poker with two parties at the table, both with a strategy of not showing their cards,"" said Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, a senior adviser at the Bertelsmann Stiftung, a research institute in Germany.That means that the meetings in Berlin, Paris and Biarritz will be about message-sending at a critical moment in the European and British parliamentary timetable, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.""London will see if Johnson gets anywhere with them, but if it's a disaster and he gets slapped down on the backstop from Merkel and Macron it will have implications in the House of Commons and lead to more frenzied talks about votes of confidence,"" Mr. Leonard said.If Mr. Johnson wants to test the Europeans by threatening a no-deal Brexit, ""this is also an opportunity for Macron and Merkel to deliver messages to the British political class,"" Mr. Leonard said.""Most European leaders do not believe that there is a parliamentary majority for a no-deal, so they may decide it's worth being unyielding and see if the British Parliament does something in September.""If some of Mr. Johnson's advisers believe that the European side will cave in at the last moment, they are mistaken, Mr. Grant said.""I really don't think that the E.U. is going to move,"" he said. ""I don't see why that would be in its interest, and why it would not be in its interests to stand up to Europe's mini-Trump.""Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said that Ms. Merkel would be polite and professional during the Berlin meeting. But he noted that two previous British prime ministers, David Cameron and Theresa May, also pleaded for Ms. Merkel's help with their own European problems, only to go home disappointed.All this leaves precious little time for any Brexit solution before Oct. 31 and, to complicate the picture, Europeans see Mr. Johnson as a difficult interlocutor.A former journalist who pilloried the workings of Brussels, he was a leading pro-Brexit campaigner in the 2016 referendum and is regarded in continental Europe as Britain's least successful recent foreign secretary when he held the post from 2016-18.""He was known in all the other foreign ministries as unreliable and not on top of his dossiers,"" said Mr. Fritz-Vannahme.So, while there is still hope in continental Europe and it can chart a course to a smooth Brexit that retains close cooperation with Britain not just on trade but on security too, there is growing pessimism.""We will all pay for Brexit, but we won't pay as high a price as the British,"" Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said. ""We don't have a discussion on the Continent about whether we will run out of medicines and gas.""Credit: By STEPHEN CASTLE and STEVEN ERLANGER; Stephen Castle reported from London, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Berlin on Wednesday and with President Trump last year, faces tricky challenges in relations with Europe.

3368,1818132058.xml,"       Paris, Ky. -- After Bill Bissett, the president of the Kentucky Coal Association, told me that ""President Obama cares more about Paris, France, than he does about Paris, Kentucky"" -- a sentiment that seems broadly shared around here -- I decided to check out this little town with a big name set amid the verdant undulations of picket-fenced Kentucky horse country. Soon enough I ran into Cindy Hedges, whose boot store stands on Main Street and whose hours, as described by a sign on the door, are: ""If I'm here, I'm here. If I ain't, I ain't."" Straight talk, the way the people of this particular Paris like it, is the kind of talk they recognize in Donald J. Trump. Hedges is a garrulous woman who says she's ""never met a stranger."" But recent times have tried her affability. Her business has been slow. Her husband, Mitch, lost his job as the coal business collapsed, she has been withdrawing money from savings, and the couple are struggling to afford health insurance. All of which has led her to the conviction that the country is off track and needs ""somebody spectacular to get us halfway straight."" For her, that somebody is Trump. She voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and says her political choices are gut-driven rather than party-driven. ""I have never been this political,"" she tells me. ""This is the most fired-up I've ever been for a candidate."" She believes Trump will get business going, revoke trade deals she sees as draining domestic jobs, and ""clean up the mess Obama has left us."" But what, I ask, of Trump's evident character flaws? ""Sure, he's kind of a loose cannon, but he tells it the way it is and, if elected, people will be there to calm him down a bit, tweak a word or two in his speeches. And I just don't trust Hillary Clinton."" Kentucky voted twice for Bill Clinton before going solidly Republican in presidential elections. Now Kentuckians are clambering aboard the Trump train -- and to heck with its destination. Obama is blamed for the collapse of coal, particularly in eastern Kentucky, and the ever more stringent standards of the Environmental Protection Agency. Beyond that, the blame is aimed at airy-fairy liberals more concerned about climate change -- often contested or derided -- than about Americans trying to make their house payments. The number of Kentucky coal jobs has plunged to fewer than 6,500 from about 18,000 when Obama took office; the number fell 6.9 percent between this April and June alone. Hillary Clinton's words in Ohio -- ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business"" -- echo on Republican radio ads, plucked out of context from her pledge to replace those jobs with opportunities in clean, renewable energy. By contrast, Trump declared in West Virginia in May that miners should ""get ready, because you are going to be working your asses off!"" ""I don't believe Obama has a white board on how he's going to torture us, but he has,"" Bissett told me at his office in Lexington. ""I cannot tell you how rabid the support for Trump is."" That support is proving resilient. The post-convention Trump free fall has run into the obstinacy of his appeal -- an appeal that seems to defy every gaffe, untruth and insult. The race is tightening once again because Trump's perceived character -- a strong leader with a simple message, never flinching from a fight, cutting through political correctness with a bracing bluntness -- resonates in places like Appalachia where courage, country and cussedness are core values. ""Trump's appeal is nationalistic, the authoritarian shepherd of the flock,"" Al Cross, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, told me. ""That's why evangelical Christians are willing to vote for this twice-divorced man who brags about the size of his penis. There's a strong belief here still in America as special and exceptional, and Obama is seen as having played that down."" But the Trump magnetism goes deeper than resentment at Obama's regretful tone from Havana to Hiroshima. It seems to go beyond the predictable Republican domination in this part of the country. There's a sense, crystallized in coal's steady demise, that, as the political scientist Norman Ornstein put it to me, ""Somebody is taking everything you are used to and you had"" -- your steady middle-class existence, your values, your security. It's not that the economy is bad in all of Kentucky; the arrival of the auto industry has been a boon, and the unemployment rate is just 4.9 percent. It's that all the old certainties have vanished. Far from the metropolitan hubs inhabited by the main beneficiaries of globalization's churn, many people feel disenfranchised from both main political parties, angry at stagnant wages and growing inequality, and estranged from a prevailing liberal urban ethos. I heard a lot about how Obama has not been supportive enough of the police, of how white lives matter, too, and of how illegal -- as in illegal immigrant -- means illegal, just as robbing a bank is. For anyone used to New York chatter, or for that matter London or Paris chatter, Kentucky is a through-the-looking-glass experience. There are just as many certainties; they are simply the opposite ones, whether on immigration, police violence toward African-Americans, or guns. America is now tribal, with each tribe imbibing its own social-media-fed ranting. The Clintons were feted here in the 1990s, but two decades on Hillary Clinton is viewed with cool suspicion. That's because both the economy and values have moved on, too. Jobs went south to Mexico or east to Asia. Somewhere on the winding road from whites-only bathrooms to choose-your-gender bathrooms, many white, blue-collar Kentucky workers -- and the state is 85.1 percent white -- feel their country got lost. The F.D.R. Democrats who became Reagan Democrats and then Clinton Democrats could well be November's Trump Democrats. America is no longer white enough for that to be decisive, but it is significant. To these people, Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" is not the empty rhetoric of a media-savvy con artist from Queens but a last-ditch rallying cry for the soul of a changing land where minorities will be the majority by the middle of the century. Hazard, set in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, is a once bustling town with its guts wrenched out. On Main Street, the skeleton of a mall that burned down last year presents its charred remains for dismal contemplation. Young people with drugged eyes lean against boarded-up walls on desolate streets. The whistle of trains hauling coal, once as regular as the chiming of the hours, has all but vanished. So have the coal trucks spewing splinters of rock that shattered windshields. In the age of cheap natural gas and mountaintop removal mining, a coal town is not where you want to be. Hazard is in Perry County, where unemployment is above 10 percent. On a bench opposite the county courthouse, on the Starbucks-free Main Street, I found Steve Smith and Paul Bush. Smith used to work underground at the Starfire mine. He earned as much as $1,500 a week, but was laid off a while ago. His unemployment has dried up and he has four children to feed. His family scrapes by on his wife's income as a nurse. He'd been in court over a traffic offense; now an idle afternoon stretched away. ""Trump's going to get us killed, probably!"" he told me. ""But I'll vote for him anyway over Hillary. If you vote for Hillary you vote for Obama, and he's made it impossible to ship coal. This place is about dried up. A job at Wendy's is the only thing left. We may have to move."" ""Yeah, another year without change and they'll be shutting Hazard down,"" Bush suggested. He was awaiting his son, in court on a drug charge for the painkiller Percocet. A retired operator of heavy equipment for the Road Department, Bush said his son did nothing, ""just a few odd jobs."" He continued: ""Obama's probably never known hardship. He and Hillary don't get it. At least Trump don't hold nothing back: If he don't like something, he tells you about it."" His son's girlfriend emerged from the courthouse. ""They locked him up,"" she said. ""Why?"" ""He failed one of the drug tests."" ""Well, ain't nothin' we can do about it,"" Bush said. There are people here who are not resigned, people thinking about what can be done about a post-coal Hazard. Self-reliance remains an important Appalachian value even if many people are ""on the draw."" An initiative backed by Congressman Hal Rogers, a Republican, to bring broadband access to rural areas in Kentucky has been announced. Jenny Williams, an English teacher at Hazard Community and Technical College, told me it's past time to get over divisions between ""Friends of Coal"" -- a popular movement and bumper sticker -- and anti-coal environmentalists to forge a creative economy around agriculture, ecotourism, education and small-scale manufacture. Coal, she observed, was never going to last forever. ""How could any idiot support Trump?"" she said. ""But when you've been on $70,000 a year in coal mines, and your life's pulled out from under you, who else can you be mad at but the government?"" That anger simmers. It's directed at Obama, and by extension Clinton, and by further extension a Democratic Party that, as the former Democratic senator Jim Webb from Virginia told me, ""has now built its constituency based on ethnic groups other than white working people."" The frustration of these people, whether they are in Kentucky, or Texas, or throughout the Midwest, is acute. They are looking for ""someone who will articulate the truth of their disenfranchisement,"" as Webb put it. Trump, for all his bullying petulance, has come closest to being that politician, which is why millions of Americans support him. Bissett, the Coal Association president, made clear to me that he did not dismiss the emissions concerns about coal; what bothers him is what he sees as Obama's and the E.P.A.'s refusal to seek a reasonable balance between the economy and the environment. The administration, he argues, has moved the goal posts to kill coal. It is this that feels punitive. For example, the E.P.A.'s Clean Power Plan, first presented in 2014 with no backing from Congress, requires every state to submit proposals for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2018. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, blocked the initiative early this year. But that was just before Justice Antonin Scalia died. ""We need Trump for a reasonable Supreme Court and an E.P.A no longer skewed against fossil fuels,"" Bissett argued. ""A lot of jobs here still depend on coal and cheap electricity. That's why Clinton is toxic right now."" At Jabo's Coal River Grille, a popular restaurant in Hazard, I met Phillip Clemons, known as ""Jabo"" (""perhaps because I used to box""). He owns the Locust Grove mining company, with 15 employees, down from 150. As a hedge, he opened the restaurant, where he was working a shift to keep payroll down. He called the election a ""terrible choice,"" but he's with Trump, because he believes that, as a businessman, Trump will respect the need to ""balance the books,"" past bankruptcies notwithstanding. ""Obama just hates coal,"" he said. ""I don't dislike people because of their color. I liked Herman Cain a lot. I can tell you the only black person who's ever been mean to me is Barack Obama."" What's happened to eastern Kentucky is devastating, but far from unique. At France's diner, another popular Hazard hangout, Daniel Walker, who works from home for a medical software company, told me: ""Look, I lived for a while in Mansfield, Ohio, and General Motors moved its stamping plant there to Mexico, with the loss of thousands of factory jobs. The decent middle-class life is gone."" There are many places, here and abroad, where people feel shoved aside by technology and cheap global labor, leading them to seek radical political answers. Trump is one of those answers; Brexit, the surprise British vote to leave the European Union, was another; the fall of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany next year could be a third, after she trailed an anti-immigrant party in a local election this month. Trump can't reverse globalization. Nor is he likely to save coal in an era of cheap natural gas. His gratuitous insults, evident racism, hair-trigger temper and lack of preparation suggest he would be a reckless, even perilous, choice for the Oval Office. I don't think he is a danger to the Republic because American institutions are stronger than Trump's ego, but that the question even arises is troubling. Still, in a climate where disruption is sought at any cost (whether political in Hazard or economic in Silicon Valley), it would be foolhardy to suggest that Trump cannot win. He can; and he can in part because of the liberal intellectual arrogance that dismisses the economic, social and cultural problems his rise has underscored. Whatever happens in November, these problems will persist, and it will take major public and private investment and an unlikely rebirth of bipartisanship in Washington to make any dent in them. Back in Paris -- the Kentucky one -- I sit down in a coffee shop with Cindy Hedges and her husband, Mitch. He worked for more than 30 years as a welder and then a supervisor in a factory that refurbished mining equipment. It was dirty work -- coal is black, grease is black, hydraulic oil is black -- but it was a good living. He lost his job in February, before returning on a temporary contract a couple of weeks ago, and when I ask him why his full-time employment disappeared, the answer is by now familiar: the E.P.A. and Obama, for whom, like his wife, he voted in 2008. But when I turn to this political season, he springs a surprise. ""Look, there's nobody to vote for,"" he says. ""Trump is an idiot, he pisses everyone off, he's scary, he'll pump his mouth off to some foreign country and we'll be at war. He's a billionaire on a power trip with as much reason to be president as I have. If Trump had shut up, he'd win the election. So do you vote for the one who's going to lie, or the one who takes you to war? I'm leaning Hillary."" ""Oh, come on, Mitch!"" says Cindy. ""What? With Bill Clinton the economy was rolling. I was working a 50-hour week and my 401 (k) outperformed my salary. He's going to be advising Hillary, suggesting she needs to do this or this."" ""They don't get along, Mitch."" ""Well, I'm scared of Trump."" ""I guess we'll cancel each other out then,"" says Cindy. At the boot store, Carrie McCall, a FedEx driver, appears with a package. ""I love Trump,"" she declares. ""He shoots from the hip."" But, I ask, isn't that dangerous? ""I don't care. After all we've been through, I just don't care.""

3598,1449755777.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  When President Obama travels abroad, his staff packs briefing books, gifts for foreign leaders and something more closely associated with camping than diplomacy: a tent. Even when Mr. Obama travels to allied nations, aides quickly set up the security tent -- which has opaque sides and noise-making devices inside -- in a room near his hotel suite. When the president needs to read a classified document or have a sensitive conversation, he ducks into the tent to shield himself from secret video cameras and listening devices. American security officials demand that their bosses -- not just the president, but members of Congress, diplomats, policy makers and military officers -- take such precautions when traveling abroad because it is widely acknowledged that their hosts often have no qualms about snooping on their guests. The United States has come under withering criticism in recent weeks about revelations that the National Security Agency listened in on allied leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. A panel created by Mr. Obama in August to review that practice, among other things, is scheduled to submit a preliminary report this week and a final report by the middle of next month. But American officials assume -- and can cite evidence -- that they get the same treatment when they travel abroad, even from European Union allies. ""No matter where you are, we are a target these days,"" said R. James Woolsey Jr., the director of central intelligence during the Clinton administration. ""No matter where we go, countries like China, Russia and much of the Arab world have assets and are trying to spy on us so you have to think about that and take as many precautions as possible.""  On a trip to Latin America in 2011, for example, a White House photo showed Mr. Obama talking from a security tent in a Rio de Janeiro hotel suite with Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, and Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary at the time, about the air war against Libya that had been launched the previous day. Another photo, taken three days later in San Salvador, showed him conferring from the tent with advisers about the attack. Spokesmen for the State Department, the C.I.A. and the National Security Council declined to provide details on the measures the government takes to protect officials overseas. But more than a dozen current and former government officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, described in interviews some of those measures.  They range from instructing officials traveling overseas to assume every utterance and move is under surveillance and requiring them to scrub their cellphones for listening devices after they have visited government offices, to equipping the president's limousine, which always travels with him, to keep private conversations private. Mr. Obama carries a specially encrypted BlackBerry; one member of his cabinet was told he could not take his iPad on an overseas trip because it was not considered a secure device. Countermeasures are taken on American soil as well. When cabinet secretaries and top national security officials take up their new jobs, the government retrofits their homes with special secure rooms for top-secret conversations and computer use. In accordance with a several-hundred-page classified manual, the rooms are lined with foil and soundproofed. An interior location, preferably with no windows, is recommended. One of the most recent recipients: James B. Comey, the new director of the F.B.I., whose homes in the Washington area and New England were retrofitted.  During the Cold War, a former senior official said, listening devices were found embedded in the walls and light fixtures of the hotels where American diplomats stayed. These days, the official said, American analysts worry more about eavesdropping radio signals beamed toward hotel rooms in the hopes of picking up officials' conversations.  ""We took it for granted that in some of these hotels, no matter the state, that devices were built in there,"" the official said. It is not exactly clear when American officials began using the tents while traveling. According to several former senior law enforcement and intelligence officials, George J. Tenet, the director of the C.I.A. from 1997 to 2004, was one of the first officials to use one regularly. ""Clinton and the White House were using him as an emissary in the Middle East with Arafat, and he was always over there and in Israel and needed to have something secure to read and talk,"" said a former senior intelligence official who worked directly with Mr. Tenet. ""He started using it and just continued through the rest of his tenure."" The official said that the C.I.A. was particularly insistent that Mr. Tenet use the tent in Israel because it has some of the most sophisticated spying software. ""We would get especially concerned when our Israeli hosts wanted to reserve the hotel rooms for us at the King David,"" the official said, referring to a famous hotel in Jerusalem. Mr. Woolsey, an executive now at the consulting firm Opportunities Development Group in Washington, said that when he traveled abroad as the nation's top intelligence official from 1993 to 1995, he had only encrypted phones. ""We were so far ahead of the rest of the world at that point technologically,"" Mr. Woolsey said. ""But by the time Tenet came along in the late '90s, they started to get worried about China, and things were changing."" Before the security tents are set up, hotel rooms are checked for bugs and radio waves. A former senior government official who read classified documents in the small tents said that they were far less attractive than the sleek ones that sleep six and are sold at camping stores like REI.  ""I felt like I was in the middle of the big woods, but I was in the middle of a hotel room,"" said the former official.  Many of the measures taken for travel are for only the most senior officials because they are costly and cumbersome. Instead of the tent, less senior officials can end up using smaller structures that look like telephone booths. But all officials traveling in this age of high surveillance are given one basic marching order: Use common sense. ""You follow procedures about what to do and what not to do,"" said William J. Lynn III, a former deputy defense secretary under Mr. Obama. ""It wasn't like I had to make calls in the shower."" Official American visitors to Russia and China are warned that they should never retrieve or discuss sensitive or classified information outside the embassy. In recent years, many private companies have gone further, instituting policies that forbid employees to take their cellphones to Russia and China. But even outside countries with histories of spying on Americans, diplomats say, they are resigned to the fact that no electronic message sent or received is ever really private anymore. ""We do operate with the awareness that anything we do on a cellphone or BlackBerry is probably being read by someone somewhere, or lots of someones,"" said a senior American diplomat. Even with rigorous security protocols drilled into their heads by their superiors -- like rules barring some White House and National Security Council staff members from gaining access to social media on their computers and phones out of fear of downloading malware -- officials say it is hard to police every utterance on a mobile device. ""Given the press of events and the ubiquity of cellphones,"" said one former American diplomat with experience in the Middle East, ""it is in practice very difficult to constantly self-edit conversations to ensure that you don't stray into classified information.""

2639,1848770957.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. They keep coming, both the bombs and the images from Aleppo, so many of them, the munitions raining indiscriminately on trapped families, aid workers and children. The Russian and Syrian government forces wouldn't let them leave. But the photographs and videos have made it out. The faces of the besieged, staring into the camera, at us, and at death, pleading for help, baffled by our indifference to the slaughter, describing the atrocities outside their bedrooms or just on the other side of the door. We see their faces from an angle we ordinarily see a friend's face, up close, staring straight into our eyes. They are bearing witness, in real time, refusing to disappear without a trace. And in this era of connectedness, they are refusing to let us off the hook. These images, spread via social media, unmediated, confirm that the people making them are still alive -- in that moment, anyway. We have never before received such a deluge of images from any front, never gotten such an intimate, minute-by-minute, look at what the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said on Wednesday most likely constituted war crimes. ""Please, save us, thank you,"" says Bana al-Abed, a 7-year-old Syrian girl, in one video posted to Twitter. Bana has been tweeting for a few months with her mother from eastern Aleppo, where Syrian government and Russian forces bombed her family out of their home. This week she said she knew she was going to die. It is hard for me to imagine anyone watching the video without feeling intense horror and shame. Bana's feed has prompted Western news outlets to fiddle over whether her tweets and videos are propaganda, whether Bana or her location can be authenticated. And Aleppo continues to burn. ""When a free-trade agreement with the U.S.A. drives hundreds of thousands of people to the streets, but such horrible bombings as in Aleppo do not trigger any protest, then something is not right,"" said Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel. No, not right. Pictures of war and suffering have pricked the public conscience and provoked action before. There was Kevin Carter's photograph from 1993 of a starving toddler and a vulture in Sudan. There was the photograph of the dead American soldier dragged through Mogadishu, which hastened the United States' retreat from Somalia. There was Nick Ut's 1972 photograph from South Vietnam of the naked 9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc, screaming, burned by napalm. These pictures drove news cycles for weeks, months, years, helping tip the scales of policy. To be sure, the policy response was usually withdrawal. What might be done in a situation like Aleppo is not so linear. But that isn't the whole story. Does it matter that victims in Syria are Muslims? America's president-elect won the election while playing to anti-Muslim bigotry. He sold himself to the American public as a transactional leader, promising deals, not necessarily decency. He said he admired Russia's strongman president, Vladimir V. Putin, and campaigned on an isolationist retreat from global involvement. We each turn to the news we like. During the Vietnam War, Americans watched the same network broadcasts and thumbed through the same magazine photographs. There was a draft. The war was in everyone's home. Today a tiny percentage of Americans fight our battles. We watch desperate young strangers from faraway Aleppo from the comfort of a Facebook feed. The images and voices start to blur together. A tweet by President-elect Donald J. Trump or some scandal over fake news distracts us. Briefly, we have mourned on a significant scale two photographs, the ones of Alan Kurdi, the dead 2-year-old washed up on the beach in Turkey, and of Omran Daqneesh, 5, pulled from the ashes of Aleppo, sitting in the ambulance, wiping blood from his face. We also paused over drone footage from a neighborhood in Aleppo pulverized by the Syrian government and Russia. Then those images dropped down the collective memory hole, too. That's because all images are Rorschach tests. Half a million people have been killed in Aleppo, millions displaced across Syria. Syrian, Iranian and Russian forces have laid waste to half the country, instigating a refugee crisis that threatens to unmake Europe and America. But Washington shrugs. There have been no sanctions as there were over Russia's annexation of Crimea. There turned out to be no red lines, even after chemical weapons killed and maimed hundreds, no marches on the Mall or big campus rallies. Russia and Syria bomb civilians with impunity. And all we do is watch, helplessly, as Syrians refuse to go quietly, determined to get us to know them, their lives, all that has been lost. Some of the public's indifference can of course be chalked up to compassion fatigue and disillusionment with a war in its sixth year. Promises to end the conflict were broken over and over. There were assurances about popular uprisings. Social media today supercharges protest movements, which burn out almost as fast. Such movements used to require a slow, brick-by-brick construction. They didn't rely on Facebook videos and Instagram photos. Truth be told, no sane person wants to see these images anyway. What's happening in Aleppo is almost unbearable to look at. But that's the point. Bana looks us straight in the eye and asks us to save her, please. We have done nothing to help. The very least we should do is look back. Correction:  December 17, 2016, Saturday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Critic's Notebook article on Thursday about the failure, with few exceptions, of pictures and videos of suffering in the Syrian war to provoke much action overstated the death toll in Aleppo, the commercial capital of Syria, which fell to the government this week. While precise numbers are unavailable, tens of thousands have been killed in Aleppo -- not ""half a million,"" which is the estimated death toll for all of Syria since the war began.

316,1017924665.xml,"      FRANKFURT - Josef Ackermann bowed out Thursday as the chief executive of Deutsche Bank after more than a decade in which he transformed the institution into a global contender but also became a symbol to many Germans of the excesses of capitalism.   At the bank's annual meeting, Mr. Ackermann passed his responsibilities to two subordinates who will run the bank in tandem. Anshu Jain, a native of India who has been in charge of Deutsche Bank's investment banking operations, will serve as co-chief executive with Jurgen Fitschen, a German whose title is head of Deutsche Bank regional management.   Mr. Ackermann's tendency to draw accolades and catcalls was on view during his appearance, expected to be his last, before shareholders in an arena often used for rock concerts. Among a crowd of about 7,000 - a record for the company's meetings - there were some boos and shouted insults as Mr. Ackermann reviewed the bank's achievements in the last decade. But at the end of his speech shareholders gave him a standing ovation.   Under Mr. Ackermann, the stock has ridden a roller coaster, peaking above 100 euros, or $124, in 2007 but falling below 20 euros in 2009. On Thursday, the shares closed at 29.09 euros on the DAX index.   ""I have done my duty and served the company with all my strength,"" said Mr. Ackermann, who is retiring, at age 64, having stayed longer than initially planned.   Mr. Ackermann, a Swiss citizen who joined Deutsche Bank from Credit Suisse in 1996 and became chief executive in 2002, made Deutsche Bank a force in international banking while also becoming an influential figure in political circles. Since the financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt debacle weakened other German banks, Deutsche Bank remains the country's only institution able to compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase.   But there were hints Thursday of the succession struggle that marred Mr. Ackermann's final years at the bank and helped derail plans for him to become chairman of the supervisory board, a part-time oversight role that many of his predecessors have held. During a speech to shareholders, Mr. Ackermann made only the briefest mention of his successors, Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen, saying they ""can build on what we have achieved together.""   The investment banking business run by Mr. Jain, 49, has often been responsible for most of Deutsche Bank's profit, which last year was 4.3 billion euros. But some critics have questioned putting an investment banker at the head of the institution when risk-taking by traders is under fire, and when Deutsche Bank is trying to re-emphasize traditional businesses like retail banking.   Mr. Fitschen is seen as a transitional figure who will help compensate for Mr. Jain's lack of fluency in German and maintain the bank's close ties to political leaders in Europe. At 63, Mr. Fitschen is just a few months younger than Mr. Ackermann.   While Deutsche Bank earned most of its 33 billion euros of revenue last year outside Germany, many Germans regard the bank as de facto common property, although the government has no stake - ""half a bank and half a part of Germany,"" as the newspaper Handelsblatt wrote recently.   As usual, the annual meeting was a mass event with thousands of shareholders converging on a Frankfurt arena that in a few weeks will be used for a concert by the American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West. The shareholders lined up for wurst and potato salad at buffet tables, and there was even a place where they could have souvenir photos taken.   Leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, or Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank until last year, sought Mr. Ackermann's views, particularly after the financial crisis exploded in 2008. He was also an advocate for banking interests as president of the Institute of International Finance, an industry group whose membership includes most large American banks.   But Mr. Ackermann has drawn his share of controversy. His salary of 6.3 million euros in 2011 was not outlandish compared with those of the leaders of other big banks. But in some years he has been the highest-paid chief executive in Germany, becoming to some a symbol of corporate greed.   Deutsche Bank has also come under fire for what some critics regard as an unusually high number of lawsuits by aggrieved customers or official investigations. In early May, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay the United States government more than $200 million to settle accusations that it had knowingly misled the Department of Housing and Urban Development about the quality of mortgages that later defaulted.   ""We are concerned about the number of litigations and investigations which have mounted in the last few years,"" said Hans-Christoph Hirt, global head of corporate engagement at Hermes Equity Ownership Services, a unit of Hermes Fund Managers that represents several large Deutsche Bank shareholders.   ""This doesn't look good and raises concerns about how new business opportunities and business activities are assessed before they are entered into,"" Mr. Hirt said.   Mr. Ackermann acknowledged that the bank had made mistakes. ""No business can be worth risking the bank's reputation and credibility,"" he said. ""From today's perspective, and I underline today's perspective, we did not always completely live up to this principle during the years of excessive exuberance prior to the financial crisis.""   Mr. Hirt also criticized what he said was weak oversight by the bank's supervisory board, which he blamed for an unseemly public battle over who would succeed Mr. Ackermann.   Clemens Borsig ceded his seat as chairman of the supervisory board Thursday, resigning amid criticism of the way he had handled the selection of Mr. Ackermann's successor. And he had warred openly with Mr. Ackermann.   But the two men shook hands warmly on stage at the annual meeting. ""Contrary to press reports, we always worked together in a collegial spirit in the interests of the bank,"" Mr. Ackermann said.   The relationship between Mr. Ackermann and Mr. Jain, his onetime protege, also seemed to cool in recent years. During his speech to shareholders, Mr. Ackermann lavished praise on two top executives, Hugo Banziger and Hermann-Josef Lamberti, who are leaving to make way for managers close to Mr. Jain.   Mr. Borsig will be replaced by Paul Achleitner, former head of Goldman Sachs in Germany and until this week chief financial officer of Allianz, a Munich insurance company.   While there is a tradition among Deutsche Bank chief executives of taking over the supervisory board after they retire, some investors objected to Mr. Ackermann's assuming that role, fearing he might impede his successor. So Mr. Ackermann chose not to seek the post rather than face possible opposition in the annual meeting.   Mr. Achleitner, who at 55 is young to head the supervisory board of a large German company, is expected to be an activist chairman. That could create friction with Mr. Jain. But Mr. Hirt said he welcomed Mr. Achleitner's influence.   The supervisory board, Mr. Hirt said, should ""think a little about the culture and think about the reasons for all the litigation and investigations."" He added, ""That's really an area we would like them to focus on.""   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2446,1716196687.xml,"       UNITED NATIONS --  It will be the largest gathering of presidents and prime ministers ever at the United Nations. Some of them will assemble here under one roof for the first time in years, and their job will be to wrestle with global crises that they stubbornly disagree on, including climate change, the war in Syria, and a historic exodus of people fleeing conflict and hunger. But even before they start lecturing one another at the United Nations General Assembly this week, the leaders will come in for a heavy dose of moral flogging by an enormously popular leader known for taking swings at the global elite: Pope Francis. This is the first time a pope will address such a large gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, according to Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. Francis speaks in the General Assembly on Friday morning, before the official start of a global summit meeting where an ambitious set of development goals are to be adopted, including reducing economic inequality and offering good schools for all. Lifting up the poor is a signature issue for Francis. Yet, he could give world leaders a tongue lashing for ravaging the environment, failing to protect people from mass atrocities and rejecting refugees who show up at their borders. All are transnational challenges that defy easy answers. In a way, some argue, only a figure of the pope's stature has the global popularity and moral authority (though no enforcement powers) to make the world powers take heed. ""Governments and their leaders are not easily swayed by moral appeals, even from the pope, but they do respond to their public opinion,"" said Louise Fréchette, a former deputy secretary general of the United Nations. She added that the pope's emphasis on issues like climate change and refugees could put pressure on governments to act. It is also a boon for the United Nations. ""His presence,"" Ms. Fréchette said, ""underlines the continued centrality of the institution."" The secretary general certainly seemed to be looking to Francis for support nudging the 193 nations that make up the organization. ""We expect that he will send his spiritual guidance to all the member states of the United Nations,"" Mr. Ban said, a bit wistfully, at a recent news conference. ""I really count on his leadership."" More than 150 presidents and prime ministers are scheduled to follow Francis at the development summit meeting that starts Friday. Then, on Monday, world leaders are scheduled to begin the annual debate, approaching the podium one by one under the illuminated dome of the General Assembly hall, to advance their agendas and, inevitably, take swipes at their rivals. The two sessions, which United Nations officials call historic, feature an all-star lineup of autocrats, princes and populists, some of whom rarely show up at the General Assembly. It will be the first visit by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in seven years and Xi Jinping's first as president of China. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was last here a decade ago. His speech, scheduled for Monday morning, shortly after President Obama's, will be among the most closely watched. The General Assembly conclave will produce the first meeting of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama in nearly a year. The Russian envoy to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, would say only that he hoped frayed relations between the two countries would improve. ""I don't think it's a second Cold War. But it's very uncomfortable,"" he said in a recent interview. Syria will be front and center in this year's deliberations. Russia and the United States are planning to host rival sessions, one in the General Assembly and one in the Security Council, on countering terrorist groups in the Middle East. The foreign ministers of all five permanent members of the Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- will also discuss Syria at a lunch hosted by Mr. Ban. Those meetings come at a pivotal moment in the Syrian conflict, as Russia sends more men and matériel to aid Mr. Assad's government, prompting American officials to open up military-to-military talks with the Russians. British and American jets have conducted airstrikes on what they call Islamic State positions. France has announced that it will begin airstrikes soon. The flurry of diplomacy may simply highlight the failure to prevent ""the scourge of war,"" as the United Nations Charter set out as its principal goal 70 years ago. Beyond Syria, the conflicts in Darfur, in western Sudan, and in Yemen and Libya continue, often with the involvement of regional and world powers. ""Everybody is saying, 'Somebody else has to do something.' No one is saying, 'What can we do?' "" Gerard van Bohemen, the permanent representative of New Zealand, one of the rotating members of the Security Council, said this month. At the General Assembly podium, the remarks of Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, will be closely dissected in Iran and elsewhere for signs of how Iran's relationship with the outside world will change in the wake of the nuclear deal with six global powers. The influential Saudi foreign minister, Prince Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir, will speak as his country continues its military campaign against Houthi insurgents in Yemen. The Hungarian president will attend amid broad criticism for putting up barriers to refugees crossing Europe. President Raúl Castro of Cuba will come for the first time in decades, on the heels of a historic thaw with the United States. And amid all this, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, will hoist the Palestinian flag for the first time at the United Nations. All told, at least 12,000 people are expected in New York for the assembly. Here is what to expect on the three top issues. First, with a deadline approaching for a global climate accord, there will be a great deal of attention on how national leaders pledge in the coming days to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. While major polluters like China, the United States and the European Union have announced their plans, other big nations -- including Brazil and India -- have not. Second, with bitter disagreement on what to do about the exodus of refugees and displaced people worldwide, the foreign ministers of the seven richest nations -- the Group of 7, as they are known -- will meet on Tuesday. The secretary general is also leading a General Assembly meeting on how to address the refugee crisis in Europe, though he is unlikely to propose any specific solution. European leaders had hoped for a small victory before their top leaders arrived, but that now seems elusive: a Security Council resolution to authorize their soldiers to inspect and seize vessels suspected in human smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea. That measure is facing pushback from African leaders who object to authorizing military action. And then there is Syria. The Islamic State has spread swiftly across the country since world leaders gathered here last year for their annual conclave. Russian and Western diplomats have continued to snipe at one another over who is more to blame for the chaos there -- the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, or the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. The Western position on Mr. Assad's future has clearly shifted since last year. The United States and its allies have dropped their public calls for his immediate ouster, saying only that Mr. Assad should step down by the end of a transitional political process. ""We all have to be creative in overcoming this divide,"" one Security Council diplomat said this week, adding that even Mr. Assad's most vociferous Western critics wanted to avoid a wholesale purge of his government. It would suffice, the diplomat said, if ""tens, not hundreds,"" were to be removed. The person asked not to be named because of the delicacy of diplomatic negotiations. Russia welcomes the fact that American airstrikes have avoided the Assad government's positions on the battlefield. ""To me it's absolutely clear that one of the very serious concerns of American government is that Assad regime will fall and ISIL will take over Damascus and the United States will be blamed for that,"" said Mr. Churkin, the Russian envoy. Meanwhile, the war grinds into its fifth year, having killed a quarter million people and uprooted 11 million from their homes. A Security Officer This Week at the United Nations.

2428,1825158724.xml,"       BUDAPEST -- Hungarians handed the country's autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, a partial victory on Sunday by overwhelmingly voting ""no"" in a national referendum on whether to accept more migrants, but without giving him the turnout for a valid result. What Mr. Orban intends to do now, however, remains a mystery. The referendum -- on which the government spent at least 10 billion Hungarian forint, or about $36 million -- included no specifics about legislation or government action. ""What will happen after the referendum will depend partly on the results themselves, but also on what is happening on the international scene,"" said Zoltan Kovacs, Mr. Orban's chief international spokesman, who declined to provide any more details. With 99 percent of the vote counted Sunday night, 98 percent of voters had chosen to refuse to allow the European Union to force the country to accept refugees. But the turnout was 40 percent, well below the 50 percent required for a referendum to be considered valid under Hungarian law. Despite the failure to meet the turnout threshold, Mr. Orban said he considered the vote a mandate for the government to pursue its anti-immigrant policies. ""We can be proud to be the first E.U. state to let its people express their own views on the issue of immigration,"" Mr. Orban said in a speech at his victory party on Sunday night. ""We are facing the most important question for years to come: It's about the future of Hungary, with whom we live, what will be our culture, our lifestyle and our Christian roots."" In 2015, Mr. Orban made a name for himself by building a heavily guarded, razor-wire fence across the country's southern borders to stem the flood of migrants into Hungary. He is the leader of one of a growing number of nationalistic, right-wing parties spreading across Europe, fueled by fear of migrants and resentment about the centralization of the European Union's power. Leaders across the Continent were closely watching the outcome of the vote and what actions Mr. Orban would take afterward. Poland's foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, recently echoed Mr. Orban's call for restructuring the European Union to return more power to individual nations. ""Our proposals are quite radical,"" Mr. Waszczykowski said. The Czech Parliament has also discussed proposals to emulate Hungary by building border fences and beefing up border security. In Austria, a right-wing candidate has a solid chance of becoming the next president. And support for nationalist parties is surging in France and Denmark. ""Far-right movements are on the rise everywhere, and there are reasons for that,"" said Gabor Fodor, the head of the Hungarian Liberal Party. ""The E.U. is very slow. Look at the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent euro crisis and now the refugee crisis. People can feel it. There is nothing happening."" Further fueling populist leaders, Mr. Fodor said, is the reality that Europe's economy is less robust than it was in the 1990s. ""The middle class doesn't have as much. The economy is not as strong,"" Mr. Fodor said. ""The welfare state is on the way down, and this has an impact on people's lives."" Even Europe's most powerful leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, is in real danger of falling to this nationalist tide in next year's elections. ""We are in the midst of a backlash against globalization, and it is a widespread phenomenon,"" said Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels. ""The general perception is that things have spiraled out of control. There is an increasing resistance to international business agreements. And this phenomenon has led to renationalization of individual states and rediscovery of national identity."" Marta Pardavi, a chairwoman of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a refugee rights group, said Mr. Orban insisted that ""he needs the demonstrated support of the Hungarian people in the referendum so he can take courageous and bold steps."" But Mr. Orban has not been specific about what those steps will be. Instead, rumors swirl: There is talk of an amendment to Hungary's Constitution preventing the European Union from imposing rules on the country without the approval of the Parliament. Some say Mr. Orban is likely to hold early elections to take advantage of the referendum's momentum. Mr. Orban wants more autonomy from the European Union, but he also does not want to threaten the flow of desperately needed aid from the bloc's headquarters in Brussels. Whether Mr. Orban will storm up the Danube and lay siege to Brussels, or whether this was just a very expensive exercise in rallying domestic support, is the subject of much debate here. ""Most of the effort, I would say, is for domestic political purposes,"" said Csaba Toth, the director of strategy for the Republikon Institute, a research and advocacy group that has been critical of the government. ""Whenever the migration issue is on the table, the government's popularity goes up. When something else is on the agenda, the government's popularity goes down."" But as the flow of migrants into Hungary has slowed in recent months -- largely because of Mr. Orban's border fence -- the issue has slipped from public consciousness. ""Last year, it was easy to keep the migration issue on the agenda,"" Mr. Toth said. ""We had a real refugee crisis. It was evident everywhere. Now, we don't, so they have to make it a political initiative to keep the migration issue in the public's mind."" Mr. Orban was aided by a lack of unity among the opposition, mainly because there is little popular support anywhere for admitting more migrants. Most left-wing parties had urged their supporters to stay home on Sunday, hoping to deny Mr. Orban the turnout he needed for a valid vote -- although there remained questions about what that meant for a referendum that demanded no specific actions by the government other than opposing European Union refugee policies. ""When a question doesn't make sense, why take part?"" Timea Szabo, a chairwoman of the left-wing Dialogue for Hungary Party, said before Sunday's voting. ""Orban is purposely misleading the Hungarian people in a villainous way. All of this focus on migrants takes attention away from government corruption cases, the terrible state of public health and education."" In failing to meet the legal threshold, Mr. Orban's government found itself hoisted by its own petard. In 2011, the government raised the level of voter turnout necessary for a referendum to be considered valid to 50 percent, from 25 percent. Critics said the move was intended to stifle popular efforts to overturn Mr. Orban's policies. The prankster Two-Tailed Dog Party, which has fought the government with irreverent humor, had urged people to purposely cast an invalid ballot, which, in sufficient numbers, they hoped would deny the government its 50 percent threshold. Voting on Sunday morning in Budapest, Mr. Orban said that while a valid result was certainly better than an invalid one, there would be ""legal consequences"" in either event, as long as there were more ""no"" votes than ""yes"" votes. ""According to us, only the Hungarian Parliament can decide with whom Hungarians want to live,"" he said. ""We will make sure this is enshrined in our legal system if it is valid or invalid."" Jobbik, a far-right party, had reluctantly urged its members to support the government and vote ""no."" Only Mr. Fodor's tiny Liberal Party urged citizens to vote ""yes,"" arguing that the referendum should be seen as a measure of support for the European Union.

3847,2244494612.xml,"BRUSSELS -- On the menu was a starter of green asparagus and smoked salmon, with a main course of European discord.After a two-day meeting in Brussels, European Union leaders said on Friday that they had failed to agree on who will lead the bloc's key institutions -- first and foremost the European Commission, the administrative branch -- for the next five years.In typical European Union style, as the leaders squabbled over dinner on Thursday in a room with jammed cellphone signal and few aides, they even disagreed on the process they would follow to reach a decision.They said they would meet again on June 30 to give it another go.The tussle over this esoteric but important choice of personnel to lead the institutions that make the bloc work -- including the critically important European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 member states that use the euro -- is emblematic of the political disharmony at the heart of the world's richest group of nations.""It's part and parcel of the process we need to pursue,"" the bloc's most powerful leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, told reporters on Friday.The optimism she expressed that the leaders would reach an agreement at their next meeting reflected what many in Brussels instinctively know: That for the European Union to forge a common position on most matters, its member states first need to go through iterations of disagreeing.This choreography is playing out against a pressing existential struggle: How to inject more democratic accountability and transparency into the business of governing a bloc that is increasingly important in the lives of more than half a billion citizens in 28 countries, but whose institutions remain largely opaque to those they serve.[The E.U. is choosing its four presidents. What do they all do, and why does it matter?]Momentous changes across the European Union can be attributed to this tension, in particular Brexit and the rise of populism, both in sharp focus after last month's European Parliament elections.The Parliament, the European Union's only directly elected institution, is now more fragmented than ever, with the center of the traditional political spectrum -- the conservatives and the socialists -- weakened so significantly that they can no longer promote their own candidates to the bloc's top jobs.In 2014, when major institutions' positions were last filled, the European Union conducted an experiment to select the European Commission president that it hoped would better link the bloc's top official to the people's will.Under that plan, the Commission's chief would be the anointed candidate of the political grouping with the most seats in the European Parliament. Luxembourg's former prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, a veteran conservative politician, took the post.Critics say this was a flawed and premature way of arriving at the appointment. The accountability link between the candidate and the electorate was not clear, they say, and gave too much power to the European Parliament and too little to the national, elected governments of member states.""The processes were pretty transparent, sometimes I think too transparent to be productive,"" said the European Council's president, Donald Tusk, whose job is also up for grabs and is effectively to convene meetings of the bloc's leaders, set their agenda and try to hammer out compromises on the issues of the day.This time around, that process appears dead in the water, as none of the three candidates can command a majority in the Parliament, whose consent is needed to bless the appointment. Next week's meeting seems set to be conducted purely on the basis of political horse trading.The risk is that reconciling the demand among European leaders to give power to officials from different geographical regions, political ideologies and gender could lead to a bad outcome for actually doing the jobs at hand.""You could eventually end up with someone not ambitious enough, because if you want to satisfy everyone, you might be looking at the lowest common denominator,"" said Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, a research institute in Brussels.This could lead to further trouble down the road.""Many Europeans who went to the polls last month actively voted for change, and punished the center right and center left for muddling through, failing to come up with more bold actions on Europe's pressing challenges,"" Ms. Gostynska-Jakubowska said.""If we end up with someone who's not embracing this call for change,"" she said, ""there could be a bigger backlash the next time around.""Credit: By MATINA STEVIS-GRIDNEFF; Stephen Castle and Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany arriving at the European gathering on Friday.

127,1804826144.xml,"       BERLIN -- The devastating attack in Nice, carried out by a Tunisian man living in France, came at a moment of political ferment in Europe and seems likely to give even more fuel to anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim movements that are challenging established parties across the region. The third major attack in France in 17 months -- a murderous truck ride by a disturbed  loner claimed by the Islamic State as a ""soldier"" in its war on the West -- was used by far-right movements and anti-immigration, populist parties within the political mainstream as fodder for their arguments that Islam poses a mortal danger to European societies. Curbing immigration, a rallying call for Britons who voted last month to leave the European Union, as well as for many supporters of Donald J. Trump in the United States, is the answer, they suggested. ""This is a war,"" Geert Wilders, the Dutch right-winger who is gaining in his country's polls, said on Twitter on Friday. ""And it will not stop until we close our borders for Islam and de-Islamize our societies. No more terror. No more Islam!"" In France, next year's presidential contest is already in full swing. The unpopular incumbent, François Hollande, a Socialist, is facing intensifying questions about his handling of the nation's security and electoral challenges from both the center-right and the far-right National Front. On Friday, the leader of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, said Mr. Hollande had done ""absolutely nothing"" of substance to protect France from Islamic terrorism. Germany and Austria both have elections coming that will test the strength of anti-immigrant parties. Right-leaning populism has also picked up strength across much of Central and Eastern Europe, especially since a migrant crisis last year brought more than a million asylum seekers to the Continent. In all of those places, the Nice attack quickly rippled through the political discourse. ""This was in one of the most famous holiday destinations in Europe, and the images were so horrific that it does feed into this general sense of insecurity that populist parties trade off,"" said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute. ""It adds to the idea that the established parties are not in control and that we are under threat,"" Mr. Leonard added. ""It adds, too, to this general sense that rather than transforming the world around us, Europe is being transformed by globalization, and by people coming in and posing a threat."" A recent survey from the Pew Research Center showed that the refugee crisis and the threat of terrorism were becoming intertwined in the minds of many Europeans. In eight of the 10 European nations covered, more than half of those surveyed said they believed that the presence of refugees -- mostly from Syria, Iraq and other poor and war-torn Muslim nations -- increased the likelihood of terrorism in their country. Fears were highest in Hungary and Poland. In Poland, the right-wing government is already locked in bitter disputes with the European Union over freedom of speech and the rule of law. As the grisly details in Nice became clear, Poland's interior minister swiftly blamed ""decades of multi-culti policy"" and those ""who lit up the Eiffel Tower"" after earlier attacks in Paris. ""They haven't learned anything from terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, when those in power just burst into tears,"" the minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, told Polsat News, a private TV channel. ""We need to focus on guaranteeing people's safety."" That is best done, he argued, by emulating Poland and Hungary, keeping migrants out and preventing crime. ""We, unlike Western Europe, don't experience such problems; we don't have districts ruled by a different law than Polish law; we don't have no-go zones that Polish police cannot enter,"" Mr. Blaszczak said, alluding to debunked reports of such areas in Western Europe. Pawel Kukiz, leader of the self-described patriotic opposition party Kukiz'15, which won seats in Parliament last fall, used the Nice attack to call for a referendum asking Poles whether they agree to accept any refugees. Hungary was already due to hold a similar plebiscite in the fall, and Prime Minister Victor Orban -- the first European leader to build fences last year to keep out waves of Middle East migrants -- is urging Hungarians to vote against European quotas for taking in newcomers. That vote is scheduled for Oct. 2, the same day that neighboring Austria will hold a rerun of its presidential election. That contest pits a former Green Party leader against a far-right politician, Norbert Hofer, who could become the first rightist elected head of state in Europe since 1945. Even if Mr. Hofer does not prevail, his Freedom party is still No. 1 in opinion polls in Austria, well ahead of the mainstream parties that have governed Austria since 1945 but were eliminated in the first round of presidential voting in April. Even in prosperous and conservative Germany, Europe's No. 1 power, politics have become more fractured. The far-right Alternative for Germany, mired in internal disputes, has slipped to between 9 percent and 12 percent in opinion polls, down from 15 percent. But that is still well above the 5 percent barrier for winning seats in next year's national elections. Support for Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative bloc has strengthened slightly since the British referendum, as the public saw the economic and political aftermath of that vote. But Ms. Merkel is still widely blamed for a policy that allowed some one million migrants to arrive in Germany last year. Desperate to stanch the flow, she enlisted Turkey to help keep migrants from entering Europe. How that agreement will fare now that Turkey's military has tried to unseat President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was one of many open questions. In Britain, one of the biggest challenges facing Prime Minister Theresa May's new government is how to balance a desire for continued access to the European single market with the European Union's requirement of open-border policies that allow European citizens to live and work anywhere they please within the bloc. Shutting off immigration was one of the most powerful motives behind the vote to leave the European Union, and the attack in Nice seemed likely to harden the position of those advocating strict border control. Well before the British referendum, the refugee crisis had put an acute strain on European unity, and in particular on Europe's Schengen border-free travel zone. The attacker in Nice was living in France legally. But the assault followed other terror attacks in which some attackers had crossed the Belgian-French border, and two of the attackers in the assault on Paris in November had apparently entered Europe in last year's migrant wave. As a result, criticisms of Europe's open-border policies have taken root not just on the far right but among more mainstream parties. ""All the Schengen countries have now free circulation of people,"" Pierre Lellouche, a former minister and member of France's center-right Republican party, told the BBC on Friday. ""But it is turning into free circulation of terrorists. We don't know who enters."" As for improving border control or sharing more information among European intelligence agencies, he added: ""Nothing is happening.""

3921,1921361959.xml,"FRANKFURT -- A dispute between Berlin and Moscow escalated on Friday after Siemens, the German industrial giant, said it would stop delivering power plant equipment to Russia after gas turbines were moved to the disputed territory of Crimea against the company's wishes.Siemens also acted to cut ties with a Russian partner, a further sign of deteriorating trade relations with Russia, once seen as a promising market for German cars, machinery and other goods.The company's decision to stop deliveries of gas turbines, at least temporarily, comes less than two weeks after it complained that a Russian customer had shipped electrical generation machinery to Crimea instead of its intended destination in southern Russia. The relocation of the turbines defied a contractual agreement not to violate international sanctions, Siemens said.On Friday, the German company said four gas turbines sold to Technopromexport had been illegally moved to Crimea, twice as many as previously known. ""This development constitutes a blatant breach of Siemens' delivery contracts, trust and E.U. regulations,"" the company said in a statement.The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, had said that the turbines moved to Crimea were made in Russia from Russian parts, and so were not subject to sanctions restrictions. Siemens has disputed that interpretation, saying the equipment was by contract subject to the sanctions.Crimea has been starved for power since Russia annexed the territory in 2014, interrupting the flow of electricity from Ukraine. The situation has become desperate enough that President Vladimir V. Putin's government, which owns Technopromexport, was willing to risk further alienating Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Siemens said it would impose a moratorium on deliveries of power plant equipment to state-controlled firms in Russia ""for the time being."" A company spokesman said he could not provide information on how many existing orders would be affected, or how many sales it stood to lose.In the future, Siemens said, it would deliver only equipment that its workers installed themselves, to ensure there were no further violations of sanctions.In addition to halting deliveries of turbines, Siemens said it would sell its stake in Interautomatika, a Russian firm which sells and maintains technology for power plants.Germany, and especially Siemens, once enjoyed warm trade relations with Russia, which was seen as a country with great economic potential that could become a major customer for German goods.But German exports to Russia have plunged because of an economic slump there and international sanctions. German exports to Russia last year were valued at $24 billion, half as much as in 2012, according to the German federal statistics office.Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the German government, said on Friday that the transfer of the turbines was ""completely unacceptable."" The government is considering what action to take in reply, Mr. Seibert told reporters in Berlin.In a speech this month, Markus Ederer, a German deputy foreign minister, called Russia's relocation of the Siemens turbines ""a negative signal.""JACK EWING   Follow Jack Ewing on Twitter @JackEwingNYT.

2388,2425766236.xml,"The disturbingly large numbers of coronavirus cases reported every day since the pandemic exploded may in fact be low -- by a lot. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of infected people ""far exceeds the number of reported cases"" in some sections of the country. The study said that actual infection rates were up to 13 times higher.The analysis, based on antibody tests and published online by JAMA Internal Medicine, suggested that large numbers of people who lacked symptoms and never sought treatment may have kept the virus circulating in their communities. Even so, most people in the study had not been touched by the virus, an important finding for assessing so-called herd immunity, the level of exposure at which the virus stops spreading.The study indicated that even hard-hit New York City, where 23.3 percent of people had coronavirus antibodies in early May, remained well below the infection level required for herd immunity. Experts believe that roughly 60 percent of the population would need to have been exposed to the coronavirus for a city or region to reach herd immunity.But most people in the 10 regions covered in the survey had not been infected. In Utah, for example, the infection rate was just over 1 percent by early June. At about the same time, the rate was 2.2 percent for Minneapolis-St. Paul and 3.6 percent for the Philadelphia metropolitan area.Another study released on Tuesday said that Covid-19 patients are prone to blood clots -- and that clotting problems may be much more common among patients with the virus than among people with other infectious diseases. The study looked at the medical records of 3,334 patients in four hospitals affiliated with N.Y.U. Langone Health in New York and found that clot-related problems -- including blockages in a vein or artery, strokes and heart attacks -- were mentioned 16 percent of the time. By comparison, during the 2009 flu pandemic, blood clots were reported in 5.9 percent of patients, according to the study, published in the journal JAMA.Coronavirus patients with blood clots were also twice as likely to die as those who did not face clotting problems. The study said that 230, or 43 percent of the 533 patients with blood clots, had died, and that the death rate for hospitalized patients who did not have clotting problems was 21 percent.XXXAfter saying on Monday that he wanted to revive the pandemic briefings that he had called off in April, President Trump appeared, by himself, at the lectern in the White House press room on Tuesday. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly declared that the virus would go away, said the pandemic would ""probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better."" He added: ""Something I don't like saying, but that's the way it is. It's what we have.""He also endorsed wearing masks, pulling one out of his pocket. ""I have no problem with a mask,"" he said. ""I view it this way. Anything that could potentially help"" is worth trying.The president's decision to reinstate the briefings had appeared to catch Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, unawares on Monday. He did not attend the briefing, although the president said that Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, was ""right outside."" About an hour earlier, Dr. Fauci had said on CNN that ""I was not invited, up to this point.""But there is one place Dr. Fauci is certain to be: Watching the Washington Nationals on Thursday. He is to throw out the first pitch before the Nationals play the Yankees in the first game of the pandemic-delayed baseball season. The team described him as a ""Nats superfan.""(His loyalty has shifted: In 1989 he said that he rooted for the New York Yankees as a boy growing up in Brooklyn. ""I was somewhat of a sports outcast among my friends, who were all Brooklyn Dodgers fans,"" he said then.)XXXChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was the central figure in shaping a compromise on a coronavirus stimulus package for the European Union. But the consensus came at a public cost: The rancorous bargaining exposed serious divisions within the E.U. The talks were defined by shifting roles among members trying to elbow their way to the forefront now that Britain has stopped taking part in summits.The $857 billion package was noteworthy for its calling on countries in the bloc to raise money by selling bonds collectively. Much of that money would be distributed as grants that would not need to be repaid by virus-ravaged countries like Italy. ""Exceptional situations require exceptional measures,"" Ms. Merkel said at a news conference.Across the English Channel, Britain announced pay raises for 900,000 public workers -- 3.1 percent for teachers, 2.8 percent for dentists and 2 to 2.5 percent for the police and the military. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said the additional money was in recognition of ""what we always knew -- that our public sector workers make a vital contribution."" (Nurses and other National Health Service staff members are not included in the deal, because they negotiated a three-year pay increase in 2018.)In Washington, talks on the next coronavirus relief package moved to Capitol Hill, where Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, spent hours trying to iron out differences with Republicans and reach out to Democrats. Sketching out what is expected to be a $1 trillion package, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called for another round of checks to families, along with $105 billion in aid for schools. But he signaled that the package would not be ready for consideration until early next month, after enhanced unemployment benefits have lapsed.Mr. McConnell did not explain what he planned to do about those benefits, which some Republicans want to scale back. Nor did he say whether the school funding in his bill would be tied to in-person classes, as the president has demanded.""We're all going to see if we can get on the same page,"" Mr. McConnell told reporters.Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-07-22
2928,1548604448.xml,"       BERLIN --  The German Army is fighting for survival. But not on the conventional battlefield. Barely six months after becoming the first woman to serve as her country's defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen has mounted a most unusual campaign and, this being Germany, given it a very long name: an Attraktivitätsoffensive. (Roughly translated, a charm offensive.) On paper, this program to woo soldiers and modernize the armed forces reads like a mixture of an Ikea catalog -- ""new furniture sets planned, light, modern, livable"" -- and a management manual, peppered with promises of ""das Coaching"" for officers, and an ""e-recruiting platform."" There are provisions that allow for more working from home and job sharing for parents, and for extended child care that matches the hours of shifts. While many might smile, the reason for the courtship is coldly pragmatic: Germany is confronting a demographic crisis, and its all-volunteer army is just one of many enterprises seeking ever-scarcer skilled labor. In order not to lose a prospective soldier to the cozier realms of Deutsche Bank or the auto assembly lines at Opel or Mercedes-Benz, the army needs to appear more attractive. The conscription pinch, which comes as Germany is debating just how boldly to assert itself amid the crisis in Ukraine and tensions with Russia, presents a signal challenge to the country's future security. ""The time when we could pick and choose from a large pool of conscripts is over,"" Ms. von der Leyen said when rolling out the program, which will cost more than $130 million. ""We are facing a huge challenge,"" competing more than ever with other employers, and must offer training, conditions and a career path that keep pace, she said, playing down the obvious risks involved in military life. Ms. von der Leyen, a mother of seven, has taken a fair bit of criticism for being so, well, feminine. Malcontents in the military muttered that a woman who had previously served as family minister and then labor minister was focusing on what she knew how to do, rather than the really serious business of combat doctrine and acquiring multibillion-euro weapons systems. Ms. von der Leyen ""clearly has no idea about the military,"" said Harald Kujat, the retired inspector general of the armed forces. Berthold Meyer, an expert on Germany's armed forces, or Bundeswehr, said, ""Many people are still very irritated that there is a woman in that job."" Although women have been admitted for 10 years, they still make up only about 10 percent of the 183,000 armed forces, short of a 15 percent target, Mr. Meyer added. ""The military in Germany is really still seen as a domain for men,"" he said. But Ms. von der Leyen, a brisk, center-right career politician often seen as a rival and potential successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, has recognized a problem that goes beyond gender. The children who might be the new soldiers of 2024 have, experts noted, already been born. There are just under 700,000 of them, and about half of those are girls less likely to choose the military than their male peers. Encouraging even 10 percent of the approximately 300,000 boys with German citizenship to consider the Bundeswehr is a tall order -- and yet Ms. von der Leyen says 60,000 applicants are needed in order to select the best. Hence the charm offensive and new ads that promote the military as ""Out Ahead. Active. Attractive. Alternative."" But no matter how much the excitement is emphasized, Mr. Meyer noted, ""the soldier's profession per se is not really friendly to families."" Even with Germany's mission in Afghanistan ending this year, he noted, ""you have to accept that you are going to get sent somewhere on a mission in which it is a case of life and death. There is only so far you can go to make that palatable to human beings."" In Germany, where history looms large, there is a special difficulty in making the military tempting. A century after German militarism helped set off World War I and 75 years since the start of World War II, the pacifist impulse is strong. As a result, the military here is held in nothing resembling the regard often accorded members of the armed forces in the United States, Britain or France. ""In America,"" said Hellmut Königshaus, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, ""if someone in uniform arrives somewhere, people may go up and shake their hand, and thank them for their service. In Germany, that is almost unthinkable."" Michael Wolffsohn, a professor and military expert, said, ""That Germans have been so de-Germanized is actually wonderful,"" referring to Germany's brutal history. But he conceded that, practically, diffidence about the military plays out in ways destined to put people off a military career. It would be unthinkable for American officers to have to house themselves and their families, but the Bundeswehr has no obligation to house junior recruits over the age of 25. Junior forces are often cramped three or four to a bare-bones room with clunky cupboards, no computer and a bathroom in the corridor. Mr. Königshaus, whose job as independent watchman over the military makes him a conduit for about 5,000 complaints a year from soldiers, cited cases of junior officers expected to make a salary of about $2,820 a month stretch for their own housing in an expensive city like Munich, and perhaps separate accommodation elsewhere for their spouse or partner and children. Frequent transfers make it ever harder, he said, for soldiers to live with partners who cannot get short-term jobs in a labor market that still favors long-term employment at one company. And the federal system that leaves education in the hands of Germany's 16 states stymies easy switches between very different schools. More than 50 percent of men and women in the armed forces commute between their place of residence and their base, with 38 percent at home only on weekends, according to Mr. Königshaus, who said he had not visited one base last year that had adequate quarters to accommodate these ""wanderers."" In light of all this, experts noted, it is also no surprise that the military has not proved to be a path -- as in America or Israel -- for minorities to assimilate, rise, and help avert any demographic crisis. A visit to the sprawling Julius Leber barracks in Berlin -- the largest military base in any city in Europe, built for Hermann Goering and used by the French throughout the Cold War -- illustrated that Germans in their 20s and 30s can feel well served by the army. Four soldiers selected by the Defense Ministry to talk to a reporter relayed grumbles from others about frequent moves, inadequate housing or lack of family-friendly facilities -- ""I don't know any soldier who loves moving every two years,"" said Capt. Marija Wollweber, 28 -- but all expressed contentment. Captain Wollweber, who works mostly propagating the army in schools, and two others had had their university studies financed entirely by the armed forces, and all three were planning to leave the armed forces after 12 or 15 years, which included the time at college. If Ms. von der Leyen succeeds in luring more soldiers, it will be good for both the German Army and perhaps an eventual bid by her for the chancellorship. If she fails, it might end her political career. But the defense portfolio is notoriously tricky in Germany; Ms. Merkel has had four defense ministers since taking power in 2005. Much to the consternation of Washington, no European country comes anywhere close to matching the United States in military spending. That includes Germany, whose defense budget of about $44 billion amounts to about 1.3 percent of its gross domestic product, compared with over 4 percent for the United States. Now, in part because of the demands of Ms. Merkel's coalition partners, the Social Democrats, the Defense Ministry faces even steeper budget challenges, Mr. Wolffsohn said. But when it comes to the army, he noted, Germans should learn: ""You can't have your cake and eat it too.""

3022,1970895334.xml,"Call it the expectations two-step.For the past 18 months, political analysts have issued dire warnings about the likelihood that far-right parties could gain power and influence in elections. Then, when the parties merely broke historical records, rather than winning control of their government, those same analysts would breathe a sigh of relief.
But that repeated dance may have led us to overlook another, more subtle but possibly more systemic risk, present even if the far right is only a minority. The problem is that far-right parties may win seats in elections, but they end up having little power because mainstream parties shut them out. This, in turn, angers their supporters, fueling complaints that the system is rigged.
And that worry seems pressing in light of the struggle by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to build a workable coalition government after her party again failed to win a majority.
Ms. Merkel is facing a daunting choice. She can continue her efforts to create a coalition, even though all potential parties have so far been unwilling. If those attempts fail, Ms. Merkel has signaled that she would prefer new elections over her other option of forming a minority government.
Stated another way, she must decide whether to rely on voters or on institutions.
Those are the two most fundamental building blocks of democracy. But in Germany, as in much of the rest of the West right now, both seem increasingly unreliable.
The result is that democracy now feels like a dangerous game. And even Ms. Merkel, arguably the Western leader who plays it best, has not figured out how to win.
Democracy ... Except Some Votes Don't Really Count
As the far right rises across Europe, mainstream parties, seeing an existential threat to liberal democracy, have searched for ways to contain its influence. The solution that major European powers like France and Germany have settled on -- and that will be a component of any solution to Ms. Merkel's current dilemma -- is a so-called cordon sanitaire against the far right.
The term, which roughly translated means ""quarantine"" in French, means sealing off the far right from any power or influence, no matter how many votes it wins. Mainstream parties will not allow the far right into political coalitions or work with it on joint legislation. In Germany's case, that means an absolute refusal to allow the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into any governing coalition. The party recently won seats in Germany's national legislature for the first time.
In the short term, such policies have effectively limited the influence of both longstanding far-right parties like the National Front in France and insurgent upstarts like the AfD. To the many politicians and citizens who fear what might happen if the far right were to exercise real power, that feels like an important victory.
But in the longer term, it turns out to have unintended side effects, making the underlying problems worse -- with potentially serious consequences for democracy.
David Art, a professor at Tufts University who studies the European far right, said the mismatch between the votes the far right receives and the influence it wields was one of the ""greatest untold stories"" of far-right politics.
Policies devised to lock the far right out of power mean far-right voters ""have gotten extremely little bang for their buck,"" Professor Art said. ""You have somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of the European electorate casting its votes for parties that are credibly shut out.""
And shutting a large populist party out of power for years has consequences for the political system itself, not just for that party and its voters.
As the far right's share of the vote grows, that increases pressure on mainstream parties to cooperate with each other to present a united front and contain the threat. This can mean forming a grand coalition, in which the two largest parties join together despite their political differences.
The result, Professor Art said, is that mainstream politics can start to look like an elite cartel, in which establishment parties must maintain consensus to govern, and so are limited to an increasingly narrow lane of policy options regardless of what voters demand or issues require.
Making the Far Right's Arguments For It
The problem with that goes beyond legislation. That kind of consensus politics can end up looking an awful lot like far-right populist parties' claim that all mainstream parties are the same, controlled by elites who do not listen to the people.
At far-right rallies in Europe this year, many supporters told me they saw mainstream parties as all the same and out of touch, an elite establishment unwilling to listen to people's political demands.
At a rally in Potsdam, Germany, for instance, a chemist who asked to be called Frau Doktor Huss, for fear of consequences if her views became known, declared that she was ""totally against"" the establishment, which she accused of silencing debate and trying to impose multiculturalism on an unwilling population.
And in Fréjus, France, a local official, Gilles Longo, said he felt ""betrayed"" by former President Nicolas Sarkozy's cooperation with the left. ""The people who want the National Front, it's because they don't believe in the other parties any longer,"" he said.
Cordon sanitaire politics can, ironically, end up making these far-right critiques of the establishment more true, by ensuring that mainstream parties really do have to embrace similar positions to reach consensus, and by setting up the political system as the far right versus everyone else.
And supporters of mainstream parties may also grow discontented as they come to see the political system as more concerned with preserving elite consensus than representing voters.
Short-Term Solutions, Deepening Long-Term Problems
This type of political maneuvering, though an effective short-term solution to the political volatility of contemporary democracy, can end up making the underlying causes of that volatility worse.
In Germany, the two largest political parties, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, known as the C.D.U., and the center-left Social Democratic Party, the S.P.D., lost a total of 95 seats in the most recent election, a result that many party leaders attribute to a rejection of their grand coalition by voters.
But after Ms. Merkel's effort to create a coalition with two smaller parties failed, the C.D.U. and S.P.D. are once again considering joining talks about a new coalition.
That sets up a stark choice: Either the mainstream parties will join together in a coalition that voters have already rejected, or the German president will have to call a new election, invalidating the previous vote entirely.
Either option seems likely to dent voters' faith in the system. Democracy's central tenet is that political legitimacy comes from voter support.
If people stop believing that their votes count, and parties come to see voters as untrustworthy decision makers, then that sets up a far deeper danger -- that voters and institutions will become not just unreliable, but not fully invested in the democratic system.
That would render those fundamental building blocks of democracy, and thus democracy itself, even more unstable. And as volatility increases, short-term solutions to restore stability could ultimately undermine it.

4140,1269945919.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDLONDON -- Now, it is David Cameron's turn. Weighted down by centuries of entrenched wariness in this island nation toward the Continent -- and the knowledge that a gallery of his predecessors as Conservative prime ministers saw their tenures blighted by divisions within the party over the issue -- Mr. Cameron is heading for Amsterdam on Friday to set out his vision of a sharply whittled-down role for Britain in the affairs of 21st-century Europe. The speech in the Netherlands, carefully chosen as a country with a strong historical friendship with Britain, is a watershed moment for Mr. Cameron, and for Britain. It could be a deeply jarring occasion, as well, for other European nations, which have grown increasingly impatient, angry even, with Britain's policy during the crisis in the euro zone. Some European officials have described as blackmail its use of the crisis -- one that Britain, with the pound, has largely escaped -- to demand a new, ""pick-and-mix"" status for itself within the 27-nation European Union. After months of delay, Mr. Cameron is expected to brush aside the warnings of the Obama administration and European leaders and call for a referendum on whether Britain should remain squarely in Europe or negotiate a more arm's-length relationship, most likely before the next Parliament's mandate expires in 2018. In a clamorous House of Commons on Wednesday, the prime minister set out his thinking. ""Millions of people in this country, myself included, want Britain to stay in the European Union,"" he said. ""But they believe that there are chances to negotiate a better relationship. Throughout Europe, countries are looking at forthcoming treaty change, and asking, 'What can I do to maximize my national interest?' That is what the Germans will do. That is what the Spanish will do. That is what the British should do."" For months, Mr. Cameron has been holding off on a promise to explain just what he wants from Europe. As a reformist Conservative pressing ahead with, among other things, a plan to legalize gay marriage, he has scant common ground with the ""little Englanders"" in his party, the core of about 100 members who make up a third of its representation in Parliament. But Mr. Cameron can see votes, too, in the strong anti-Europe currents that run wherever people in Britain gather. In pubs and bars, on radio and in Parliament itself, talk of the European Union tends to center on the bloc's real -- and, in some cases, apocryphal -- abuses: its highhanded, bloated bureaucracy, with nearly 1,000 featherbedded officials earning more than Mr. Cameron's $230,000 salary as prime minister; its endless proliferation of rules on everything from the length of dog leashes to the shape of carrots; the recent claim by a former high-ranking Cameron aide that government ministers spend 40 percent of their time dealing with the mass of pettifogging European ""directives,"" many of them widely ignored elsewhere in Europe. Not only has Mr. Cameron been hemmed in by deep divisions over Europe within the Conservative Party -- an issue that helped unseat Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher and John Major as prime ministers -- but he has also been wary of stirring a fresh wave of anger among other European leaders, particularly Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a center-right politician and onetime ally in European councils. Her aides have described her as frustrated with Mr. Cameron's maneuvering and, as she is said to see it, his bid to take advantage of other European states as they struggle to save the euro and keep the most debt-laden nations, like Greece, Portugal and Spain, from dropping out of the European Union. Concern about the reactions in Berlin and Paris prompted a last-minute rescheduling of the Amsterdam speech. Germany and France had protested that the original date, next Monday, might overshadow long-planned celebrations that day of the 50th anniversary of the treaty between them, itself a landmark in the building of postwar Europe, that sealed their reconciliation after the wounds of World War II. Along with this, commentators say, Mr. Cameron has been recalculating the ways in which the European issue can be managed to bolster the Conservatives' sagging prospects in a general election expected in 2015, in which polls show them lagging as much as 13 percentage points behind the opposition Labour Party. He has also been contending with heavy lobbying by American officials, including President Obama. The Americans, diplomats say, have told Mr. Cameron squarely in private what made headlines here last week when a senior State Department official, Philip Gordon, who is assistant secretary for European affairs, spoke on the issue with British reporters. Mr. Gordon said a continued ""strong British voice"" in an ""outward-looking"" European Union was in America's interests, and warned specifically against the referendum on Europe that is an important component in Mr. Cameron's plans. ""Referendums,"" Mr. Gordon said, ""have often turned countries inward."" For all his delaying, his aides say, Mr. Cameron is ready now to outline a strategy for renegotiating Britain's status in the European Union in a way that would keep Britain free from the centralizing forces at work. Other major European states, France and Germany in particular, see a new federal Europe with enhanced powers of fiscal oversight as essential to the long-term survival of the tottering euro. A referendum, the first on Britain's European Union membership since the one in 1975 that overwhelmingly approved British entry in the union's precursor, the European Economic Community, would aim at settling whether Britain will continue in the union or seek a new role free from the entanglement with European laws, regulations and court rulings that have aroused widespread antipathy among ""euro skeptics"" in the Conservative Party and elsewhere on the center-right of British politics. The models for this new Britain, some have said, would be Norway or Switzerland, both outside the European Union, or possibly Singapore, a prosperous island nation. As a nation that flirted with adopting the euro when the currency was begun in 1999, but chose to stick with the pound, Britain is already outside the core, 17-nation euro zone. Proponents of withdrawal say it could negotiate trading and other economic ties with the European Union that would avert the economic disaster that many center-left politicians and business leaders in Britain say would be the inevitable price of dropping out. On both sides of the raucous, embittered debate in Britain, a referendum has long been viewed as a nuclear option. Mr. Cameron has said all along that he wants Britain to remain in the European bloc but on terms better suited to Britain's autonomous urges and its desire for a ""more flexible, competitive"" Europe. He says he believes a referendum on a sparer role for Britain, with the European Union's power to regulate social, legal and financial matters sharply trimmed back, would yield a strong popular mandate for remaining in the union. For many years, polls in Britain have shown a majority for withdrawal, and Mr. Cameron's critics say his plan could set the country on a ""sleepwalk"" toward that. With five years of uncertainty before the vote likely to compound the woes, a recession-bound British economy has failed to respond to the harsh austerity measures that the Cameron government has prescribed as the route back to prosperity. That has been a major theme in the stark warnings in recent days from elder statesmen in the Conservative Party, and from a group of powerful business leaders. Those leaders have argued that the prospect of a referendum, with its threat of choking off European markets accounting for more than half of all Britain's exports of goods and services, could stifle the foreign investment that Britain needs if it is to make major headway in trimming the ranks of its 2.5 million unemployed.

450,2490898447.xml,"The new president's vow to restore the trans-Atlantic alliance is welcome, but Europeans want a more balanced relationship, with more dialogue and less diktat.WASHINGTON -- Two weeks after President Biden's inauguration, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke publicly about the importance of dialogue with Moscow, saying that Russia is a part of Europe that cannot simply be shunned and that Europe must be strong enough to defend its own interests.On Dec. 30, just weeks before the inauguration, the European Union clinched an important investment agreement with China, days after a tweet by Mr. Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, asking for ""early consultations"" with Europe on China and seeming to caution against a quick deal.So even as the United States resets under new White House leadership, Europe is charting its own course on Russia and China in ways that do not necessarily align with Mr. Biden's goals, posing a challenge as the new American president sets out to rebuild a post-Trump alliance with the Continent.On Friday, Mr. Biden will address the Munich Security Conference, a gathering of leaders and diplomats from Europe and the United States that he has attended for decades and that helped cement his reputation as a champion of trans-Atlantic solidarity.Speaking at the conference two years ago, Mr. Biden lamented the damage the Trump administration had inflicted on the once-sturdy postwar relationship between Washington and Europe's major capitals. ""This too shall pass,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We will be back."" He promised that the United States would again ""shoulder our responsibility of leadership.""The president's remarks on Friday are sure to repeat that promise and spotlight his now-familiar call for a more unified Western front against the anti-democratic threats posed by Russia and China. In many ways, such talk is sure to be received like a warm massage by European leaders tensed and shellshocked by four years of President Donald J. Trump's mercurial and often contemptuous diplomacy.But if by ""leadership"" Mr. Biden means a return to the traditional American assumption -- we decide and you follow -- many Europeans feel that that world is gone, and that Europe must not behave like America's junior wingman in fights defined by Washington.Demonstrated by the European Union's trade deal with China, and conciliatory talk about Moscow from leaders like Mr. Macron and Germany's likely next chancellor, Armin Laschet, Europe has its own set of interests and ideas about how to manage the United States' two main rivals, ones that will complicate Mr. Biden's diplomacy.""Biden is signaling an incredibly hawkish approach to Russia, lumping it in with China, and defining a new global Cold War against authoritarianism,"" said Jeremy Shapiro, the research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations.That makes many European leaders nervous, he said. And other regional experts said they had seen fewer signs of overt enthusiasm from the Continent than Biden administration officials might have hoped for.""There was always a cleareyed recognition that we weren't just going to be able to show up and say, 'Hey guys, we're back!""' said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who was in line to become the National Security Council director for Russia but who did not take the job for personal reasons.""But even with all of that, I think there was optimism that it would be easier than it looks like it's going to be,"" said Ms. Kendall-Taylor, the director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.Ulrich Speck, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, added: ""After the freeze in relations under Trump, I expected more warming. I don't see it yet.""Mr. Biden quickly took many of the easiest steps toward reconciliation and unity with Europe, including rejoining the Paris climate agreement, renewing an emphasis on multilateralism and human rights, and vowing to rejoin the disintegrating 2015 Iran nuclear deal.But aligning against Russia and China will be much more difficult.China may be a peer rival for the United States, but it has long been a vital trade partner for Europe. And while European leaders see Beijing as a systemic rival and competitor, they also see it as a partner, and hardly view it as an enemy.And Russia remains a nuclear-armed neighbor, however truculent, and has financial and emotional leverage of its own.Since Mr. Biden was last in the White House, as vice president during the Obama administration, Britain, historically the United States' most reliable diplomatic partner, has left the European Union and now coordinates foreign policy less effectively with its continental allies.""That sophisticated British view of the world is absent,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state and ambassador to NATO in the George W. Bush administration. ""I don't think the U.S. is intertwined yet with Europe, diplomatically and strategically,"" he added.This week's security conference is not run by the German government, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will address it, along with Mr. Biden, Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain. And Germany itself illustrates some of the problems the Biden administration will face in its effort to lock arms against Moscow.Ms. Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Party has chosen Mr. Laschet as its leader, and he is its likely candidate to succeed her in autumn elections. But Mr. Laschet is more sympathetic than Mr. Biden to both Russia and China. He has cast doubt on the extent of Russian political disinformation and hacking operations and publicly criticized ""marketable anti-Putin populism."" He has also been a strong supporter of Germany's export-led economy, which is deeply reliant on China.Germany still intends to put into operation the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a 746-mile natural gas artery that runs under the Baltic Sea from northern Russia to Germany. The paired pipelines are owned by Gazprom, itself owned by Russia. Work stopped on the project last year -- with 94 percent of the pipes laid -- after the U.S. Congress imposed further sanctions on the project on the grounds that it helped fund the Kremlin, damaged Ukraine and gave Russia the potential to manipulate Europe's energy supply.Last year, German politicians responded to threats of economic punishment made by Republican American senators by claiming ""blackmail,"" ""economic war"" and ""neo-imperialism."" Many want to complete the pipeline project, but on Tuesday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters that Mr. Biden opposed it as a ""bad deal"" that divided Europe and made it more vulnerable to Russian treachery.Despite the sanctions, Russian ships have renewed laying pipes, and Ms. Merkel defends the project as a business venture, not a geopolitical statement. The Germans argue that European Union energy regulations and new pipeline configurations reduce Russian ability to manipulate supplies and that Russia is more dependent on the income than Europe is on the gas.There are signs that, as with the China deal, the Biden administration wants to move on and negotiate a solution with Germany, to remove a major irritant with a crucial ally. That could include, some suggest, snapback sanctions if Moscow diverts supplies or halts transit fees to Ukraine.In France, Mr. Macron has long sought to develop a more positive dialogue with Mr. Putin, but his efforts for a ""reset"" have gone nowhere. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, tried something similar this month with embarrassing results when Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia humiliated him at a news conference and called the European Union ""an unreliable partner.""Together with the attempted assassination and then the jailing of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, the treatment of Mr. Borrell means that Brussels is likely to place new sanctions on Russia, but not before the end of March, and will be more open to Mr. Biden's suggestions for a tougher line.Biden administration officials say that coordinating with a fractious Europe has never been easy and that its leaders welcome restored American leadership -- especially on a Chinese threat more apparent to Europe than it was five years ago.As for China and the investment agreement, after seven years of difficult talks, European officials have defended it as largely an effort to obtain the same access to the Chinese market for their companies that American firms had received through Mr. Trump's China deal last year.""There is no reason for us to suffer from an unlevel playing field, including vis-à-vis the U.S.,"" Sabine Weyand, the E.U. director general for trade, said in a virtual forum in early February. ""Why should we sit still?""Ms. Weyand said the deal set high standards for Chinese trade practices, which would ultimately put the United States and Europe ""in a stronger position to have a more assertive policy together on China.""The deal must be ratified by the European Parliament, however, which has been critical of its failure to guarantee more labor rights, and it is unlikely to come to a vote until much later this year. And, again, Biden administration officials seem to be willing to move on, given the importance of cooperation with Europe on China.""The deal potentially could complicate trans-Atlantic cooperation on China,"" said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, ""but I don't think it's going to preclude it.""Michael Crowley reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

2968,883817461.xml,"      FRANKFURT -- Europe's sovereign debt crisis threatened to spill over into the broader economy after official figures released Tuesday showed that growth in the euro zone fell to its lowest rate in two years. Germany -- the Continent's powerhouse -- slowed almost to a standstill.    Most of Europe's main stock indexes lost ground after the data suggested that the debt and economic problems in countries like Greece and Italy were infecting the rest of the 17-country euro zone. The crisis has led a number of governments to sharply cut spending while weathering market turmoil that has damaged business and consumer confidence.    President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Tuesday in Paris that they would take steps toward a closer political and economic union in the euro zone and would work toward balanced budgets and debt reduction. But resolving the sovereign debt crisis would be much harder if the economies continue to stall or shrink. European markets were closed by the time the statement was issued, but American markets sold off after the news on worries over Europe.    Gross domestic product in the euro zone rose a mere 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2011 from the first quarter, when growth had advanced by a healthy 0.8 percent, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. Quarterly economic growth across euro zone was the slowest since mid-2009.    G.D.P. growth in Germany, which has been the tractor hauling the rest of Europe, barely budged, rising only 0.1 percent from the first quarter, when the economy had expanded a robust 1.3 percent, the German Federal Statistical Office said. Quarter-on-quarter growth in the three months through June was well below forecasts of 0.5 percent. The German figures come after data on Friday showed that the French economy was at a standstill in the second quarter, leaving Europe's two largest economies barely growing.    Because government revenue is directly tied to economic growth, the two pillars of the European economy may be less able -- and less willing -- to prop up the weaker members.   ""It's the biggest potential risk,"" said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ""I don't worry so much about a moderation of growth two years after a recession. What is different this time is the potential escalation of the sovereign debt crisis.""    European stocks initially fell sharply on Tuesday, but recovered late in the day. The benchmark indexes in Germany and France all closed down less than 1 percent, and the euro fell to $1.4407 from $1.4444.    The German economic rebound since the recession of 2009, driven by exports of cars, machinery and other goods to China and other emerging markets, has helped counterbalance weak economies in southern Europe. But if Germany slows for an extended period, the challenges posed by the European sovereign debt crisis will become that much more daunting.    Despite signs that austerity programs were hurting growth, debt-ridden governments probably have little choice but to continue to cut spending to persuade their creditors that they can meet their debt obligations. Equally important, the European Central Bank has made it clear that it would support Italy and Spain by buying their bonds only if they continued to cut their deficits.    The slowdown in Germany was caused by lower household consumption and construction investment, the German statistics office said. In addition, imports rose faster than exports and led to a buildup of inventories.    Mr. Kramer of Commerzbank said that a warm spring meant that construction projects in Germany had begun earlier than usual, subtracting some activity from the second quarter.    Germany had been enjoying a period of unusually high growth, during which the number of people employed rose 1.4 percent, to 41 million people from a year earlier, the German statistics office said Tuesday. Even with the slowdown in the second quarter, the economy still grew 2.7 percent from a year earlier.    The Federal Statistical Office revised its figures for previous quarters, which meant that, contrary to earlier data, German output remained below its peak in late 2008.    The slowdown was foreshadowed by earnings from companies like Siemens and Deutsche Bank that fell short of analysts' expectations, reinforcing the feeling that the pace of German growth was flattening. Surveys of business sentiment have also pointed to slower growth.    Greece is already in recession, while growth in Spain slowed to 0.2 percent from 0.3 percent in the previous quarter.    Trade data from Eurostat contributed to the gloomy picture. Seasonally adjusted figures showed that exports and imports in the euro area slowed in June, while the trade deficit widened to 1.6 billion euros ($2.3 billion).

2299,1679657668.xml,"       LONDON --  Prime Minister David Cameron, having achieved a smashing and unexpected outright victory in Britain's general election, heads into his second term facing severe challenges to his nation's identity and place in the world: how to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union and Scotland in the United Kingdom. In vanquishing the opposition Labour Party and winning an absolute majority in Parliament, Mr. Cameron gained the right to govern without a coalition partner, allowing him to claim a mandate on Friday to pursue his own agenda. But his majority is so narrow that it will force him to tread carefully with his own fractious legislators to pass legislation and address issues that could fundamentally redefine 21st-century Britain. Those start with his pledge to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 on Britain's continued membership in the European Union. He will also be under increased pressure from the other big winner of the election, the Scottish National Party, to revisit the question of independence for Scotland. ""A small majority can quickly turn into a bed of nails,"" said Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator magazine. Backbenchers in Mr. Cameron's own party, many of them farther to the right than he is on questions of immigration and Britain's membership in the European Union, ""will be his real opposition,"" Mr. Nelson said. More than in his first-term coalition with the centrist Liberal Democrats, which gave the government a large majority, Mr. Cameron will have to keep his own troops in line. His parliamentary managers, known as ""whips"" for good reason, will get plenty of exercise. Complicating Mr. Cameron's life is the fact that this election was also a huge victory for the Scottish National Party, which won 56 of Scotland's 59 seats, giving it a strong voice in Westminster and making Scotland essentially a one-party state. The party wants an independent Scotland and is already considering putting a new referendum on independence into its party program for regional elections a year from now. Scotland voted against independence last September, but Thursday's vote made clear that the dream remains very much alive among Scottish separatists. On Friday, in front of 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron promised to ""govern with respect"" and ""as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom."" But it will be easier said than done, especially after he demonized the Scottish National Party during the campaign. In essence, England and Scotland are today not one nation but two, each dominated by a single party. How far Mr. Cameron manages to satisfy Scotland and keep Britain together will be crucial to his legacy. One prominent party member, Mayor Boris Johnson of London, who won his own seat in Parliament, was already suggesting on Friday that it was time to adopt some form of federalism. That task will require a delicacy of touch and generosity of spirit that the Conservatives, once labeled ""the nasty party,"" are not thought to possess in large amounts. The fate of Scotland will also be tied to Mr. Cameron's other main challenge: Britain's relationship with Europe. He has promised repeatedly that, if re-elected, he would hold a referendum on continued British membership in the European Union by the end of 2017, after efforts to negotiate a ""better deal"" with Brussels. If Britain votes to leave the European Union -- not likely, but still a significant possibility, and higher under a majority Conservative government -- pro-Europe Scotland would almost surely bring forward another referendum on independence, one that might very well pass. Mr. Cameron's task in Brussels will not be simple, because he wants alterations in the system of free movement of people and labor that could require a treaty change, a complicated and lengthy process. Even nontreaty changes would have to be approved by all 28 member states. Still, with his electoral mandate -- and the considerable showing in the popular vote of the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party -- European colleagues, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, will have little choice but to work with Mr. Cameron to keep Britain a member. Nonetheless, Mr. Cameron faces considerable opposition to continued British membership, no matter what the terms, from within his own party. In the last Parliament, about a third of Conservative members were considered to be firmly anti-European, and that is unlikely to have changed very much. And angry or disappointed party legislators are a great danger for small parliamentary majorities. In 1992, for example, Prime Minister John Major, also a Conservative, had a larger majority than Mr. Cameron does now, but saw it shrink steadily as the party fought over Europe and the Maastricht Treaty on further integration. Times are different, argued Alan Duncan, a Conservative legislator, saying that his colleagues would be careful not to undermine the victory Mr. Cameron has brought them. Still, if Mr. Cameron, as expected after negotiations with Brussels, decides to support Britain's staying in the European Union, it is very likely that a sizable number of Tory backbenchers will oppose him and campaign to leave Europe. Some might even defect to the U.K. Independence Party, which took nearly 13 percent of the popular vote nationwide on Thursday, even though the party only won one seat and its leader, Nigel Farage, resigned. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, put it bluntly in a note to clients in which he argued that the risk of Britain's leaving the European Union ""will jolt European politics for the next two years."" ""The U.K. will hold a referendum on its E.U. membership in 2017 following a renegotiation of membership terms,"" he wrote. ""The result will be uncertain, as Cameron grapples with the impossible demands of Euroskeptics in his party and the unwillingness of other E.U. capitals to offer significant concessions."" Mr. Cameron must also deal with the temptation to govern as the head of ""Little England,"" distanced from Europe and from strategic and military allies like the United States and France.  There will be other tensions. Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, have also laid out plans for continued spending cuts to bring down the big budget deficit and the national debt, promising a fully balanced budget by the end of the next Parliament in 2020. Without a formal coalition partner, the party can do roughly what it pleases, so long as it does not suffer any backbench revolt. As laid out in the Conservative manifesto, the cuts would be deep outside certain protected areas like the National Health Service, and might be about 30 billion pounds, or about $49 billion. Mr. Osborne is driven by a Thatcherite belief in the value of a smaller state to free up individual and corporate enterprise and encourage those able to work to do so, and such cuts could create political tensions, and even unrest, in the country. Mr. Osborne is respected, but his economic theology is not shared by every Tory, which could also lead to defections and close votes. Mr. Cameron has never been very popular with some of his backbenchers. They are sure to be shocked and overjoyed at the victory he brought them, as they feared Labour would manage, with the Scots, to create a majority to throw the Tories out of power. Even the most optimistic Conservatives were talking about winning 300 seats, which pollsters thought was hallucinatory. In the end, Mr. Cameron and his campaign brought 331. That will buy him considerable credibility for a time. But not forever. Prime Minister David Cameron and His Wife, Samantha, at 10 Downing Street On Friday After the Conservative Victory.

3642,1353975483.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  The European Union inched closer to ending bank secrecy on Wednesday when Austria agreed to eventually start sharing personal bank account information with other countries as long as similar rules also applied to tax havens like Switzerland that are not part of the 27-nation bloc.  It was the first time that Austria, long notorious for its opaque banking culture, has made such a commitment, after rebuffing calls for greater transparency for a decade. The country's chancellor said it expected to reach an agreement in principle on the matter by the end of the year. That news, at a summit meeting of European leaders here, upstaged a separate but related topic that has dominated headlines this week: tax-reduction strategies by big multinational companies like Apple, which Congressional investigators in Washington say reduced its tax bill by setting up companies in Ireland. Pressure on Austria has grown more intense as European countries try to curb citizens' ability to stash money in other jurisdictions, shortchanging their home governments of tax revenue during a time of lean budgets and gaping deficits. Ferreting out hidden bank accounts has become a cause célèbre in many countries, especially Greece, which has jailed hundreds of people suspected of tax delinquency, including former government officials. In France, Jérôme Cahuzac, a French minister responsible for fighting tax evasion, resigned upon admitting, after weeks of denials, that he had held a secret bank account in Switzerland. The European Commission, the administrative body for the union estimates that tax fraud and legal tax avoidance by individuals and companies cost governments there a total of $1.3 trillion a year. The crackdown on bank secrecy in Europe is also a result of American demands for fuller cross-border sharing of information under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. ""We will act jointly, and I believe we will manage the exchange of data by the end of the year,"" the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, said at the meeting here. Mr. Faymann said it was a ""bad day for tax cheats."" But he stressed that Austria's concessions were contingent on the ""negotiations with third countries"" like Switzerland. Austrian officials say that without overhauls in those other jurisdictions, financial services industries in the European Union would be at a competitive disadvantage. The European leaders, who met for four hours on Wednesday, also confirmed that the European Commission would negotiate tougher agreements with five countries: Switzerland, Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and Liechtenstein. The chances of the other countries agreeing quickly are not great. And bloc officials warned that those countries could turn the tables by asking the union to make changes first, risking a standoff. But those countries are also being pressed by the United States for details of all accounts held by American taxpayers. Under that pressure, they may decide there is not much point in digging in their heels with the European Union. The European negotiations might also clear the way for action by Luxembourg, a bloc member that agreed last month to share banking data starting in January 2015. But it is still awaiting the outcome of talks with the Swiss before deciding whether to expand the information exchange agreement to include investments like trusts and foundations. Once discussions with Switzerland are completed, Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, said his country ""would be in a position to decide the extent of the expansion"" of the information exchange. The summit meeting was billed as an opportunity to push ahead with a crackdown on tax evasion, but it risked being overshadowed by mounting indignation over reports that American companies, including Apple, had sheltered profits in European countries like Ireland. Findings by Senate investigators in Washington indicated this week that Apple sharply reduced its tax bill in the United States and the rest of the world by recording most of its worldwide income in Ireland and paying low corporate tax rates there. The findings and subsequent outcry put the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, on the defensive even before he arrived here on Wednesday. ""I'd like to repeat that Ireland's corporate tax rate is statute-based, is very clear and very transparent -- and we do not do special deals with any individual companies in regard to that tax rate,"" Mr. Kenny said Wednesday afternoon. ""Our country has had its stable corporate tax rate for many years, but that's not the only reason that companies come to Ireland."" The German and French leaders pledged on Wednesday to step up efforts to recover more funds from global companies. ""We will work toward ensuring companies have to pay more where they are based,"" Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said at a news conference after the meeting. François Hollande, the French president, told a news conference that Europe should unite to combat profit-shifting by large corporations. ""We cannot accept that a certain number of companies can put themselves in situations where they escape paying taxes in ways that are legal today,"" Mr. Hollande said. ""We must coordinate at a European level, harmonize our rules and come up with strategies to stop this.""

1392,1520271095.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  The effort to remake the intelligence relationship between the United States and Germany after it was disclosed last year that the National Security Agency was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone has collapsed, according to German officials, who say there will be no broad intelligence sharing or ""no-spy"" agreement between the two countries when Ms. Merkel arrives at the White House on Friday.  The failure to reach a broader accord has led to some bitter recriminations on both sides, with sharply diverging accounts from officials in Berlin and Washington about who was responsible for what was supposed to be a political solution to an embarrassing disclosure. But it also raises broader questions at a moment that President Obama and Ms. Merkel will attempt to show that they are in general accord on a strategy for both punishing Russia for its actions in Ukraine and containing President Vladimir V. Putin in the years ahead.  The effort to remain in step, at a time of significant disagreements within the European alliance about how to respond to Russia, is ""going to put our intelligence relationships to the kind of test we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War,"" a senior administration official said this week.  Just before she left Berlin for Washington on Thursday, Ms. Merkel talked by phone with Mr. Putin, urging the release of a German-led team of military observers -- four Germans, a Pole, a Czech and a Dane -- who have been held almost a week in the Ukrainian town of Slovyansk, one of a dozen or so east Ukrainian cities where pro-Russian militants have assumed control. The fact that the observers are still being held -- to growing consternation in Berlin -- has suggested to some in the West and in Ukraine that Mr. Putin, who in general values relations with Germany, is either unable or unwilling to intervene. While the disclosure that the N.S.A. had listened to Ms. Merkel's conversations for more than a decade was a passing story in the United States -- one of many from the files that Edward J. Snowden took with him when he left Hawaii with the agency's crown jewels -- it has remained an issue in Germany. After the disclosure, Mr. Obama said the United States would not monitor Ms. Merkel's communications, but he made no such commitment for any other German officials. And he said nothing about the future of the N.S.A.'s operations in Germany, including whether a listening station based in the American Embassy in Berlin, would stay intact. For a number of months, German officials said the chancellor could not visit Washington until there was a resolution, including what they called a ""restoration of trust"" between the allies.  But the talks hit the rocks as soon as they began. Germany demanded a no-spy agreement that would ban the United States from conducting espionage activities on its soil. That led to a series of tough exchanges between the president's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, and her German counterpart, Christoph Heusgen.  Ms. Rice, according to American officials, said that the United States did not have no-spy agreements with any of its close allies, even with the other members of the so-called Five Eyes -- the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- which share virtually all of their intelligence. She said any such agreement with Germany would set a precedent that every other major European ally, along with the Japanese, the South Koreans and others, would soon demand to replicate. By the American account of events, German officials decided to proceed with an agreement for enhanced intelligence sharing, a process that consumed the intelligence agencies in both countries, and was presided over by Ms. Rice and Mr. Heusgen. American officials said that in January, the Germans terminated those talks, saying that if an accord could not include a no-spy agreement -- a political necessity for Ms. Merkel -- it was not worth signing.  ""We were ready to conclude an agreement about intelligence cooperation that reiterated key principles about our collection activities around the time of the president's January speech"" that put new limits on the N.S.A.'s activities, a senior administration official said. ""But it was the German government who told us they no longer wanted to proceed, not the other way around."" ""They pulled the plug,"" another official said. ""What the Germans want, and wanted, is that we would never do anything against their laws on their territory."" That is an agreement the United States ""has with no country,"" the official said.  Any monitoring from German soil -- including from the United States Embassy -- would constitute a violation of German law.  ""Our positions and those of the U.S. lie quite far apart, that is quite obvious,"" Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Wednesday. He added that Germany stood by ""the demand that on German soil the German laws must be respected, and by everybody."" Then, he added: ""But it is a long political process."" Mr. Seibert's explanation to the German press was that a no-spy agreement and enhanced cooperation between the two country's intelligence agencies was first proposed as ""an offer which came in last year from the U.S."" He said that is ""not being followed up on"" by the Obama administration. American officials say the concept originated with German officials in an effort to respond to the political uproar caused by the Snowden disclosure. ""There is huge hypocrisy here,"" said one senior intelligence official, who would not talk on the record about intelligence issues. ""Allies spy on each other -- that's not exactly news. And Germany makes huge use of what we provide them from our infrastructure in Europe and around the world. Yet they had to respond to the outrage.""  It is unclear how the disagreement may figure in talks between Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel. But Mr. Obama is intent on closing the chapter that involved the revelation of N.S.A. spying on the chancellor -- something Obama and Bush administration officials insist they did not know about -- and focusing on Ukraine. Ms. Merkel's government will also report Friday to a parliamentary commission on the Snowden disclosures. Its report is expected to say that Mr. Snowden will not be called to testify in Germany about the conclusions he reached. A German newspaper, The Süddeutsche Zeitung, quoted a document from German officials as saying that inviting Mr. Snowden, who is wanted on criminal charges in the United States, to Germany would put a ""permanent strain"" on relations with Washington.

1251,1722613212.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. WARSAW -- Hungary closed its border with Croatia early Saturday to stem the flow of thousands of migrants who had been making their way into the heart of Europe -- just over a day after European Union leaders failed to reach a deal to seal the bloc's outer borders. The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told reporters in Budapest on Friday that his country was taking the action for two reasons: it had finally completed a razor-wire fence along the 216-mile border and, more crucially, because the European Union had yet to come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the flow of migrants. For the last month, a migrant trail has operated freely, with countries along the route from the Balkans to Germany allowing those seeking asylum to pass through their territories -- as long as they either applied for asylum or exited on the other end. The arrangement has helped to avert the kind of humanitarian crises that erupted in Central Europe in late August and early September, when migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere began pouring into the Balkans in huge numbers. Hungary's unilateral move threatened to upend the situation, but other countries in the region quickly said they were prepared to take up the slack -- for the time being. Officials in Croatia, which had been moving thousands of migrants into Hungary since that country had closed its border with Serbia a month ago, said they simply would shift the human flow west, into Slovenia, which had been preparing for such an eventuality. Croatia and Slovenia insisted, though, that they would be forced to close their borders, too, if Austria and Germany decided to stop accepting the migrants. Slovenian officials said that while they could not accept an endless human surge, they had built the capacity to move as many as 6,000 migrants a day into Austria, and would continue to do so as long as the path remained open. Speaking after a meeting of the Hungarian national security committee on Friday afternoon, Mr. Szijjarto said the government had alerted Croatia, as well as Austria, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, about its decision to close the border. ""The important thing is we expected this to happen and we are prepared for it,"" said Slovenia's foreign minister, Karl Erjavec. ""Our goal is to assure security and order at our national borders and at the E.U. border and, at the same time, offer migrants a proper, humane treatment."" Croatian officials, though, worried that Hungary's move would cause a ""chain reaction"" of neighboring countries also blocking migrants. ""If Austria closes its border, then Croatia must close its border, as well,"" said Croatia's foreign minister, Vesna Pusic. Hungary approved the plan to close the crossing after European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to improve border controls and backed a deal with Turkey intended to slow the influx of migrants into Europe. But the deal with Turkey was not made final, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is headed to Istanbul this weekend to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to try to reach an agreement. Aid groups and refugee officials have warned for months that the closing of any borders between Greece, where many of the migrants first enter Europe, and their intended destinations in Germany, Sweden or elsewhere will quickly cause a backup at borders along the so-called West Balkan route. That would lead to new encampments of stranded migrants behind blocked borders. Hungary closed its nearly 109-mile border with Serbia last month after more than 350,000 migrants entered the country this year through the West Balkans, en route to Germany and other destinations. As a result, the migrant flow shifted west, into Croatia, and until now people had been allowed to register and cross the Hungarian border on their way to Austria and beyond. Slovenia has built 12 reception centers, with up to 7,500 beds. With winter approaching, the country is also scrambling to find sufficient heated accommodations for the migrants should they be delayed on their journey to Austria. For months, Hungarian officials had complained that the failure of Greece, the migrants' initial entry point, to control the human flow has shifted the burden to Hungary and other European Union nations. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary has repeatedly called for a multinational European effort to intercept refugees at the Greek border rather than dealing with the influx piecemeal, at borders throughout the Balkans and Central Europe. So far, the proposal has found no widespread support in Brussels. ""The European Council meeting has not resulted in any decision that would provide for defending the common borders of the European Union with European forces,"" said Mr. Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister. If Hungary follows the same policy it has put in place on the Serbian border, any migrants caught crossing the border or tampering with the fence would be arrested and subject to years in prison. Official border crossings would remain open, but migrants seeking to cross would be sent to a transit zone adjacent to the border to begin the long process of applying for asylum. Hungary plans to open two such transit zones along its border with Croatia. Two transit zones are already in operation on Hungary's border with Serbia, but only about 500 refugees have tried to use them, said Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hungary. Implementing a similar policy on the Croatian border would mean that no more people would be allowed through, Mr. Baloch said. ""This is not going to end the crisis or the number of people who are trying to seek safety in Europe,"" he said. ""It may reroute the population somewhere else, but this is not the final answer."" United Nations officials in Geneva have said that Europe needs to act quickly to develop reception centers and accelerate the relocation of asylum seekers, as its refugee agency on the Greek island of Lesbos is struggling with a surge in migrants crossing the narrow waterway between the island and Turkey. European leaders agreed at a summit meeting on Sept. 22 to spread 120,000 asylum seekers around Europe, even to countries that do not want them, and to set up ""hot spots"" to quicken the process of registering and moving migrants. But United Nations officials say the reception system continues to be overwhelmed. ""This is not a crisis at the moment that is adequately managed,"" Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in Geneva. ""What's needed is rapid implementation of what has been agreed."" About 85 boats landed on Lesbos on Wednesday, and similar numbers arrived on Thursday and Friday, according to representatives of the refugee agency. They reported seeing up to six boats arriving at a time, most of them rubber dinghies carrying about 50 people each. The refugee agency temporarily evacuated the registration facilities at Moria, outside the island's capital, Mytilene, after an outbreak of violence among the thousands of migrants who line up there, sometimes for days. More than 450,000 refugees and migrants have reached Greece by boat this year, Mr. Edwards said, adding that Europe must act quickly to set up proper reception centers. The reasons for the current spike in arrivals are unclear, but Mr. Edwards cited a slight improvement in weather, and a rush to reach Europe before winter sets in or its borders close. Fresh fighting in Syria may also have spurred more people to flee. European leaders who gathered in Brussels on Thursday did not endorse calling in troops to slow the flow of migrants but did agree on measures to achieve the same end. Those included the deployment of hundreds of border guards from across Europe to help Greece manage its borders and a sharp expansion in the powers and resources of Frontex, the union's previously largely powerless border agency. ""We don't know for certain what went on at the European Council meeting, but I have to guess that Orban and his team must have concluded that a decision on protecting the European Union's external border or a deal with Turkey were still far-off,"" said Attila Tibor Nagy, an analyst at the Center for Fair Political Analysis, a research group in Budapest. At the same time, Mr. Nagy said, Mr. Orban felt pressure to follow through on promises he had made to Hungarians over the summer to crack down on the migrants after his government mounted an aggressive anti-immigrant campaign.

1434,1372739325.xml,"       Bless the Borrowers Robert Kuttner champions the cause of indebted students, families and states. DEBTORS' PRISON The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility By Robert Kuttner 331 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. ROBERT KUTTNER'S title refers, first, to the ""medieval institution"" that was the fate of improvident souls in England who could not repay their debts, including Daniel Defoe. In 1692, Defoe was committed to King's Bench Prison in London, where he began to agitate for a change in the legal system. Forcing debtors to rot, Defoe not disinterestedly pointed out, was injurious to both parties, since ""after a debtor was confined in prison both he and the creditor lost through his distress."" Society responded, eventually, with bankruptcy laws, but it is very much Kuttner's point in ""Debtors' Prison"" that we - America and Europe in the age of the financial crisis - have yet to absorb the principal lesson of Defoe's ""bitter experience."" The contemporary prison Kuttner has in mind is the policies and practices of central banks, governments, international finance agencies and Wall Street that add up to a state of nonforgiveness. The debtors he would like to spring from their figurative King's Bench include Americans with underwater mortgages, sovereign realms like Greece, overborrowed college students and just about any institution (save for big banks) with a marker coming due. As his subtitle makes clear, Kuttner's crusade is not just for debt forgiveness but for budgetary largess as well. Enforcing austerity on bankrupt states has become routine, our financial penicillin. Kuttner says the pill is just as self-defeating as tossing debtors in jail. He is angry at Barack Obama for embracing what he terms austerity, the president's formerly trillion-dollar deficits notwithstanding, and for not providing large-scale mortgage relief à la Franklin Roosevelt. While his complaints echo those of others on the left, Kuttner's thesis is girded to a historical narrative that yields a coherent, readable and highly impassioned book. The history that concerns him is an abbreviated version of the 20th century: first there was World War I. The winners of that war - despite the urgent warnings of J. M. Keynes - shackled Germany with reparations. England and France, meanwhile, were saddled with their own enormous debts. Austerity did not work out very well. Thus we got the Great Depression. The 1930s, by contrast, were an age of enlightenment. Kuttner, a scarily prolific writer and a co-editor of The American Prospect, lauds the New Deal for its sundry generosities, including publicly financed mortgages, although, he grants, they did not quite end the Depression. Then came World War II. The postwar leadership he likes even more than the Roosevelt administration. Germany was forgiven its Nazi-era debt, while international financing was plentiful and cheap. Bretton Woods kept currencies stable and speculators at bay, and no one worried much that United States debt ballooned during the war. Kuttner's point is that postwar liberalism spawned prosperity. Things went sour, he suggests, when government controls - on capital, on interest rates, on currencies - gave way to rule by markets. Europe and the United States both ditched the welfare state and adopted the neoliberal tendencies of Washington. In a fatal step, Germany, as a price for sharing a currency, demanded austerity from the rest of Europe; it even insisted that Greek civil servants work past their 50s. The German-dominated European Central Bank turned bailouts into a ""morality play,"" ceaselessly haggling for harsher terms for debtors. Kuttner minimizes the responsibility of European welfare states for their own distress. Conversely, he is tough on Germany - which he says should remember that onerous debts do not always lead to happy results. He finds it unreasonable that Chancellor Angela Merkel did not grant Athens the same scale of charity that her country meted out to the former East Germany, and he accuses Berlin of being a bully, a ""financial hegemon."" To these ears, he goes too far. When Kuttner writes, ""German characterizations of Greece ... range from patronizing to vicious - and they do not sound pretty in a German accent,"" one might ask, with what accent does he find them attractive? Perhaps Chinese. He is admiring of China, whose hegemonic tendencies he ignores, for refusing to expose its currency to markets. Beijing, he blithely observes, ""takes the long view."" In contrast, he excoriates Poland for embracing low taxes, deregulation and other free-market nostrums. Such policies, Kuttner writes, ""helped Poland and other nations achieve good growth rates, but it puts severe pressure on the traditional welfare states of Western Europe"" to lower their taxes and social protections. That Poland should stay poor so Europe can remain socialized is among Kuttner's stranger suggestions. Kuttner is a political economist, a sadly atrophied profession. The modern economist employs mathematics as a badge of neutrality. Kuttner wants nothing of neutrality; he parades his politics for all to see. He views society as tilted too far toward creditors, not just among nations but in the everyday exchanges between consumers and banks. He aims to shift power to borrowers and to states, letting governments happily print money as they will. To Kuttner, Paul Volcker is no hero. Volcker, of course, tamed inflation, and inflation is kind to debtors, though it is unkind to everyone else. Kuttner is nostalgic not only for inflation but, it seems, even for ""negative real interest rates"" - the condition under which capital fetches no return. Since the '80s, he maintains, capital has been overrewarded and a comeuppance is due. In general, he sees markets not as mediating a balance between supply and demand but as favoring one constituency over another. Kuttner laments the opening of labor markets in Europe as benefiting corporations at workers' expense. Adam Smith might respond that if a Greek can find employment in Düsseldorf, both parties benefit. Progress is lumpy and uneven - but as Smith observed, over time the Invisible Hand disperses its blessings. Kuttner rejects this classical view with an inflammatory call-to-arms: ""We need to take the power back."" Many of Kuttner's particulars ring true: finance in America reached a point of complexity that benefited only traders; short-term loans destabilize developing countries; markets need regulation or they go off the rails. But his sweeping premises are dubious. America's postwar boom was a result of Europe and Japan's crippled condition, not just of debt forgiveness. Declining American wage growth in the '70s resulted mainly from our allies' competitive resurgence, not from rightward politics. Similarly, Kuttner's historical contrasts seem stretched. He compares the foreclosed farmers of the 1930s to overmortgaged households of today, but today's mortgage holders are not uniformly ""victims."" Many were exploited, but a good many willfully speculated or lied on their mortgage applications. And it is highly misleading to say that America's budget deficit during World War II was ""more than double the level that led to a run on Greek sovereign debt."" Greece's total debt peaked at a reported 170 percent of its gross domestic product - America's didn't get close to that level. Moreover, Greece's debt was accumulated in support of a bankrupt statist model that demanded reform. America's war borrowing was huge but temporary. Kuttner wants more deficit spending in the United States because, he says, America remains imprisoned in a debt trap. The recovery in real estate suggests that his timing could be off. To his credit, Kuttner challenges one's preconceptions. I wish his political economy were more receptive to capitalism, but here are two large points I agree with. One, the United States financial meltdown was mostly a product of market excesses, not those of government. Two, austerity in the midst of crisis - as Europe increasingly seems to be reckoning - makes no sense. The charge that ""austerity mongers"" on the Continent have been standing guard over a new debtors' prison cannot be easily dismissed.

1181,868748994.xml,"      DEAUVILLE, France -- President Obama tried to marshal global economic support for Egypt and Tunisia at a gathering of industrialized countries on Thursday, even as some European allies were privately urging him to increase the United States' role in the military campaign in Libya.   These crosscutting pressures show the complexity of the Arab upheaval and the responses it is drawing from major powers. While the United States is emphasizing the need to stabilize the economy of Egypt, its major Arab ally, France and Britain are eager to intensify the NATO airstrikes on Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.   These goals are not mutually exclusive, American and European officials said. The United States said it expected the Group of 8 countries -- France and Britain, among them -- to express strong support for efforts to generate jobs and revive growth in Arab countries.   ""Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy, a number of leaders, have all stressed the importance of using these meetings to show a unified front in providing support for Egypt and Tunisia,"" Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser, said of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.   Libya and the Arab world dominated the meeting of world leaders in this fashionable seaside resort in Normandy. Mr. Sarkozy, the host, is still pushing for the United States to deploy A-10 attack aircraft and AC-130 gunships in Libya, said a French official, though he said Mr. Sarkozy was making his pitch privately.   At a news conference here, the French president reiterated his call for Colonel Qaddafi to relinquish power. ""We're not saying he should go into exile,"" Mr. Sarkozy said. But he ""cannot stay in power.""   Mr. Obama, who has rejected calls for more combat aircraft, is trying to keep the focus on economic stability and jobs in Egypt and Tunisia. At the same time, he is relying on European governments and international financial institutions to supply much of the capital.   Prime Minister David Cameron told Mr. Obama on Wednesday that Britain would support the effort, and it would pledge $178 million. American officials said they had gotten encouraging signs from Germany and France, even if neither has made a concrete pledge.   The International Monetary Fund, which has had a team in Egypt for the last week, is readying a package worth $4 billion to $5 billion to help it bridge a financing gap, a fund official said. Egyptian officials said their economy, damaged by unrest that halted trade and tourism, will need an infusion of $12 billion just this year to steady itself.   Last week, Mr. Obama announced $1 billion of debt relief and $1 billion in loan guarantees for Egypt. The European Union plans to increase its aid by $1.75 billion.    The United States and Europe have played down expectations of a big dollar total, saying this is not a pledging conference. That partly reflects the bitter experience of past summit meetings, where tens of billions of dollars were pledged to alleviate poverty and many countries dragged their feet in delivering on their promises.   It also reflects the fact that the most cash-rich countries -- as well as the ones with the most incentive to support stable Arab countries -- are their neighbors in the Persian Gulf. The Obama administration is focusing much of its efforts on persuading Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries to make pledges to Egypt and Tunisia, officials said.   The Group of 8 is also expected to take a harsh stand against Syria's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, officials said. That may require some arm-twisting, however, since Russia has opposed efforts to impose United Nations sanctions on the Syrian government.   Conceding those differences, Mr. Rhodes said, ""We want to have a strong and unified voice that we're speaking with our allies and all who share concerns for the rights of the Syrian people.""    The Libyan campaign was high on the agenda when Mr. Obama met for 90 minutes with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. But they also discussed Russia's bid to enter the World Trade Organization and efforts to settle disagreements over the deployment of an American missile-defense system in Eastern Europe.   Russia is less bitterly opposed to missile defense than it was a year ago, an American official said. But he said the Russians remained suspicious that the most advanced version of the system -- not scheduled to be deployed until 2020 -- would threaten their nuclear defenses.   ""They have a perception that when we get to that phase, that there may be some capability to threaten what we call strategic stability,"" said Michael McFaul, senior director for Russia at the National Security Council. ""We have no intention of doing that.""   Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Obama appeared stern-faced after their session, but American officials insisted it went well. Their expressions, one said, reflected only the stuffiness of the room.   Despite much anticipation, the leadership void at the I.M.F. did not figure much in hallway chatter. The French government is promoting its finance minister, Christine Lagarde, as a candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been charged with the sexual assault of a hotel maid in New York.   The Obama administration remains noncommittal on her candidacy, saying only that it wants the most qualified person. But a French official said he was confident that Ms. Lagarde, who did not attend the meeting, had amassed enough support to win the managing director post.

4151,1781290930.xml,"       BERLIN -- THOUGH it's a fact often overlooked by the rest of the world, Germany is a funny place -- seriously. Long before Jon Stewart and Samantha Bee redefined topical American humor, comedians here perfected the art of sharp political satire. For the most part, German politicians get the joke. But now politics and humor are colliding in a new way -- a collision that exposes the tragicomedy of modern Europe. A few weeks ago, the German TV program ""extra3"" satirized Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in song, which prompted the Turkish government to call in the German ambassador to Ankara for a lecture, presumably, on its views regarding the limits of free speech. Not long after, the comedian Jan Böhmermann, satirizing the ensuing debate over what is allowed in political humor, read a poem on his own show, ""Neo Magazin Royale."" The poem, which he read in front of a Turkish flag, was about Mr. Erdogan and, among other things, what he might do with goats. It was a blunt provocation with an intelligent twist. In response, Turkey demanded that the German government allow the prosecution of Mr. Böhmermann under an obscure law against insulting a foreign head of state. On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel granted the request, clearing the path for criminal proceedings. Journalists, labor union representatives and prominent politicians, including Ms. Merkel's coalition partner the Social Democrats, immediately criticized her decision. ""Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of the crisis has been abysmal and shows that she is losing her grip on power,"" wrote the newsmagazine Der Spiegel. Why would Ms. Merkel choose Mr. Erdogan over her own citizens' free speech? One reason: the recent agreement between the European Union and Turkey to stanch the flow of refugees entering the Continent. Under the accord, those caught crossing the sea between Turkey and the Greek islands are now sent back in exchange for a payment of three billion euros and Europe's commitment to take in up to 72,000 additional Syrian refugees. The arrangement was supposed to solve everything: a relatively humanitarian answer that would tamp down far-right sentiment in Germany and appease Turkey, at little cost to the chancellor. It was a model of political realism -- with a touch of political cynicism. As Chancellor Merkel saw it, the alternative to sending back the refugees was political inertia at best, political cataclysm at worst. But what seemed like a policy breakthrough became a political albatross. Had Ms. Merkel refused to prosecute Mr. Böhmermann, Turkey could have pulled out of the deal. She has opted for the second, bad option, sullying her own liberal virtues. Mr. Böhmermann got what he wanted; the clown has shown the powerful just how powerless they can be. But the affair also highlights the flaws of the Turkey deal itself. First, there's the calculation that bowing to the interests of the Turkish government was a fair price for tamping down the far right. But national support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party remains strong, despite decreasing numbers of refugees. Ms. Merkel has won some respite from critics within her own party, but the deal has opened a new front, with the center left attacking her for acquiescing to Mr. Erdogan's demands. Nor does it work as policy. There are still hundreds of thousands of refugees in Europe and many more on the way, and still there is no agreement on how to share the burden across the Continent. Meanwhile, human traffickers are beginning to build new routes over Libya to Italy. But what the Böhmermann affair shows most impressively is that the deal was struck for the wrong reasons at the wrong time. It was a panic reaction. Ms. Merkel was under immense political pressure; her party, the Christian Democrats, had just suffered setbacks in three state elections. Other European leaders are facing similar problems. Europe came to the table quarreling and desperate -- not as a partner, but as a beggar. Now Mr. Erdogan continues to treat Europe as such. Political realists love to cite game theory to justify their decisions; had they cracked open their textbooks for a refresher, they could have easily predicted this outcome. Of course, the alternative cannot be to ignore Turkey; the refugee crisis has moved the world's conflicts to our doorsteps. Germany -- and Europe -- need Turkey. And Germany and Europe will probably have to strike more than one deal with Turkey in the future, and will have to cooperate with autocratic states on many other issues. Even the center-right Christian Democrats, who have mostly blocked Turkey's path to the European Union, even when Mr. Erdogan was still on a fairly liberal course, are finally recognizing this reality, which is for the good. But the moral of this story about being less moralistic is this: If you are divided and weak, it doesn't make sense to put on a strongman act in foreign policy. Let's hope that next time the clown not only humbles the mighty, but also enlightens them. This article has been updated to reflect news developments.

414,2436754668.xml,"Once again, a prominent critic of Moscow has mysteriously fallen ill. And once again, poison appears to be the culprit.BERLIN -- Aleksei A. Navalny, the outspoken Russian dissident who fell into a coma last week, was a victim of poisoning, German doctors said Monday, adding him to the ranks of Russians stricken by mystery illness after drawing the wrath of Moscow.Mr. Navalny, who became ill on a domestic flight in Russia, was under round-the-clock guard at the Berlin hospital where his family transferred him Saturday after what now appears to be yet another attack signaling Russia's status as an outlaw nation.While not able to pinpoint the exact poison, German doctors said tests showed it came from a group of chemicals known as cholinesterase inhibitors, which interfere with the nervous system. While they are used medically to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, in some forms they are also found in chemical weapons and pesticides.A Russian health ministry issued a statement challenging the German findings, saying Mr. Navalny's symptoms were not consistent with cholinesterase inhibitors. But a doctor at the Siberian hospital where the dissident was initially taken said after the German announcement that the patient had been given an antidote often used against nerve agents.A state news agency, RIA, carried a statement from a pro-Kremlin group that took the opportunity to invoke World War II. The group, Strong Russia, criticized the German government for providing treatment for Mr. Navalny but not for elderly Russians who suffered as children during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.""Of course, as with any sick person, we wish Navalny a quick recovery,"" the statement said. ""Has Berlin ever sent an air ambulance for a former detainee in the concentration camps?""German doctors said that they expected Mr. Navalny to survive. but that it was too early to gauge the long-term effects of the attack.Mr. Navalny, who has challenged President Vladimir V. Putin politically for nearly a decade, and has waged a long battle to publicize rampant official corruption, has been attacked at least twice before. One assault left him mostly blind in one eye.This time, he fell ill while returning from a trip to Siberia, where he was organizing opposition candidates and strategy for regional and local elections. His plane made an emergency landing in the Siberian city of Omsk, where he was taken to a local hospital.Mr. Navalny's family and supporters organized an air ambulance to take him to Germany, but Russian doctors delayed for nearly 48 hours, saying his medical condition was too unstable for him to be moved. That drew bitter criticism from the Navalny camp, which accused the doctors of stalling to give the toxins enough time to drain from his system.Mr. Navalny was flown to Germany at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though Germany enjoys strong economic and cultural ties to Russia, it has not shied from criticizing Mr. Putin's policies, and even before Mr. Navalny arrived in Berlin, the German government appeared to be taking extra precautions to ensure his safety.After the doctors declared the case a poisoning, Ms. Merkel and her foreign minister, Heiko Maas, called on Russia to launch an immediate investigation but did not offer any harsher criticism.""Given Mr. Navalny's prominent role in Russia's political opposition, the authorities there are now urgently called upon to investigate this crime to the last detail -- and to do so in full transparency,"" they said in a statement. ""Those responsible must be identified and held accountable.""Minutes before landing, his plane was rerouted from Schönefeld Airport to Tegel Airport, and the ambulance that brought him from the tarmac to the Charité hospital was escorted by the police. A police van and several officers have been stationed outside the hospital's main entrance since Saturday.""It was clear that after he arrived here, security measures had to be put in place,"" Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters on Monday, before the hospital released its statement. ""We are dealing with a patient who appears, with a certain level of probability, to have been the target of a poisoning attack.""""Unfortunately,"" Mr. Seibert noted, ""there are one or more examples of such poisonings in recent Russian history.""The Russian security services are suspected of having used a range of poisons in attempts to eliminate opponents, although Russian officials have consistently denied it.Many of those victims have been stricken after drinking tea.Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist, fell ill after taking a cup of tea on a domestic flight. She survived, but was shot and killed in her apartment elevator two years later.A former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic Alexander V. Litvinenko, succumbed after ingesting a radioactive isotope, Polonium 210, while having tea with two Russian agents. British investigators later determined that the killing had most likely been ordered by Mr. Putin.Mr. Navalny, too, drank a cup of tea before falling ill, at an airport cafe before departure.Numerous, less prominent figures have been felled under mysterious circumstances. In March 2018, a former Russian spy named Sergei V. Skripal was found poisoned on a park bench in Salisbury, England, alongside his unconscious daughter. Both survived.Sometimes, though, the weapon is not very mysterious.In 2015, one of the most high-profile Putin critics, Boris Y. Nemtsov, was gunned down just a stone's throw from the Kremlin. And last August, an assassin riding a bicycle shot and killed a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park; German officials suspect Russia was behind the killing, but Moscow has denied responsibility.While miscellaneous hit men have been charged in some of the killings, those giving the orders have never been identified.For the last decade, Mr. Navalny has been Mr. Putin's most unflinching critic, leading opposition rallies and publishing reports on high-level corruption among Mr. Putin and his cronies -- most memorably a lengthy video showing the multiple mega-properties, yachts and other luxuries amassed up by the former prime minister Dimitri A. Medvedev.Having persevered despite numerous arrests, he likes to call Mr. Putin's political party the party of ""scoundrels and thieves"" and has accused the president of trying to turn Russia into a ""feudal state.""Mr. Navalny's needling criticism of Mr. Putin has never posed a serious electoral threat to the Russian leader, and Mr. Putin remains popular with many Russians. But Mr. Navalny has dominated Russian opposition politics since he led large antigovernment street protests in 2011.And Mr. Navalny cannily used social media to build a tenacious movement even after much of the independent news media had been squelched and other critics were driven into exile or killed.Like the German doctors, the Russian doctors who initially treated Mr. Navalny said they had looked at poisoning as the cause for his sudden collapse. Then they ruled it out, they said.""Of course, we will sort this out,"" Anatoly Kalinichenko, the deputy head doctor of the Siberian hospital where Mr. Navalny was treated, said of the German findings. ""Did we make a mistake, or did the laboratories, or is all of this disinformation?"" he said.Another doctor who consulted on Mr. Navalny's treatment in Siberia, Boris Teplykh, said the medical team had in fact considered a poison in the class of chemicals identified by the Germans, which includes nerve agents.They ruled it out, he said -- but before doing so had injected Mr. Navalny with an antidote for nerve toxins, atropine. German doctors said Monday they had also begun atropine treatment.""Concerning atropine, which our colleagues prescribed for treatment, well, in the first minutes after arrival injections with this substance were made,"" Dr. Teplykh told the news agency Interfax.While Mr. Navalny was still in Russia, the hospital's head doctor, Aleksandr Murakhovsky, released a statement offering a different diagnosis. He said Mr. Navalny was most likely suffering from a metabolic disorder brought on by low blood sugar.Men who appeared to be with the security services but were not in uniform had milled about the hospital hallways, and came and went from Dr. Murakhovsky's office, videos and pictures showed.Their presence alarmed Mr. Navalny's wife, his personal physician and a spokeswoman, who said they worried the security services were dictating his care.Asked about these plainclothes men in his office, Dr. Murakhovsky said that he did not know who they were, but that they had not influenced his treatment decisions.""I had a lot of people in my office, but I cannot say what they were doing there,"" he said. ""They came and asked, 'Is everything all right?' And I said, 'Everything is all right.' And they left.""They were just interested.""Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin and Andrew E.

585,2468546235.xml,"A day after the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine began in Britain and a day before its possible approval in the United States, Canada authorized the drug on Wednesday. But Britain, which approved the same vaccine last week, sounded a slight note of caution.Drug regulators said that, for now, people with severe allergies should not take the vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The British regulators are investigating allergic reactions in two health care workers who were given the first of two doses of the drug on Tuesday. Both workers had histories of serious allergies and carried epinephrine pens, the generic term for EpiPens, to counter symptoms of a condition called anaphylaxis, like hives, swelling and decreasing blood pressure.Another vaccine showed promise: A Chinese vaccine was said to be 86 percent effective. The announcement came from the United Arab Emirates, where trials were conducted. But the announcement was met with silence from the vaccine's manufacturer, Sinopharm. The Emirates' Ministry of Health and Prevention said it had reviewed an interim analysis by the manufacturer but did not indicate whether it had conducted its own analysis of the data.In the United States, the swell of cases continued. On Tuesday, 23 states hit seven-day highs for new cases, and 10 recorded seven-day records for deaths. Case numbers have fallen in some Midwestern states, but those declines have been more than offset by uncontrolled outbreaks in some of the country's largest cities. The Miami and Los Angeles areas have added thousands of cases each day for the past week. And in Pennsylvania, which set new one-day highs on five days this month, Gov. Tom Wolf announced that he was among the 451,000 Pennsylvanians who have contracted the virus. He said on Twitter that he had tested positive, ""a reminder that no one is immune from Covid.""""Following all precautions, as I have done, is not a guarantee,"" he said, ""but it is what we know to be vital to stopping the spread of the disease."" Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, is at least the ninth governor to report receiving a positive test result. The first was Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, in mid-July.XXXResistance to restrictions in the United States continues. Some California towns have rebelled against restrictions on restaurants by forming their own health departments. Among them are Beverly Hills, where Mayor Lester Friedman said the county had ""lost touch"" with Angelenos, and Hawaiian Gardens, a working-class Latino hamlet where a casino that is the community's main employer and source of revenue was closed by a county order.In New York City, most restaurant owners have abided by the state's ever-changing coronavirus regulations. But the owner and the manager of a bar on Staten Island did not comply with the rules, staying open late in defiance of a 10 p.m. curfew. Nor did the bar, Mac's Public House, close when it was shuttered by the state last Wednesday.Tensions between the bar and officials escalated on Saturday night, when deputies showed up and saw that the bar was still operating. The manager, Danny Presti, tried to flee in his Jeep and hit a sheriff's deputy, the authorities said. Mr. Presti's lawyers said he did not know who was confronting him in the dark. Mr. Presti was arrested and released on his own recognizance.In Idaho, masks were the flash point. A regional health board had been expected to vote on a four-county mask mandate on Tuesday, but after about 12 minutes officials adjourned the meeting because of protests, not only outside the building where the session was taking place but also at some officials' homes. The district director, Russell A. Duke, told board members that Mayor Lauren McLean and the Boise Police Department had asked them to end the meeting in the interest of public safety.That was several minutes after one board member, Diana Lachiondo, a commissioner from Ada County, which includes Boise, left after saying a neighbor had texted her about demonstrators at her house. ""My 12-year-old son is home by himself right now, and there are protesters banging outside the door,"" she said. She later tweeted that they were fine.News outlets said hundreds of protesters gathered in the parking lot outside the Central District Health building, and the police said one person was arrested for refusing to leave the scene. Some accounts said the protesters included people associated with a group established by Ammon Bundy, who led an armed takeover of an Oregon wildlife refuge in 2016 and tangled with officials in the western Idaho town of Caldwell in October when he refused to wear a mask at a high school football game.Gov. Brad Little of Idaho, a Republican, has repeatedly urged Idahoans to wear masks but has left it to regional health boards to make mask-wearing a requirement. He called the protests at the board members' homes ""reprehensible"" and ""nothing more than a bullying tactic that seeks to silence.""XXXAfter Germany reported its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day -- 590 -- Chancellor Angela Merkel all but said that month-old partial restrictions had not been enough. Ms. Merkel has often been thwarted by squabbling among Germany's 16 state governments. Last month, they agreed to only limited restrictions that were mocked as ""lockdown light"" because stores, schools and workplaces were allowed to remain open.The case counts and death toll have not come down. As many Germans died of the coronavirus in the first seven days of December as did in traffic accidents in all of 2019, according to a report by the German National Academy of Sciences, which has recommended a strict lockdown after Christmas. Germany's seven-day average for new cases climbed to 19,112 on Tuesday, a record that was nearly three and a half times the seven-day peak in April, when the first wave was cresting.""What will people say, looking back at a once-in-a-century event, if we can't find a solution"" for the next few weeks, Ms. Merkel asked. ""If we have too many contacts before Christmas and then later this becomes the last Christmas we celebrate with our grandparents, then we missed something.""Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-12-10
1256,2568968348.xml,"To listen to the debate in Europe over the chaotic retreat of United States troops from Afghanistan is to be struck by what a huge vocabulary Europeans have developed over the centuries for describing military calamities. What we just witnessed has already been described as a débâcle, a débandade, a dégringolade and a déroute, not to mention a ""rout,"" a ""fiasco"" and a ""humiliation.""The question at the heart of these discussions is whether the botched withdrawal is a failure serious enough to merit a rethinking of European-American defense arrangements. The Afghan war was a NATO operation, involving the core of the trans-Atlantic alliance system that dates from the Cold War. American fecklessness has left European leaders infuriated. In Germany, Armin Laschet, who is running to replace his Christian Democratic colleague Angela Merkel as chancellor in national elections this month, speaks of ""the greatest debacle NATO has suffered since its founding.""Mr. Laschet's assessment reflects more than election-season passions. It is shared in other countries. Bidenesque incompetence comes atop four years of Trumpian contempt. As Adrien Jaulmes, a French war correspondent, recently put it, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have together sent ""a message to the allies and adversaries of the United States that Washington's commitments are only commitments for so long.""There have been moments of mistrust between America and its NATO allies before. But there is a difference today, and it bears on how European leaders are reacting to the Afghan mess. During the Cold War, communism was the issue that polarized continental politics. Europe's governing elites, in their respective countries, were mostly anti-communist. Their instincts were to strengthen ties with the anti-communist United States, whatever their occasional misgivings about American incompetence, overreach or arrogance. And that meant strengthening NATO.Today the issue that divides European publics is the European Union, a superstate-in-embryo to which all but a handful of Western European countries belong. The E.U. project has overlapped with the globalization of the economy and has generated similar debates. Some see it as a source of prosperity and human rights, others as a source of inequality and undemocratic highhandedness.In pretty much every European country, the credentialed, the educated and the empowered want ""more Europe."" They are opposed by defenders of traditional, nation-state-based sovereignty, who want to protect the prerogatives of, say, Berlin or Warsaw against the ambitions of the E.U.'s capital, Brussels. Sociologically, the split is like that between Democrats and Republicans in the United States.Pro-European Union politicians generally look to move governing responsibilities from national capitals to Brussels. The more ambitious among them even seek a measure of military autonomy for the bloc. That would require a rethinking of NATO operating procedures and would almost inevitably bring a loosening of ties with the United States, although E.U. leaders generally deny this when within earshot of Americans.But in the wake of the Afghan debacle, E.U. leaders have begun to air such ambitions. This week, Bernard Guetta, a member of the European Parliament from the party of President Emmanuel Macron of France, called on Europeans to find a geostrategic substitute for an increasingly inward-looking United States. Mr. Macron shows signs of wanting to use recent blunders as a pretext for deploying de-Americanized European fighting units. He told a conference in Baghdad in the wake of the Taliban takeover of Kabul that France would keep its terror-fighting forces in Iraq ""no matter what the Americans do.""Italy and Germany now lean in this direction, too. Late last month, Paolo Gentiloni, a former prime minister of Italy and the current E.U. commissioner for the economy, said, ""It's a terrible paradox, but this debacle could be the start of Europe's moment."" Ms. Merkel has reportedly been part of intra-European discussions about keeping a ""strong temporary presence"" in Kabul.European decision makers have never lacked the ambition for such projects. (In 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France issued a portentous ""Saint-Malo declaration"" calling for an autonomous European strike force.) What they have lacked is a popular consensus for them. Creating an army befitting a superpower is a colossal expense. It makes sense to use the American one as long as it is on offer, rather than bankrupting Europe on a (perhaps quixotic) quest to duplicate it.E.U. elites today also face a challenge of credibility. The bloc's interior ministers spent the first days of this month trying to devise a common migration system to handle a possible large flow of migrants out of Afghanistan. It is a priority, but it was just as much of a priority when migrants were fleeing Syria in the hundreds of thousands in 2015, and the European Union managed no durable solution then.At a time when polls show that Europeans consider immigration their continent's biggest security threat, the European Union's reputation for legalism and dawdling does not spread confidence that it can follow through on even more ambitious projects. On the contrary.That is what proponents of an alternative E.U. defense may have the hardest time facing. Over the past 20 years, Europeans have watched as the United States first led Europe into wars Europe did not want to fight, and then succumbed to a passionate anti-elite politics that culminated in the election of Donald Trump. Frustration is to be expected. The Afghanistan collapse will surely sharpen it.But the European Union is going to find it difficult to place itself at the center of Western defense arrangements, largely because it, too, has generated among its citizenry a distrust for elites as intense as the one that put the United States on its present path. In this respect, at least, Western countries are united, more united perhaps than they would wish to be.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

762,2468948079.xml,"A Kissinger protégé (and a pre-eminent textile art collector), his fingerprints can be found on many of the leading postwar institutions linking the two allies.Guido Goldman, a renaissance man who used his vast wealth and extensive network of friendships in politics and the arts, from Henry A. Kissinger to Harry Belafonte, to help rebuild America's relationship with Germany after World War II, died on Nov. 30 at his home in Concord, Mass. He was 83.His death was confirmed by Karl Kaiser, a close friend and political scientist at Harvard, where Mr. Goldman studied and with which he remained closely affiliated for decades. The cause was prostate cancer.Mr. Goldman's fingerprints can be found on many of the leading postwar academic and cultural institutions linking the United States and Germany, from the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at Harvard, which he founded with his mentors Mr. Kissinger and Stanley Hoffmann, to the German Marshall Fund, which he persuaded Willy Brandt, the chancellor of West Germany, to endow in 1972.But more than any single institution, Mr. Goldman's greatest contribution to trans-Atlantic relations was himself: By all accounts witty, generous and cosmopolitan in his imposing six-foot frame, he was at ease among presidents and chancellors, civil rights leaders and artists -- relationships he drew on to create the sort of person-to-person ties critical to lasting international comity. When the new U.S. Embassy opened in Berlin in 2008, he arranged a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, of which he was a longtime board member.""Guido was an impresario, the honest broker who stayed out of the limelight,"" said Josef Joffe, the publisher-editor of the German newspaper Die Zeit. ""I can't think of anyone like him in our age, when you don't exist if you're not in print or on camera.""Mr. Goldman inherited his larger-than-life stature from his father, Nahum Goldmann, a leading figure in the Zionist movement, and his mother, Alice (Gottschalk) Goldmann, a German painter and heiress to a fortune built on mail-order catalogs -- wealth that later enabled Mr. Goldman to make his early forays into academic philanthropy.He was born in Switzerland, but his father, fearing the long reach of the Nazi regime, moved the family to New York in 1940. Mr. Goldman and his older brother, Michael, were raised in a spacious Upper West Side apartment, where his parents mingled with world leaders, artists and entertainers.""People like Arthur Rubinstein played piano at the Goldmanns', and Eleanor Roosevelt came by for dinner,"" Martin Klingst, the author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Goldman, said in a phone interview.Later, as a student and then a lecturer in government at Harvard, Mr. Goldman drew on his father's connections to establish a long list of research centers, fellowships and endowed chairs, all with a focus on Germany and Europe, ultimately bringing in more than $75 million for the university.In 1971, with the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan fast approaching, the West German government sought out Mr. Goldman's advice on how to commemorate that monumental American effort to help Western Europe recover from World War II. He laid out a plan for a think tank backed by a hefty endowment from Germany, the blueprint for the German Marshall Fund. Mr. Goldman became its first president and board chairman, a position he held for the next four decades.Raised in the traditions of the European educated elite, Mr. Goldman developed passions that ranged far beyond politics.In the mid-1970s he began buying ikat, a textile art -- specifically ikat from early 19th-century Uzbekistan, whose vibrant, abstract colors reminded him of the later works of Wassily Kandinsky, his favorite artist. He eventually amassed one of the world's largest collections of ikat, which he later donated to the Smithsonian and other institutions.He fell equally in love with dance after his brother married a performer with the Alvin Ailey troupe. As a member of the board, Mr. Goldman paid for everything from sprung floors to lawyers to help foreign dancers with visa issues, said Judith Jamison, the former artistic director. ""He really spoiled me silly.""Guido Goldmann was born on Nov. 4, 1937, in Zurich. His parents had fled Berlin after his father, a co-founder and president of the World Jewish Congress, received a tip that the Gestapo had searched his office.Three years later, his father decided to move the family to America, where at some point in the bureaucratic shuffle of immigration, the second ""n"" in Mr. Goldman's name fell off, and he never bothered to replace it. He attended the Birch Wathen School, now the Birch Wathen Lenox School, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, before enrolling at Harvard.Mr. Goldman never married. He is survived by his brother, who lives in Los Angeles.In Manhattan, Mr. Goldman's father, who was also the president of the World Zionist Organization, proved critical in winning support for Israeli independence in the United Nations. He instilled in his sons a commitment to social justice, which led Mr. Goldman to underwrite civil rights activism in the 1960s and '70s.But Mr. Goldman's friends said his parents could be cold and distant toward him -- one reason, they said, that he sought out Mr. Kissinger to be his mentor at Harvard, where Mr. Goldman graduated summa cum laude with a degree in government in 1959 and earned a doctorate in the same field a decade later. Their bond went far beyond that of a professor and a star pupil; Mr. Kissinger himself described it as a ""father-son relationship.""A liberal Democrat, Mr. Goldman did not follow Mr. Kissinger into the Nixon White House. But he remained Mr. Kissinger's confidant, reporting back to him after his frequent trips to West Germany to meet with leading politicians there. He helped Mr. Kissinger in other ways too: He let him stay in his apartment when Mr. Kissinger was in New York, bodyguards in tow, and he even lent him two pieces of art to hang in his office at the White House.""It was a typically Guido thing to do,"" Mr. Kissinger said in a phone interview on Monday. ""Something I didn't ask for, something I didn't know I needed.""Already rich from his mother's inheritance, Mr. Goldman amassed even more wealth during the 1970s and '80s as a real-estate investor and private money manager -- money that he gladly, and often anonymously, dispensed among his friends and people he admired, including civil rights activists like Mr. Belafonte and Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund.""He was one of the most generous connectors of friends and institution creators I've ever encountered,"" Ms. Edelman said.For all his globe-trotting and hobnobbing, his friends said Mr. Goldman was happiest as a dining-table raconteur, telling stories and jokes. Late in the evening, he might bring out a shearling coat he had bought secondhand; it was, he would declare proudly, once owned by Snoop Dogg.""If you were at a dinner party and you found yourself seated next to him, wow, that was your lucky night,"" said Karen Donfried, the president of the German Marshall Fund. ""Every one of us is unique, but there is only one Guido Goldman.""Top, Guido Goldman in 2017. Left, with Judith Jamison, the former artistic director of the Alvin Ailey dance troupe, in 2011.

1488,1711381013.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. BERLIN -- With record numbers of migrants pouring across the Hungarian border and rushing west, Germany, the country that had been the most welcoming in Europe, suddenly ordered temporary border restrictions on Sunday that cut off rail travel from Austria and instituted spot checks on cars. The German move came just one day before European ministers were scheduled to meet in Brussels to discuss a plan to distribute tens of thousands of migrants across Europe, with many governments, particularly in Eastern Europe, bristling at being forced to accept more migrants than they wish to take. The crisis is the latest, and perhaps thorniest, test of Europe's willingness to work together to solve big problems amid rising populist, nationalist and Euro-skeptic movements across the Continent. The restrictions put in place by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government were seen as a strong sign -- if not an outright message -- to other European Union members that Germany was growing weary of shouldering so much of the burden in Europe's largest humanitarian crisis in decades without more help and cooperation from other nations. For others, though, the concern was that if even the richest and most powerful nation in the 28-member union was showing signs of reaching its limit, how would Europe be able to find a path through a seemingly ceaseless refugee emergency? When word of the new restrictions made the rounds at the main station in Salzburg, Austria, the last major stop on the rail journey to Germany, hundreds of migrants were taken off the blocked trains and to a garage nearby, the German Press Agency said. A simple sign was posted on the station's information boards: ""No railway service by order of German authorities due to the German migrant crisis."" Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said that it was ""desperately necessary"" for Germany to limit the number of people coming into the country and ""reinstate an orderly entry process"" after two weeks that left the country straining to accommodate the new arrivals. Although one of the proudest European achievements of recent decades was passport-free travel between most member nations, the rules allow the reinstatement of border restrictions in cases of crisis and national security, he said. ""This measure is also a signal to Europe"" that more needs to be done, and quickly, Mr. de Maizière said. ""Introducing temporary border controls will not solve the whole problem,"" he said. Also on Sunday, Ms. Merkel spoke with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, who proposed a plan last week to relocate 160,000 migrants who are waiting in the main front-line nations of Greece, Italy and Hungary. The proposal, to be discussed Monday in Brussels by the bloc's home affairs ministers, includes 40,000 migrants covered under an earlier plan that collapsed when several member nations refused to accept mandatory quotas of refugees, as well as 120,000 more. Leaders of several countries, including Poland and the Czech Republic, have said they still object to any mandatory quotas, but may be willing to accept more new arrivals as long as it is voluntary. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have been surging into Europe for nearly two years from war-torn areas of the Middle East, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Eritrea and elsewhere in Africa. Many of them aim to reach Germany, but others try to get to Sweden, Britain, the Netherlands and other nations. Previously, the route of choice was across the Mediterranean Sea from Libya. But with that path growing increasingly dangerous, a shorter boat ride from Turkey, to an overland route from Greece to Macedonia to Serbia to southern Hungary started attracting more people this summer. Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, responded by beginning the construction of a razor-wire fence along the country's entire 108-mile border with Serbia. Mr. Orban has also promised a fresh crackdown against those crossing the border when new laws take effect in Hungary on Tuesday, imposing harsh prison penalties for entering the country illegally and allowing the building of ""transit centers"" right at the border where migrants could be held while their cases are being considered. In announcing Germany's new border restrictions, Mr. de Maizière also called for the creation of what he called ""waiting zones"" along the union's external borders where migrants could be registered and wait until they are granted refugee status and assigned to a country. Hungary's government, which has taken a particularly hard line in the crisis, reacted warmly to Germany's announcement on Sunday. ""Hungary understands Germany's decision, and Hungary is standing by Germany,"" Peter Szijjarto, the country's foreign minister, said at a news conference. He said Hungary welcomed Berlin's decision, which he described as defending German and European values, adding that Hungary made a new proposal of its own on Sunday: calling for a Continentwide effort to defend the borders of Greece, the first stop on the migrant path. The migrants who eventually make their way to Hungary usually begin their journey into Europe with a short, but often perilous, sea crossing from Turkey to one of the nearer Greek islands. If European leaders could close off that flow, Hungarian officials said Sunday, the numbers moving through the Balkans into Central Europe would dwindle to a trickle. Advocates for refugees say that those determined to reach Europe will only find other paths. Just how dangerous that sea crossing can be was evident again Sunday when the Greek Coast Guard recovered the bodies of 34 migrants, including 15 children, after their boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. An additional 68 were rescued, and 30 others managed to swim to the nearby island of Farmakonisi. The land portion of the journey offers dangers, too. The Austrian authorities said they had saved 42 people on Sunday from a refrigerated truck near the German border, and arrested two smugglers. Just last month, 71 people were found dead in the back of such a truck near the Austrian-Hungarian border. Germany has said it expects 800,000 migrants by year's end, but has indicated up to now that it can handle the newcomers, and even welcomed their addition to its aging work force. But the numbers arriving have continued to grow, and Germany's humanitarian network is wobbling under the strain. On Saturday, around 12,000 migrants arrived in Munich, with 4,000 more by Sunday afternoon. More beds are needed, Munich officials said. And more migrants are on the way. Before Germany closed off rail traffic from Austria, Austrian officials said 500 migrants were arriving every hour at the main border crossing between Hungary and Austria, with 7,000 crossing that day before 3 p.m. The city of Salzburg sent out a post on Twitter asking residents to bring blankets and camping pads to the railway station to help accommodate several hundred people spending the night there and in a nearby parking garage. On the Serbian border, the Hungarian authorities said that 4,330 migrants were detained Saturday for crossing illegally, an increase of 700 over the previous one-day record. And many thousands more are waiting to cross behind them, or are making their slow way to the border. ""The influx is simply not stopping right now,"" said Lt. Col. Helmut Marban, a police spokesman in Austria's easternmost state. ""We really have our plates full."" Guntram B. Wolff, director of Breugel, a Brussels research group, said Germany's decision to impose controls seemed to be ""an interim thing,"" rather than a sign that the European Union, panicked by a disorderly influx of migrants, was retreating from the principle of open borders. ""It is just a measure to slow down the flow and to handle things in a more orderly manner,"" he said. But if some Europe-wide agreement is not reached to deal with the crisis, Mr. Wolff said, the so-called Schengen system that allows passport-free travel across 26 countries is in danger of collapsing. ""There has to be a European solution, and if there is not one, then Schengen will come under pressure,"" he said. ""For the moment, Schengen is still there."" Abdelkahar Sherzad, a 28-year-old from Afghanistan, heard about Germany's new restrictions only after waiting four days for a train out of Budapest's Keleti station. ""I would really like to go to Germany,"" Mr. Sherzad said. ""But if they don't let me go, I will consider other options, like staying in Austria or trying to go to another country. I won't stop.""

94,1185924139.xml,"       Euro-skepticism has remained a current in British politics, long after Britain put aside centuries of anti-European sentiment to join the Common Market in 1973 and to become a member of the more highly integrated European Union 20 years later.  Until now, periodic spasms of parochialism did little lasting harm. But since the European debt crisis and recession, there has been growing sentiment across the British political spectrum for leaving the European Union. As Roger Carr, the leader of Britain's biggest business group, the Confederation of British Industry, rightly warned on Monday, this latest trend needs to be taken seriously and strongly countered by pro-European business and political leaders. Leading political figures expect a national referendum to be called on continued British membership in the European Union, probably for 2015. If it were held today, an Opinium/Observer poll suggests, the anti-European side would prevail, with a large majority of Conservatives, a plurality of Labour voters and a significant minority of Liberal Democrats voting for a British exit.  Leaving the union would be a grave mistake, sacrificing Britain's best hopes for a brighter economic future to half-baked longing for the simpler days when the British ruled an empire and had less need for European trade. There's plenty of time for pro-Europe leaders to make that case. But they must heed Mr. Carr's advice and speak up. Twenty-seven countries now belong to the European Union, with several more nations like Iceland, Serbia and Turkey hoping to join. Even without further expansion, the union accounts for almost 50 percent of British trade and is its largest trading partner. Of course, the skeptics can point to the European Union's many disappointments. Too much senseless, stifling regulation flows from a bureaucracy with too little democratic accountability. Costly and indefensible agricultural subsidies to local farmers deny needed markets to developing countries and is a factor in driving economic refugees to Europe, a movement that politicians like to rant against.  The euro was established as a common currency with too little preparation and institutional support. And, over the past year, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been destructively pushing her partners to enact laws that would prolong the recession by setting rigid deficit ceilings, denying countries the fiscal flexibility sometimes needed to revive growth.  But the union's shortcomings are all the more reason for Britain to keep its seat at the table where Europe's economic future will be made.  Britain, as the Continent's third-largest economy after Germany and France, has had a crucial role in shaping European policy, pushing the bloc toward freer trade and away from political federalism. And it has helped preserve the rights of others to opt out of unwanted initiatives like the euro. With decisions on fiscal policy, bank supervision and financial regulation likely to be made in the near future, Britain's voice is needed more than ever to protect British interests and larger European ones as well.  British supporters of continued European Union membership in all three major parties and in the business community need to counter the seductive simplicities of the euro-bashers who claim that Britain can ignore Europe and thrive on its own. They need to make the case that British engagement in Europe should be, as Mr. Carr put it Monday, ""the linchpin of our wider global trade ambitions."" Britain needs the European Union as much as it needs Britain.   ",2012-11-23
1813,433308567.xml,"      When Poland was negotiating its entry to the European Union, its diplomats indicated that joining a politically integrated Europe was the best way to protect national interests. This belief in the power of community was shared by the other aspiring countries from the former Soviet bloc, which as a group greatly expanded the union in May 2004. ''Poland was a strong supporter of more integration,'' said Piotr Buras, a European policy specialist at the Willy Brandt Center in Wroclaw, in southern Poland. He said Poles believed that small and medium members would be defended against bigger interests. But President Lech Kaczynski arrived in Berlin on Wednesday bringing a deeply altered vision of Europe: it is a nationalist, Euroskeptic vision, at odds with the policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her government. Mr. Kaczynski has overseen a revision of policy in Warsaw since winning the presidency last October. His conservative government, while supporting European Union enlargement to include Ukraine and Belarus, no longer accepts the idea of a deeper and more integrated Europe. He made the point last month in a state visit to Paris, telling the newspaper Le Figaro bluntly: ''What most interests Poles is what will become of Poland. It's the same in France.'' His brother Jaroslaw, who leads the governing Law and Justice Party, put it even more starkly. ''The defense of our national interests will be on the agenda daily, and our partners should take note of this,'' he said. Those partners have already experienced muscle flexing from Warsaw. Since Lech Kaczynski took office, Poland has tried to block a banking deal, prompting European officials to threaten a lawsuit. Poland also jolted its European neighbors this year when it nearly foiled efforts to keep sales taxes low for certain important services. Aleksander Kwasniewski, his predecessor, supported the European constitution that French and Dutch voters rejected last year. Poland's view on that issue has changed. Ryszard Schnepf, foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, recently told the newspaper Rzeczpospolita that a new European constitution was unnecessary. The Nice Treaty, adopted before enlargement and still in force, would suffice, he said. The treaty gives Poland generous voting rights but is widely viewed as impractical for a bloc that has expanded to 25 members from 15. Mr. Kaczynski is visiting when Mrs. Merkel, also a conservative and newly elected, is seeking ways to revive the constitution and restore Germany's influence in the European Union. Over the past month, Mrs. Merkel and her advisers have started preparations to make such a revival a main topic for Germany when it takes over Europe's rotating presidency next January. The idea is that, with the support of other member states, the new constitution could be made shorter and more focused on principles. But Mrs. Merkel is unlikely to find an ally in Mr. Kaczynski, who appears more determined to defend Poland's sovereignty than to cede powers to Europe. Janusz Onyszkiewicz, leader of Poland's opposition Democratic Party and deputy chairman of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee, says two conflicting attitudes toward the European Union exist in Poland. ''One approach, which supports integration, is to safeguard our interests by being a constructive partner, working in the framework of the E.U. and sacrificing short-term interests for longer terms ones,'' he said. The other view, represented by the new government and president, ''is to fight for our demands and to throw our weight around,'' he said. ''This is not a view that supports further integration, not even a common foreign and security policy.'' Polish analysts say this shift in policy resembles a ''Gaullist'' view of the world in which national interests take precedence over European interests. Mr. Buras, of the Willy Brandt Center, said Mr. Kaczynski was ''very much a Gaullist'' with a conservative view of the world. ''This new government no longer believes that Poland is a small country that needs the support of the'' European Commission ''or that it needs partners to get things done or achieve our goal,'' he said. ''It is a kind of moral superiority influenced by history -- especially the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 against the Nazis and World War II -- which says Poland should be strong and stick to its own vision.''

1515,1878347699.xml,"Will President Trump ever learn -- or care -- that his fact-free tweets have painful consequences, not just at home but abroad? Surely he must sense this by now, as the administration faces the outrage of British allies who have been dragged into his increasingly bogus allegation that he was spied on by the Obama administration.In a feverish defense of Mr. Trump's charge, the White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, on Thursday cited an unsubstantiated Fox News report that the British intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, had been secretly called on by the Obama administration to spy on Mr. Trump.
British officials were terse in their fury, dismissing the allegation as ""nonsense."" ""Utterly ridiculous and should be ignored,"" the British agency said.
White House aides tried to calm the waters with incensed British officials, who said they had received assurances that the allegations would not be repeated. But no one speaks for Mr. Trump. On Friday, he stuck by his wiretapping charge -- without disputing a Fox News commentator's claim of British spy involvement -- despite Republican leaders in Congress debunking his accusation, saying that intelligence investigators have found no evidence to back it.
""Very soon,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview on Wednesday night, the administration ""will be submitting things"" to Congress to prove his outrageous accusation.
What things? From what Alt-Right Tooth Fairy? Surely the nation -- even Mr. Trump's credulous base -- is learning to recognize his dodges when he is cornered. ""I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks,"" Mr. Trump promised, probably quite aware that he can always generate a different controversy by tweet when nothing he says comes true.
Mr. Trump's pattern for abusing the truth was established in his disgraceful five-year-long ""birther"" campaign, in which he promoted the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States. ""I have people that have been studying"" the issue, he said in an interview in 2011. ""They cannot believe what they are finding,"" he said, grabbing national attention with a vile slander against the president.
Mr. Trump backed off that fabrication only when the Republican nomination was safely his. He briefly stipulated the obvious, that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. But he instantly concocted a new falsehood, insisting that his opponent Hillary Clinton, not he, initiated the birther conspiracy.
He never publicly apologized to Mr. Obama for that slur (or to Mrs. Clinton, for that matter). Nor is he likely to apologize to Mr. Obama or Downing Street for the latest. ""If he didn't do it, we shouldn't be reckless in accusations that he did,"" Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said Friday of Mr. Obama, in finding Mr. Trump offered no ""compelling truth.""
The idea of Mr. Trump apologizing for anything is surreal. At a news conference on Friday with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Mr. Trump said he ""very seldom"" regrets his tweets. He tried to argue that the White House was silent about the unsubstantiated story of British espionage, though he did take care to praise the claim as coming from ""a very talented"" commentator. (Meanwhile, of course, he continues to show a mysterious lack of concern for what American intelligence has found to be actual foreign meddling in American politics, by Russia.)
Of course, it was Mr. Spicer, the president's spokesman, who had dutifully come forth, more as minister of propaganda to compound the smear by stretching it all the way to London.
""I don't think we regret anything,"" Mr. Spicer blithely told reporters on Friday, even after Fox News said it ""knows of no evidence"" that the London spying tale is true.

1253,1760702553.xml,"       BERLIN --  The German cabinet endorsed measures on Wednesday that would make it easier to deport many noncitizens convicted of crimes, responding to outrage over the sexual assault of hundreds of women by foreigners on New Year's Eve and growing skepticism about the government's ability to accommodate more than one million asylum seekers. The legislation would lower the bar for denying criminals the right to stay in Germany, allowing the authorities to require anyone to leave the country if convicted of homicide, bodily harm, sexual assault, violent theft or serial shoplifting, even if given only a suspended sentence. The measures require approval in Parliament, but Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition holds a majority there and they are expected to pass easily. Ms. Merkel's refusal to limit the number of migrants entering the country has damaged her popularity and caused a rift in her governing coalition. Other countries in Europe have declined to take in a proportionate share of the migrants who continue to arrive by the thousands, and several have instead responded with measures to restrict migrants. Germany's persistent willingness to accept migrants has meant that ever more are arriving in the country. Public support, however, has shifted from the ecstatic welcome of the summer to increasing unease that only worsened after asylum seekers were linked to sexual assaults on women celebrating the New Year in Cologne. Heiko Maas, the justice minister, said the measures were in the interest of everyone in the country. ""This also helps to protect the hundreds of thousands of refugees who live respectable lives among us,"" Mr. Maas said. ""They do not deserve to be lumped together with criminals."" Under the new law, any criminals with pending applications for asylum in Germany will have their applications withdrawn, and they will be ordered to leave the country. Foreign criminals who have served sentences of at least one year for all crimes will also be deported, in keeping with current laws. Although the changes will make it easier to revoke the right to stay of first-time criminals, many of whom are given only suspended sentences, critics contend that the law does not go far enough because if a criminal comes from a country that is not considered safe, that person cannot be deported, even if ordered to leave Germany. If an individual's home country carries out the death penalty, it can be more difficult to ultimately deport someone.

436,1287291154.xml,"       MARKTL AM INN, Germany -- If we rebuild it, they will come, thought the residents of Marktl am Inn, Pope Benedict XVI's hometown, and for a while they did. But visitors to the museum in the house where he was born, brightly repainted in the white and yellow colors of the Vatican, had begun to taper off well before his abrupt resignation this week. When Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became pontiff nearly eight years ago, there were high hopes that his elevation would put this tiny Bavarian village on the map. Mayor Hubert Gschwendtner set up a tourism board, sponsored by the regional authorities, the local bank and the village of Marktl. He established an information office in the foyer of City Hall and published pamphlets in German, English, Italian and Polish. In the first few years, about 200,000 came annually to see Benedict's birthplace. Lately, the number has fallen to half that, and with the pope stepping down, it is likely to fall further. ""For Marktl it is a bit sad,"" Mr. Gschwendtner said of the pope's decision to step down. Marktl's letdown reflects in many ways Germany's experience with its first pope in half a millennium: enthusiasm followed by a reality check. Benedict was not the same sort of charismatic rock-star pope as his friend and predecessor, John Paul II. More important, perhaps, Germany is not Poland, John Paul's more Roman Catholic homeland. It was something of an odd match right from the start, the dedicated, conservative theologian and his largely secular, socially liberal home country. Germans treated his ""victory"" as pope almost like winning an Olympic gold medal or the Eurovision song contest.  The reality was a little different. Just one year after he became pope, Benedict angered Muslims with a speech in his longtime home, Regensburg, in which he quoted a reference to Islam as ""evil and inhuman."" Serious allegations that there had been child sexual abuse by priests in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising when he was archbishop there surfaced during his tenure as pope. And even Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized him after he revoked the excommunications of four schismatic ultraconservative bishops, including one, Richard Williamson, who denied the Holocaust. ""We are not pope,"" many Germans said in Twitter posts in the hours after his announcement, some in jest and some with an apparent twinge of sadness, a reference to the now-famous headline in the tabloid Bild, ""We Are Pope,"" that captured the German enthusiasm at Benedict's election in 2005. More than a few joked that the pope had actually stepped down because he had passed off Bible passages as his own one time too many -- a reference to the plagiarism scandal that has claimed two members of Ms. Merkel's cabinet, most recently on Saturday, when the education minister stepped down. Detlef Schuricht, a native of Berlin, and his wife drove 30 minutes through the snow-covered hills of Bavaria from a nearby vacation resort to Marktl on Tuesday. Neither of them is Catholic, but they figured that since they were nearby, it would be an appropriate way to honor the first German to lead the Catholic Church in centuries. But they found the museum closed, as it is from Nov. 1 to Easter Monday every year. That was better than the butcher shop, where a sign taped to the door reads, ""Closed since Dec. 2, 1997,"" the day the butcher who ran it died. Across the street, large flakes of pale green paint peel off the front of the Gasthof Strasser hotel, and the windows are caked in dust.  ""Even the bakery that sells Vatican bread on Mondays and Fridays didn't bother to open today,"" said Mr. Schuricht, shaking his head.  The optimism here was once far greater. In addition to establishing the museum and the information center, village officials worked with regional authorities to develop a bicycle route through the stations of the pope's early life in the region. Visitors came from Poland, especially Wadowice, birthplace of John Paul II, which became a partner village. But Marktl's claim to fame was never quite the bonanza that some envisioned. Most pilgrims who make the trip to this village between the Inn River and the Austrian border arrive by bus, said Roland Stadler, the deputy mayor. After touring the house where the future pope was born and the baptismal font where he was christened, and then perhaps having a quick coffee, they continue on their way.  ""It allowed us to improve our infrastructure in ways that previously would have been unthinkable,"" Mr. Stadler said. ""But it was never a big economic boon."" Officials pushed back against a rush of merchandising from companies outside the village that sought to cash in on the link to the pontiff with cheap trinkets. Agriculture and a nearby factory, not tourism, remain the main sources of income in the region.  Still, for the people of Marktl, Benedict remains an inspiration. Jutta Heimerl-Sejpka's eyes light up as she recalls the visits he made to the village as Cardinal Ratzinger in the years before he became pope.  ""He is one of us,"" said Mrs. Heimerl-Sejpka, recounting how he broke protocol during a visit in 2006, stepping into the crowd to bless the villagers who had packed the square to see him in person. ""He always made it clear how important we are to him.""  Mr. Gschwendtner, Marktl's mayor since 1996, had the inspired idea to award Cardinal Ratzinger an honor equivalent to the keys to Marktl in 1997, linking him to the village where he was baptized and spent the first two years of his life, before his family moved on.  Despite the loss for the village, Mr. Gschwendtner said there was much sympathy for Benedict's decision. ""We understand that at nearly 86, he could no longer endure the enormous pressure,"" he said. Although Benedict plans to formally step down on Feb. 28, the village nevertheless will go ahead with a planned weeklong festival around the pope's birthday in April that has been held annually since 2005, Mr. Gschwendtner said. ""At the end of the day, there aren't so many places in Germany that can claim to be the birthplace of a pope,"" he said.

1072,2000971037.xml,"LONDON -- During an interview in late 2016 about the rise of populism, Yascha Mounk, a lecturer at Harvard University who is the author of the new book ""The People vs. Democracy,"" made an offhand comment that now seems grimly prophetic.In recent years, he said, Europe's center-left and center-right parties had tended to work together, either unofficially or in a grand coalition, in what was viewed as high-minded and sensible, an important bulwark against the rise of the far right.But Mr. Mounk believed such cooperation ultimately led to instability. Those ""ideologically weird"" coalitions tend to alienate voters, he said, by implying that there was little real difference between establishment right and left.And grand-coalition politics, he said, also meant that ""the things that the populists have said all along -- that everything else in politics is the same and a conspiracy against them, and the only way to change the government is to vote for the populists -- become true.""Mr. Mounk worried that this might not only fuel the rise of the far right but could also undermine the stability of European democracy itself.At the time, his concerns seemed overblown. But Mr. Mounk's words came readily to mind this past week as the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, announced that her center-right Christian Democrats had entered into yet another grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats.Though it was nominally a victory for centrist stability, one look at the grim expressions of Ms. Merkel and her new cabinet members revealed the truth: Few believe this type of politics is sustainable any more.A political era is ending in Europe. What comes next may not be the populist takeover some feared. Rather, it will be a subtler, if no less consequential, form of political hollowing out, with serious consequences for democracy.In the 2017 election in Germany that set off coalition negotiations, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats suffered their worst losses ever in the postwar era, losing more than 100 seats in the Bundestag, the German federal legislature. This has been the story across Europe, as establishment parties plummet in popularity.Most analysts attributed the German mainstream parties' losses to voters' anger at the years of grand-coalition government, which many said had rendered the parties distant and indistinguishable. And so this new coalition, offering more of the same, seems like a rejection of the public will.It is just the latest sign that Europe may be entering an ominous new political phase. Agreements between the center-left and center-right have long been seen as a fundamental building block of European stability. But now, as such agreements falter, the popularity of mainstream parties is falling fast, with the center-left's support collapsing particularly quickly.In the Netherlands, the far-right Freedom Party's 2017 election gains grabbed headlines, but mainstream party losses were even bigger. The Dutch Labour Party, which had been the junior partner in a coalition government before the election, was nearly wiped out, losing 29 of its 38 seats. Its erstwhile coalition partner, the center-right People's Party, lost eight seats.In France, none of the traditional political parties made it past the first round of the presidential election. In legislative elections that followed a few months later, results for the mainstream parties were even worse. The Socialists, long the largest party of the French center-left, won only 30 seats as President Emmanuel Macron's brand-new party, En Marche, swept to victory.Piero Ignazi, a professor of political science at the University of Bologna in Italy, says he believes that as centrist parties have collaborated more closely, voters have come to see them as representing their own elite interests, not those of ordinary citizens.'A sort of vengeance'""People don't feel represented any longer by the parties,"" Mr. Ignazi said. ""And that sentiment is particularly strong among working-class and low-income people.""The result, he says, is the rise of what he calls ""anti-party sentiment,"" which has fueled the extremist parties. ""A vote for the far right is a sort of vengeance for being betrayed,"" he said.As voters turn toward anti-establishment parties, polarizing away from the center, that makes it more difficult for parties to cooperate and govern, weakening the system further. And as politics, and perhaps European societies themselves, become more polarized, that will make it even more difficult for political systems to address major challenges, such as European Union-wide financial strain or the immigration crisis.Those issues require politicians to balance national or Europe-wide interests against partisan pressures.Political parties are fundamental institutions of democracy. And as mainstream parties decline, and politics fractures among newer and smaller parties, those institutions become weaker. If Europe's most important parties crumble or become unstable, to be replaced by new parties that lack institutional memory and resources, that leaves the system as a whole less stable, regardless of what kind of politics its leaders embrace.And even parties that have managed to remain popular with voters are still at risk of being divided or hollowed out by anti-establishment sentiment.In the United Kingdom, the Conservative party leadership agreed to the 2016 Brexit referendum in order to stave off defections from the right wing of its base. The results were catastrophically destabilizing. The Labour Party, unlike most of its center-left brethren across Europe, managed to gain in voting share in the most recent election.But its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has himself embraced anti-system politics in many ways, and his allies have clashed with the party mainstream from within.Losing the gatekeepers of democracyThe ""essential test"" for democratic resilience, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, both political scientists at Harvard, write in their new book ""How Democracies Die,"" is whether political leaders, and especially political parties, will work together to prevent extremists from gaining power.""Political parties are democracy's gatekeepers,"" they write. ""Although mass responses to extremist appeals matter, what matters more is whether political elites, and especially parties, serve as filters.""And so to protect democracy, parties and other political elites need to keep would-be authoritarians off ballots at election time, root out extremists within their own party's ranks, refuse alliances with anti-democratic candidates or parties and work to isolate extremists rather than legitimizing them.When that does not happen, they warn, countries risk following in the footsteps of Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and other nations where elected leaders have chipped away at democracy from within.But that kind of gatekeeping requires that parties have the strength to enforce discipline within their own ranks and the popularity to maintain voter good will. And as Europe's mainstream parties crumble, their gatekeeping capacity has, too.Worrying about the stability of some of the world's oldest and wealthiest democracies can seem like paranoia. But in an article in Foreign Affairs, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Erica Frantz, a professor at Michigan State University, warn that citizens in Europe ""should hesitate before assuming that they are invulnerable to a populist-driven backslide.""Europe, they write, is experiencing many of the factors that have led other established democracies to erode: rising populism, social polarization, weakening institutions, economic insecurity and public distrust of government. That does not mean Western Europe will turn into Venezuela, but its cherished democracies could grow less effective and more prone to extremism and demagoguery.The incremental steps of democratic backsliding, they wrote, can mean that ""there is no single moment that triggers widespread resistance or creates a focal point around which an opposition can coalesce.""But, they warn, ""if left untamed, they will lead to grave consequences for global democracy.""Germany's new coalition: Left, Horst Seehofer, leader of the conservative Christian Social Union; Chancellor Angela Merkel; and Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats.

1569,1783732310.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDED. LONDON -- President Obama will meet with Western European leaders on Sunday and Monday amid a growing sense in his administration that Europe is faltering in the face of multiple challenges, undercutting the trans-Atlantic alliance at a critical time. Even as Mr. Obama has tried to focus United States foreign policy more on Asia and China's rising power, administration aides say they have watched with concern as European unity has come under increased strain at a time of increased Russian aggression, slow economic growth, a virulent terrorism threat, and a huge influx of migrants from the Middle East and beyond. In meeting in Germany on Sunday with Chancellor Angela Merkel and on Monday with Ms. Merkel, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, President François Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, Mr. Obama intends to press his European counterparts on a number of issues, aides said. They include a new trans-Atlantic trade pact, the need for better intelligence sharing within Europe about the terrorism threat, holding firm against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and trying to find a solution to the civil war in Syria. He is scheduled to give a speech Monday in Germany taking stock of Europe's challenges. ""This speech allows him to step back at a time when the United States and Europe, together, are dealing with a range of challenges, from counter-ISIL and the threat of terrorism, to the current refugee crisis,"" said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser. Mr. Rhodes said part of the president's address would focus on trade, including efforts by Europe and the United States ""to combat the headwinds in the global economy and promote sustainable growth."" In an interview published in a German newspaper on the eve of his visit there, Mr. Obama said it was ""not my place to tell Europe how to manage Europe."" But he said it benefited the United States to have a ""strong, united, democratic Europe."" And he said the ""serious challenges"" facing Europe must be confronted boldly. ""The terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels were not only strikes on two of the world's great cities, they were assaults on the values of openness and diversity that we cherish on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Mr. Obama said in the German paper, Bild Zeitung. ""We've learned through painful experience that threats to Europe ultimately become threats to the United States."" His message was similar in tone to the one he delivered Friday in London, where he bluntly urged British voters to reject a proposal to leave the European Union. He said that Britain was stronger inside the bloc and that a united Europe was in the interests of the United States. European unity ""is under strain,"" Mr. Obama said Friday as he stood by Mr. Cameron at a news conference and offered full-throated support for the prime minister's campaign to keep Britain in the European Union. At the same news conference, Mr. Obama asserted that ""the ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart."" But administration aides say they share the fears among European officials in Brussels that a British vote to quit the European Union could pull a vital brick out of an already shaky structure. ""We've seen some divisions and difficulties between the southern and the northern parts of Europe,"" Mr. Obama said Friday, referring to the euro crisis and migration. ""That's created some strains."" But there are further tensions between Eastern and Western members of the European Union and NATO, too, over how to manage a more assertive, revanchist Russia, which has torn up the post-Cold War order in Ukraine and is trying to undermine confidence in NATO's principle of collective defense. The economy of the European Union has been much slower to recover from the crash in 2008, making the challenge of mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa harder to handle. The confusion and popular fear that matters are not under control have undermined public confidence in Ms. Merkel and in other European leaders, while promoting populism, Islamophobia and ultranationalism among a growing minority of voters. Those same forces have also helped to stall negotiations toward a far-reaching trade deal between the United States and the European Union. Opponents, particularly in Germany, argue that the agreement would inevitably favor the interests of large corporations and cause a shift of jobs to outsiders. Thousands of people protesting the trade deal are expected in Hanover, Germany, on Sunday when Mr. Obama arrives to tour an industrial trade show with Ms. Merkel. Mr. Obama, whose vision of a stronger, more cohesive Europe includes passage of the trade deal, campaigned Saturday on its behalf in London, where he urged a roomful of young people to view it as a positive approach. ""Part of the argument I'm making in the United States is that the answer to globalization and income inequality and lack of wage growth is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off trade,"" Mr. Obama said. Among the main concerns of Mr. Obama's delegation is major, consistent gaps in intelligence gathering and intelligence sharing within Europe when the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is targeting the Continent and exploiting the ease of movement across borders. That vulnerability prompted Mr. Obama to call together the meeting on Monday with his counterparts from the four biggest Western European nations, to discuss counterterrorism strategies and intelligence sharing. ""They understand how indispensable U.S. intelligence is for understanding who is in the country, where they are moving around,"" said Heather Conley, a former State Department official and now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""This is completely weighing down Europe."" The five leaders are also likely to discuss the situations in Syria and in Libya, where the Islamic State has built a strong presence close to Europe in the chaos that resulted from the Western intervention to overthrow Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The president will be back in Europe for a NATO summit meeting in early July, when many of these same issues will be on the table, including a pronounced political shift to the right in the host country, Poland. Mr. Obama has already agreed to increase the number of American troops in Europe, announcing in March that he would deploy rotations of United States-based armored brigade combat teams to Eastern Europe to create what officials call a continuous, but not a ""permanent,"" presence. But there are also concerns about an increasingly authoritarian presidential regime in Turkey, a NATO member that is a front-line state with Syria. Turkey is also playing an important if controversial role in preventing migrants and asylum seekers from trying to reach Europe by boat. In the interview in the German paper, Mr. Obama praised Ms. Merkel as being ""courageous"" in handling of the surge of migrants into Europe from Syria. The president said Ms. Merkel had ""spoken of our moral obligation to people, including families and children, fleeing horrific conditions, including the barbarity of the Assad regime in Syria and ISIL."" The president also used the trip to buck up Mr. Cameron, with whom he played golf on Saturday at the Grove, the site of the 2016 British Masters tournament and one of England's most luxurious courses. But the president's intervention in the British debate over the European Union has been controversial, with a significant number of commentators saying he was overstepping. Robin Niblett, however, the director of Chatham House, a policy institute in London, said the United States was right to try to intervene after having fought two wars in the last century to keep Europe free. A British exit, Mr. Niblett said, ""would potentially destabilize the E.U. at just the wrong time: when a rearmed Russia has rejected the rules-based order created to sustain peace in Europe after the Cold War, when Continental E.U. governments are struggling to manage an unprecedented inflow of refugees and migrants, and when populist parties are gaining in strength on the back of a still painful economic recession for many."" ""And,"" he continued, ""it would leave just as the U.S. is trying to strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship in the face of a more economically and politically assertive China.""

2366,1693311419.xml,"       BERLIN --  In the summer of 2011, American intelligence agencies spied on a senior German official who they concluded had been the likely source of classified information being leaked to the news media. The Obama administration authorized the top American spy in Germany to reveal to the German government the identity of the official, according to German officials and news media reports. The decision was made despite the risk of exposing that the United States was monitoring senior national security aides to Chancellor Angela Merkel. The tip-off appears to have led to a senior German intelligence official being barred from access to sensitive material. But it also raises suspicions that Ms. Merkel's government had strong indications of the extent of American surveillance at least two years before the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, which included the number of a cellphone used by the chancellor. The decision by the United States to risk disclosing a surveillance operation against a close ally indicates the high level of concern over the perceived security breach. It is unclear, however, what that information might have been or if it involved intelligence provided to Germany by the United States. The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported Friday that it believed the American effort to expose the German intelligence official arose from conversations by its own journalists. It filed a complaint with the federal prosecutor in Germany over espionage activity and a violation of Germany's data protection laws. The prosecutor's office declined to comment, other than to confirm that the filing had been received. In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council, Ned Price, declined on Friday to comment on the reported surveillance other than to indicate that the government does not spy on foreign journalists. ""The United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security,"" Mr. Price said. The disclosure is the latest intelligence revelation to shake the alliance, even though it is unclear that the National Security Agency actively listened to Ms. Merkel's calls. Among other actions that widened the rift, the Germans last summer expelled the then-C.I.A. chief. And this week material uncovered by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks suggested that the Americans had been spying on their German allies back to the 1990s. The first hints emerged in the German media this year. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that Hans Josef Vorbeck, a deputy director of the chancellery's intelligence division, had been ""put out in the cold"" in 2011 after the then-C.I.A. station chief in Berlin gave information to Mr. Vorbeck's boss, Günter Heiss. Der Spiegel said Mr. Heiss was specifically told of contacts with its journalists. Mr. Heiss, a quiet but powerful figure in German intelligence activities, was questioned for nearly six hours at an open hearing of a German parliamentary committee on Thursday. Mr. Heiss was particularly reticent when asked about Mr. Vorbeck. He repeatedly declined to answer questions about him, challenging the mandate of the committee to pose such queries, and arguing that he was not allowed to discuss a third party in public. Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker for the opposition Green Party, which has been vocal in its criticism of Ms. Merkel and the German handling of alleged American espionage, accused Mr. Heiss of hiding behind a ""cascade"" of excuses. Eventually, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a longtime lawmaker for the Greens, asked Mr. Heiss whether he ever had a ""concrete suspicion"" that Mr. Vorbeck was leaking classified information. Mr. Heiss said there was no ""concrete suspicion"" that would have led to ""concrete action."" He indicated the matter had been discussed in the chancellery, but declined to give specifics. But when asked whether Mr. Vorbeck had been the target of spying, Mr. Heiss declared: ""No. That much I can say."" In a report in the edition it published on Saturday, Der Spiegel said Mr. Heiss had learned of the suspicions against Mr. Vorbeck in the summer of 2011, when invited by the C.I.A. station chief to take a walk. Appearing before the committee last month, Guido Müller, a senior intelligence official, at first said he could not recall Mr. Vorbeck's transfer to a lower-level job. Mr. Müller then said he could remember it only if testifying behind closed doors. When he appeared before the committee, two days shy of his 64th birthday, Mr. Vorbeck himself was cagey. When Mr. von Notz raised the Bild am Sonntag reports and asked for more detail, the demoted intelligence officer replied that he ""did not know much more than what has been in the papers,"" according to a transcript on a live-blog at netzpolitik.org, a website that tracks intelligence matters. André Hahn, a lawmaker for the opposition Left party, asked Mr. Vorbeck whether he had a good relationship with Mr. Heiss -- ""at first,"" Mr. Vorbeck answered -- and whether he had ever been charged with betraying secrets. ""Not then and not now,"" Mr. Vorbeck replied, according to the netzpolitik blog. Mr. Vorbeck is suing the government for material damages he said he suffered as a result of being transferred to a senior archival post concerning the history of German intelligence. His lawyer declined to return a call seeking comment or access to his client. The dimensions of German anger over American espionage have been evidenced in public opinion polls and in protests against a possible trans-Atlantic trade pact. German officials have talked about creating an internal Internet so that communications among Germans do not have to pass outside the country. What makes these disclosures different is that they suggest that German publications have been either direct or indirect targets of American surveillance. ""Spiegel suspects spying by U.S. secret services,"" the online edition of the respected weekly Die Zeit reported Friday.  The latest disclosures by WikiLeaks -- a summary of an October 2011 conversation Ms. Merkel had with an adviser about the debt crisis in Greece, a document from her senior adviser on European affairs, plus a list of 69 telephone numbers of important ministries and senior officials that appeared to date back to the 1990s -- had already prompted Ms. Merkel's chief of staff on Thursday to invite the United States ambassador, John B. Emerson, to explain. A government statement following that meeting did not confirm the material, but made plain that violations of German laws would be prosecuted. The government defended its heightened counterintelligence operations, hinting at the depth of anger with the United States. Steffen Seibert, the German government spokesman, referred inquiries on Friday to another government spokesman who said he could not be identified by name. He reiterated that the government did not comment on personnel moves, and that it reported on intelligence services only to the relevant supervisory committee in Parliament. The spokesman added in an email that Mr. Heiss had testified on Thursday that there was no reason to take disciplinary or other action regarding Mr. Vorbeck.

1062,846813062.xml,"      Santa Monica. Calif.   FEO ALADAG, whose debut film ""When We Leave"" is a family drama about an honor killing within the Turkish population of Berlin, is a blond  Austrian who lives in Berlin with her husband, Zuli Aladag, a Turkish-born German filmmaker. The film, made by the couple's production company, is Germany's entry for an Academy Award in the foreign film category. The personal and creative partnership of the Aladags might be a blueprint for happy integration in a country known for a  volatile relationship with its large Turkish minority, many of whose members are full citizens who have lived and worked in Germany for several generations.    Yet ""When We Leave,""  which Ms. Aladag (pronounced FEE-oh al-a-DAG), 39, wrote and directed,  is a tragedy about a Turkish family sagging beneath the weight of intergenerational conflicts that touch on a hot-button issue in European countries with significant Muslim populations: the powerlessness of women with male family members who consider violence a form of domestic discipline.    In the movie, which opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles, Sibel Kekilli -- an expressive young actress whose haunting Modigliani face may be familiar from Fatih Akin's kinetic 2005 film ""Head-On,"" which also deals with honor killings -- plays Umay, a German-born mother of a young boy who flees her abusive husband in Turkey. Seeking shelter with her family in Berlin, Umay discovers that her freedom comes at a terrible cost.   The project, Ms. Aladag explained recently during a break at a brunch for filmmakers in the New German Cinema festival here, grew out of two short films she made for an Amnesty International campaign to end violence against women. Spurred on by a spate of honor killings -- punitive murders within families for perceived sexual transgressions -- in Germany, Ms. Aladag, a former actress with a doctorate in psychology, researched the subject for three years before she began shooting ""When We Leave."" The film's honor killings occur among Muslims, but Ms. Aladag is quick to point out that the practice is nowhere prescribed in the Koran or any other bible. Its origins go ""back much farther than the big monotheist religions,"" she said, adding that they are tribal and patriarchal and designed to control female sexuality and reproduction.    ""When We Leave"" has the intensity of a noirish maternal melodrama and the domestic specificity of a movie made by a woman. In fact it was made by several: Ms. Aladag's cinematographer, editor, production designer and co-producer are all women. Ms. Aladag's mother, a Viennese painter, instilled in her daughter an awareness of women's issues. ""I was raised on Alice Miller and Freud and Breuer,"" she said. The conflict between Umay's love for her traditional family and her need to run her own modern life drives ""When We Leave."" Yet the film is notable for its empathetic attention to the multiple points of view that separate Umay from her loving but conservative parents; a younger sister who takes what Ms. Aladag calls ""the easy path""; her sweetly bewildered younger brother; and a furiously reactionary older brother whom Ms. Aladag describes, with evident sympathy, as ""a lost soul.""   Kirsten Niehuus, of Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, the German-government film fund that partly financed the movie, said in an e-mail message that ""even though there is no doubt that honor killings cannot be tolerated at all, we understand that the murderers themselves are victims of a tradition that is bound to end, rather than monsters.""    It's likely that the film's inclusivity accounts for its ubiquity on the international film festival circuit. ""Five continents, 20 countries and 54 festivals so far,"" Ms. Aladag said with a touch of weariness. She was poised and elegant but confessed that she had ""my terrors at night,"" wondering if the film's subject matter would put her in danger. Aside from the occasional verbal attack, the film has played without incident in countries like Morocco, where it screened recently to a warm reception at the Marrakech Film Festival.   If ""When We Leave"" was going to ruffle feathers anywhere, perhaps it would be in Germany, where honor killings often provoke attacks on Islam and Muslims in the news media. But it won seven nominations from the German critics' association. ""I don't remember much discussion of honor killings related specifically to the film,"" said David Hudson, an aggregator of global film commentary for the Berlin Web site Mubi.com, in an e-mail message. ""Instead these discussions arise periodically in the wake of actual honor killings, a few per year of which become headline-making stories.""     Umay's brief encounters with non-Turkish Germans in ""When We Leave"" are benign -- in marked contrast to her growing vulnerability at home, the police, her non-Turkish best friend and a potential lover all offer comfort and shelter. When asked how this squares with persistent hostility among some Germans toward immigrants from Islamic countries, and with Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent claim that multiculturalism had failed, Ms. Aladag weighed her words carefully. ""I don't think it's a constructive way to tackle the debate, though everything there needs to be discussed and ventilated. It's just, how do you lead a discussion like this, what's the spirit behind it?""    ""We have had a hard time recognizing that we are a society of migrants,"" she added. ""We have to live with the diversity that's already there. I would consider this family German as well. If the majority doesn't give the minority the feeling of being accepted and welcomed, how can you overcome old structures, if you draw your self-esteem and identity from a smaller community that isolates you, if you define your honor as a man by the sexual innocence of your wives and daughters?""   In the movie Umay is a whirl of perpetual motion who can neither stay with her family nor make a clean break with it. ""You need to give the audience a feeling of the possibilities for reconciliation, a moment when people are able to step over their shadows, overcome their principles and reach out to find common ground,"" Ms. Aladag insisted. ""If we don't do it there's going to be, socially and politically, a catastrophe.""    ""When We Leave"" ends with private catastrophe -- and, perhaps, a glimmer of romantic hope for an ethnically blended future.    ""Love is strong,""  Ms. Aladag said with a smile. ""Maybe we should talk to Mrs. Merkel about this.""

1151,858405198.xml,"      WASHINGTON -- Russia, responding to the Japanese nuclear crisis, will perform a ""stress test"" on all its reactors to judge their ability to withstand earthquakes more powerful than the original design anticipated, the Russian state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom said on Thursday.    Rosatom is willing to share the test results with the United States, said the company's director general, Sergey Kirienko, who met here with Energy Department officials.   The United States and Russia signed a nuclear cooperation agreement last year.    Mr. Kirienko also said he thought the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an industry group based in London, should have expanded authority to inspect reactors and coordinate safety efforts. Rosatom is a member of the group.    In an interview, Mr. Kirienko said the Russian stress tests would be completed in the next few months.    The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is pushing for the European Union to conduct such tests on all 143 nuclear reactors of its member countries. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Wednesday that it would complete a review of American reactors over the next 90 days, to determine what changes might be necessary after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan.   If Russian reactors failed the stress tests, ""we will have to take compensating measures,"" Mr. Kirienko said.    ""I do not exclude the possibility of decommissioning some reactors, or replacing them with new ones as soon as possible.""   American reactors were put through a similar exercise in the 1990s, identifying weak spots and reinforcing them. At some plants, workers attached extra cables to the ceiling tiles in control rooms, to make sure they would not fall on operators in an earthquake. At others they beefed up the overhead trays that support control cables and power cables. Some strengthened the big tanks that hold cooling water; sometimes that meant removing small glass windows in the tank wall used to observe the water level, because the window could break, creating a leak.    Russia does not operate any boiling water reactors, the type involved in Fukushima. It operates many pressurized water reactors, a design also used in the West that Russian officials say is inherently safer. Some of the oldest such reactors in Russia have an extra-large volume of cooling water on hand, Mr. Kirienko said.    Mr. Kirienko said he did not expect the Fukushima case to affect the pace of reactor construction in China or India, because those countries already had nuclear expertise. But he said that reactor development in Italy, Switzerland and Venezuela, which do not have reactors now, would be delayed. And he said that Germany, which decided last week to shut down seven older nuclear plants, would probably also slow any new developments.    Despite the crisis in Japan, Russia may actually increase nuclear construction, Rosatom officials said. Sergey Novikov, a spokesman, said that before the disaster, the Russian goal was to increase the fraction of electricity from reactors to 25 to 30 percent by 2030, from 16 percent now.   In light of Fukushima, he said, the effort might turn to replacing some older reactors.       ",2011-03-25
1389,2040528100.xml,"PARIS -- President Emmanuel Macron's warm embrace of the American president, replete with hand-holding, hugs and dandruff dusting, has come back to haunt the young French leader and open him to searing criticism from political opponents at home.The lavish show of friendship with an American president who is deeply unpopular in France has cost Mr. Macron, whose support was already wobbling over perceptions that his policies have favored the rich. Mr. Macron's unrequited pleas for policy shifts from Mr. Trump are perceived as failures, and more than half of those surveyed in a poll last weekend disapproved of his gushy performance, for which he got nothing in return.The price to Mr. Macron's standing has now been compounded by Mr. Trump's decision last week to withdraw from the Iran accord, after Mr. Macron went to Washington last month, in part to try to persuade the American president to preserve it.France ""prostituted itself"" and ""humiliated itself in its relations with the U.S.,"" Daniel Fasquelle, a member of Parliament from a center-right party in the opposition, told reporters in the halls of the Assemblée Nationale last week in the wake of Mr. Trump's decision on Iran.Another lawmaker, Clémentine Autain, on the left, told the journalists, ""France favors a partner which happens to be a dangerous partner for world peace.""""France should bang its fist on the table,"" she said, ""rather than go courting Donald Trump.""Mr. Macron's enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump is being contrasted unfavorably with the far cooler approach of other European leaders, like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and his predecessors in the French presidency, who kept the Americans at arm's length.In addition to striking out on the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Macron previously got nothing from Mr. Trump on climate change, and he has yet to win permanent exemptions on steel tariffs. As far as many French are concerned, he is zero for three.""Macron's alignment with Trump is a catastrophe,"" said Patrick Cassan, a civil servant interviewed in the mixed-income 19th Arrondissement of Paris. Mr. Macron was ""not only incapable of saying no"" to Mr. Trump, he ""served as his dishrag,"" he said.Others were equally disapproving of all the hugging and backslapping. ""These gestures were like signs of vassalage,"" with Mr. Macron playing the part of the serf, said J. C. Icart, a retired writer for scientific journals, interviewed outside the arrondissement's City Hall. ""In the feudal system, you showed your allegiance by this kind of touching.""Mr. Macron's attitude toward Mr. Trump was rejected by 55 percent of respondents in a poll conducted by Odoxa for Le Figaro, one of France's two leading daily newspapers. The American president's decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran was disapproved by three-quarters of those polled.""The president is perceived as having failed in his strategy in regard to Donald Trump,"" the polling company said.Some were more forgiving of Mr. Macron, but not entirely. ""He fought hard for the Iran accord. You can't criticize him for that,"" said Nicole Bacharan, an analyst of American-French relations formerly at the Hudson Institute. ""He tried.""""On the other hand, many people in France were uneasy with these physical gestures,"" she added. ""The hugs seemed a bit immoderate, given the situation.""True, Mr. Macron's speech to  Congress was an oblique critique of Mr. Trump.""I do not share the fascination for new strong powers, the abandonment of freedom and the illusion of nationalism,"" he said in a veiled slap at his host.But the recent poll suggests that the images from the days preceding the speech drowned out Mr. Macron's words.Odoxa, the polling firm, found that the words ""sycophantic,"" ""painful"" and ""failure"" were among the most frequently used on social media to describe the Macron-Trump relationship.Shortly after Mr. Macron returned to France, Mr. Trump only rubbed salt in the wounds, telling a National Rifle Association convention that an armed bystander could have stopped the terrorist massacre at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in 2015.Mr. Trump's remark drew cross-party scorn in France, and a sharp rebuke from the French Foreign Ministry. One Bataclan survivor invited Mr. Trump, on Twitter, to stick a handgun somewhere unprintable.Meanwhile, Mr. Macron himself has shown signs of trying to create some distance after the fruitless trip to Washington.""We've made the choice to build peace and stability in the Near and Middle East,"" Mr. Macron said in a speech last week from Aachen, Germany, after accepting an award for his efforts in Europe. ""Other world powers,"" he added, not mentioning Mr. Trump by name, ""just as sovereign as ourselves, have decided not to respect their own word.""Afterward, he tried to explain his failure to university students in the German city.""I've known him for a year. I have a lot of respect for him,"" Mr. Macron said. ""People know we have a warm relationship. But a warm relationship is not the relationship of a magician.""To be sure, French officials were under few illusions before Mr. Macron's trip to Washington that he could persuade Mr. Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. But since the announcement of the withdrawal, they have expressed anger over American threats of sanctions against European companies, and the menace to France's sovereignty.A spokesman for Mr. Macron's political movement in Parliament defended the French president's tactile approach to Mr. Trump. The French president, he said, would never have gotten anywhere deploying the kind of strategy -- reason and logic -- that might have worked with President Obama.""He used an emotional strategy"" said Hervé Berville, who represents a district in Brittany. ""With irrationality, you can deploy physical contact, touching.""Others in Parliament, even some who have been critical of Mr. Macron in other domains, were inclined to give him a pass, too, given the difficulty of the target.""I wonder about the ability of this head of state, or of any other, to have influence over Mr. Trump,"" said Jean-Michel Clément, a member of Parliament who recently left the president's political movement, La République en Marche, over its immigration stance.""You can't reproach the president of the republic for having put his best foot forward on these sensitive issues,"" he added.Mr. Macron, judging by his speech in Aachen last week, himself appears to have drawn one principal lesson from his encounter with the American president: the need for more muscular European unity.""If we accept that other great powers, including allies, including friends who have been with us in the darkest hours, put themselves in the position of deciding for us our diplomacy, our security, while putting us at severe risk,"" he said, ""then we are no longer sovereign, and we can't credibly face public opinion.""Credit: ADAM NOSSITER; Alissa Rubin contributed reporting.President Trump at the White House last month with President Emmanuel Macron of France.

750,1719345867.xml,"       STUTTGART, Germany --  With arson attacks on refugee camps and resistance from Chancellor Angela Merkel's own political partners, it's not hard to find doomsayers predicting trouble for German cities absorbing asylum seekers. But in this peaceful and pragmatic city, synonymous with German know-how and corporate giants like Bosch, Porsche and Mercedes, it is possible to glimpse something else: a rosier future. Here, migration has long been an engine of growth, and integration the bedrock of civic pride. The problems Stuttgart faces are ones that prosperous cities around the globe now share, American ones included: a dearth of affordable housing and the kind of apartments that suit the evolving demographics of the people who occupy them. The message from Stuttgart is that migrants are needed, even welcome. The challenge is building a city they can live in. ""Boomtowns are integration cities,"" said Gari Pavkovic, the son of a Croatian guest worker who arrived here decades ago. Mr. Pavkovic now manages immigration for the city government. He ticked off numbers. Forty percent of Stuttgart's 600,000 residents (or 60 percent of people under the age of 18) come from abroad, twice the national average. After World War II, foreign laborers rebuilt local industry: first Italians, then Greeks, Spaniards, Yugoslavians, Turks. And they're still coming. Some 20,000 newcomers arrive annually, not counting the current wave of Syrians and others. Immigrants account for one of every three start-ups. The other day, Levent Gunes, who works for the city planning office, provided a tour of a disused tank engine factory, an industrial relic being converted into an arts complex. The man who bought it was born in Turkey and owns a bakery across the street, Mr. Gunes said, next to a big Turkish supermarket and mosque. ""The percentage of entrepreneurs in Stuttgart with migrant backgrounds is the highest in Germany,"" Mr. Gunes, who teaches at Stuttgart University and is the son of Turkish migrants himself, elaborated over börek and yogurt at the bakery. ""We're talking I.T. people, engineers, architects, artists,"" he said. ""You only see the greengrocer and the butcher at street level, not all the doctors and lawyers upstairs."" Stuttgart's big move was to avoid pushing migrants into poor, isolated suburbs as in Rome or Paris, he emphasized. ""The layout of the city has reinforced integration,"" he said. One can see what he means by what's not here. Stuttgart doesn't have ethnic enclaves. After World War II, Mercedes and Bosch erected hostels for guest workers. But by the 1970s, when Manfred Rommel became mayor, political and business leaders adopted a different tack, integrating migrants into existing communities in the city center. Stuttgart embraced a melting pot urbanism. Wilfried Porth, a member of the Daimler board and director of the company's labor relations, recalls Stuttgart as a dour place years ago. ""Then Italians and Spaniards and Turks brought cafe life to the streets,"" he said. ""Physically, tangibly, this became a much friendlier, more open city."" According to Mr. Porth, Daimler is now underwriting language training, job apprenticeships, and access to sports and other clubs so critical to the social fabric in Germany -- helping a wider effort to speed up the process of integration for new migrants. The hope is to avoid the mistake that West German and other European cities have made, enabling a kind of parallel culture of alienated guest workers to occupy isolated pockets of cities. ""We need, as quickly as possible, to integrate refugees into neighborhoods and provide them with skills and the capability to afford housing here,"" Mr. Porth said. That said, Daimler is not in the housing business, and Stuttgart, like Berlin, New York, London and Paris, faces a housing shortage. City leaders want to fight sprawl, but sky-high construction costs, Europe-wide environmental regulations that discourage tall buildings, an inviolable green belt around the city center and little land in public hands all make building new apartments here a struggle. Maybe the biggest long-term hurdle, though, is that Stuttgart needs new thinking about the shape and mix of its apartments. A disproportionate amount of new housing across the country is built for nuclear families, but according to the German Federal Institute of Demography, more than half of German city dwellers live alone. In ""Living Complex,"" Niklas Maak, an author and architecture critic for The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, points out that nuclear families today account for only 14 percent to 20 percent of households in big German cities like Berlin and Munich -- ""almost a marginal group,"" he notes, and yet ""this social development is hardly reflected in housing policies."" ""The forms of housing offered to the residents of a city have less and less to do with the life that takes place in them,"" Mr. Maak concludes. The influx of Muslim migrants who will want housing for extended families tips the scales even further out of whack. Christine Tritschler is a young urban planner in Stuttgart. ""It's a crisis the refugees don't create but make more acute,"" she said. ""There hasn't been nearly enough thinking about new housing types. More and more people want to live in the city center -- workers, students, families, older people -- in ways that current housing strategies don't address."" The issue isn't unique to Stuttgart. After reunification, Berlin's housing glut made that city a magnet for young people. A bounty of big, cheap apartments propelled Berlin's culture scene, but this accelerated gentrification. City officials failed to notice when the housing surplus became a deficit. Now Berlin's leaders are scrambling to provide 6,000 or more new affordable units a year. But what kind? A couple of recent housing projects by young architects there rethink the economics and configurations of apartment buildings. The designers -- Ifau and Jesko Fezer, Heide & Von Beckerath -- recently completed a six-story block called R50, with timber facade and wraparound balconies: a low-cost communal development that stressed shared spaces and flexible units. At the moment, Syrian refugees are occupying some of those shared spaces. The other project, called Spreefeld, is the work of a team of firms, Carpaneto, Fatkoehl and BAR. It mixes communal living with commercial and nonprofit offices, public green space and ground-floor common rooms. Refugees have found a haven in Spreefeld, too. The goal of the developer, Christian Schöning, is an affordable, adaptable, collaborative housing model, built in consultation with the neighborhood. It costs less per square foot to construct than what Berlin officials say is the city's least expensive new public housing. Just as important, the flexible, communal housing provides a potential model for a growing population of Muslim migrants with extended families who don't fit the nuclear model. ""We have to start thinking ahead 10 to 20 years,"" Mr. Schöning said. ""We can't only focus on the immediate crisis, because the population is changing the way we live, and this is a long-term issue."" In Stuttgart, Isabel Fezer, a deputy mayor, echoed the thought: ""Social and urban challenges go together,"" she said. ""In this city, we have lots of practice integrating people and have had few migrant-specific troubles as a result, but if we can't house everybody, then we will have social problems. Housing is the No. 1 issue."" ""The migrants are a challenge and an opportunity,"" she added. ""At this point, they're both. But they are here to stay. ""So we must make sure this becomes an opportunity, because it is our future.""

4134,1905104856.xml,"WASHINGTON -- World leaders vowed Friday to confront climate change in a new international coalition that no longer includes the United States government, moving quickly to reshape global environmental alliances after President Trump's decision to abandon the Paris climate accord.At the White House, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, declared that the president had ""nothing to be apologetic about"" after announcing his decision on Thursday. He hailed Mr. Trump's actions to ""put America's interests first"" and said that ""exiting Paris does not mean disengagement.""But in foreign capitals, and in communities across the United States that vowed to continue their efforts to combat the effects of climate change, that is exactly what Mr. Trump's withdrawal seemed to mean. International officials set in motion plans to leave the American government behind while they look for ways to stave off the direst consequences of the warming of the planet.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mr. Trump's actions ""will not deter all of us who feel obliged to protect this earth."" Koichi Yamamoto, the Japanese environment minister, told reporters that Mr. Trump had ""turned his back on the wisdom of human beings."" Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said the fight against climate change ""will continue with or without the United States.""Turning that message quickly into action, European Union leaders on Friday concluded a two-day summit meeting in Brussels with Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China -- a not-so-veiled diplomatic threat to Mr. Trump that Europe will find a partner to fight climate change, one way or another.""Today we are stepping up our cooperation on climate change with China, which means that today China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,"" Mr. Tusk said, calling Mr. Trump's actions on Thursday ""a big mistake.""Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indicated that her country was eager to jump into the void left by Mr. Trump's departure from the Paris accord. During a briefing in Beijing, Ms. Hua expressed support for the Paris Agreement and the need for global partnerships.""China is willing to enhance cooperation with all sides to together advance the follow-up negotiations on details of implementing the Paris Agreement and also advance its effective implementation,"" she said.In the United States, a group of mayors, governors, academics and business leaders began an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without the involvement of the federal government, and it is negotiating with the United Nations to submit a plan for reducing those emissions on its own.Before Mr. Trump's action this week, it would have made little sense for individual cities, states or businesses to try to negotiate climate change standards on their own. But less than 24 hours after the president's Rose Garden ceremony, leaders of the global effort to confront climate change welcomed that approach.Miguel Arias Cañete, the European Union's commissioner for climate action and energy, told reporters in Brussels that the European Union would continue carrying out the Paris Agreement with the assistance of a variety of American individuals, companies and authorities.""We will establish a dialogue within the United States with all the players that in the United States support ambitious climate change policies,"" he said.Mr. Trump's rebuke of the agreement, signed by 195 nations in 2015, deepened a trans-Atlantic rift laid bare during a recent NATO summit meeting in Brussels and a Group of 7 meeting in Italy, when the president lectured other leaders on trade, climate and military spending. On Thursday, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting Mr. Trump's assertion that he would renegotiate the climate accord.And officials around the world said they would press for the climate agreement to be respected regardless of the American decision. ""I can assure you, France will not give up the fight,"" President Emmanuel Macron said.American officials insisted on Friday that the United States was not abandoning efforts to fight climate change, even as several of the president's top aides refused to say whether Mr. Trump believed the idea of human-caused global warming was a hoax, as he has asserted in the past.Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the president would gauge the possibility of working with other world leaders and with Congress on ways to deal with climate change that safeguard the American economy.""He'll obviously continue to talk to world leaders,"" Mr. Spicer said. ""But that's a process that has to evolve.""Several administration officials stressed that the federal government would continue to try to reduce pollution, though Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, have made it a top priority to roll back many of President Barack Obama's aggressive emission-reduction efforts.""I don't think we're going to change our ongoing efforts to reduce those emissions in the future either, so hopefully people can keep it in perspective,"" Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said.Vice President Mike Pence asserted that the United States had demonstrated what he called ""real progress"" in reducing carbon emissions, and he accused liberal groups and Democratic lawmakers of trying to turn concern about the environment into a political cause.""It's long been a goal of the liberal left in this country to advance a climate change agenda,"" Mr. Pence said.But outside the United States, Mr. Trump's counterparts expressed deepening doubt about whether the world could depend on the United States government to help lead the way toward reduced pollution levels.Ms. Merkel spoke with Mr. Trump by telephone about the decision on Thursday, then gave a brief statement on Friday in Berlin that was broadcast live by German television stations.In tones similar to those of Mr. Macron, who on Thursday invited American scientists to continue their environmental work in his country, Ms. Merkel said, ""We will gather all our strength -- in Germany, in Europe and in the world -- to meet the great challenges of humanity, like climate change, and to successfully master these challenges.""With sweeping language the chancellor has rarely used in the past, she added, ""For all for whom the future of this planet is important, I say: Let us continue along this path together, so that we are successful for our Mother Earth.""Ms. Merkel, invoking her background as a scientist and a veteran of more than 20 years of international efforts to protect the planet, said it was especially important to help developing nations meet the challenges of global warming.""What we began over 20 years ago and continued in Paris one and a half years ago with a historic quantum leap will lead to success,"" Ms. Merkel said.She embraced the actions of companies and American states determined to carry out plans to safeguard the environment.""I am so moved and enthused that so many states and enterprises in the United States of America want to travel this path with us,"" she said. ""We will travel it together.""Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.Credit: MICHAEL D.

3305,1838562195.xml,"       A FEW YEARS AGO, a black-and-white photograph emerged of three young women walking along a dock with an expanse of sparkling water behind them. All were smiling and were naked, and soon after the picture appeared online, gleeful commenters across the web began insisting that the woman on the left was Angela Merkel. The German chancellor's office declined to comment, and while many now believe the photograph's association with Merkel to be a hoax, there's plenty of reason to think that Merkel, who grew up in a small East German town north of Berlin, came of age frolicking in the nude. It would hardly count as conspiracy theory. Public nakedness is common in the former G.D.R.: Of the 8 to 12 million nudists in Germany, the majority live in the east and are over 50 years old. One regularly observes men and women of all backgrounds -- from dull public servants to service workers to members of the German intelligentsia -- relaxing and socializing without any clothes. They read alone in the park or chat in groups at the beach; some prepare to swim, while others wash down bites of bratwurst with pilsner. They consider themselves members of an informal movement known as FKK, an abbreviation of Freikörperkultur, which translates to Free Body Culture. Despite the aggressive-sounding name, there is nothing confrontational or self-righteous or even erotic about it. Unlike in America, where public nudity typically has gay or countercultural connotations, in modern Germany it seems to have none. What began in the late 1800s as a kind of philosophy of physical health transformed, under authoritarian rule, into a mode of quasi-dissident leisure, and then later into something more temperate, a culturally ingrained but ultimately apolitical national pastime. SITUATED HALFWAY between Germany and Poland, the 40-mile-long Baltic Sea island of Usedom has, for decades, been a destination for those who prefer to enjoy their holidays exposed. They call it ""Berlin's bathtub."" Pine forests edge the shore, which is lined with spired, sugar-white resort hotels and studded with ingeniously adjustable wicker beach chairs that look like upright baby cradles. A rumor that in the village of Koserow one could see people grocery shopping and even going to the movie theater naked proved untrue, but the beach there, which is marked by a small hut selling pickled fish sandwiches and shots of caraway seed schnapps, was indeed marked FKK. The human terrain skewed elderly, stout and wurst-colored; the area was crowded despite an inhospitable chill that few American beachgoers would suffer through. Near the spot where my husband and I plopped down -- in our bathing suits, for now -- a married couple (aubergine-haired woman; uncircumcised man) began the afternoon collaborating on a crossword puzzle. He fell asleep in the sand -- prone, splayed like a starfish -- and she woke him up by prodding his gut with a foam noodle. Together they wandered into the bracing ocean, dove in and remained in the 50-degree water for over an hour. Nearby, a naked mother and her naked teenage daughter each ate two apples apiece, burying the cores beneath lumps of kelp. Some bathers appeared appropriately outfitted for the gusty climate and came equipped with nylon half-tents, which, when pitched perpendicular to the shore, provided wind protection but no privacy at all. Most others, though, seemed unperturbed by the weather. Those who were not swimming lay perfectly still, holding themselves steady not in pursuit of a golden complexion but in homage to some antiquated notion of fitness. Germans, known to credit oddly specific activities with salubrious effects (e.g. walking barefoot through damp grass), retain an atavistic faith in the advantages of full-body sun exposure, which was prescribed to tuberculosis patients in the late 19th century. ""Of course it's more healthy when it's 15 degrees out not to have a suit,"" a German musician told me, waving his hand with impatience. NACKTKULTUR, THE OTHER TERM by which Freikörperkultur once went, has a disputed etymology. Some allege it dates back to the natural healing movements of the late 19th century; others claim it was coined around 1900 by Heinrich Pudor, an author whose early books promoted a vegetarian, nudist lifestyle, and whose later work was almost exclusively anti-Semitic. Well into the 20th century, outdoor nudity was thought to cure respiratory illnesses. Membership in early German nudist clubs -- there were over 200 of them -- was evenly split between men and women, and by the end of the 1920s, there were almost as many books published on the subject as there were about sports and dance. Adolf Koch, a former schoolteacher who believed in nudity's pedagogical benefits, founded a network of nudist schools, and in 1929, the Berlin campus hosted the first International Congress on Nudity. FKK groups were initially banned by the Nazis, but the practice soon returned and was wanly tolerated throughout the Third Reich. When authorities began to patrol Baltic beaches in the 1950s to prohibit nudity, there was an outcry -- and many protests. The culture of FKK persisted after the war, and became a means of escape from a repressive state. I met an 86-year-old retired United Nations employee outside of Berlin who spoke of his youth in the wistful way people do when recalling periods of politically inflected happiness. ""We couldn't go to France and not to Italy,"" he told me, ""and so we went to the Baltic Sea or to a lake near Berlin and took off all our clothes and we were free."" The enthusiasm that today's FKKers feel for nudity is tinged with nostalgia for this feeling of evading oppression. But there isn't a bohemian subtext to the practice. On the beach in Usedom, I saw no tattoos or ethnic jewelry or patches of untrimmed hair. Instead, I saw people without tan lines, a fact that doctors apparently always note when treating FKK-beach-frequenting patients. There was cellulite, and stretch marks and ingrown hairs. Matronly nipples. Trembling paunches. Scars from cesarean sections and skin cancer scares. All the unsightly relics of life were there to see. It was grotesque at first, but with time -- and a beer -- the vista became lovable. Soon, it seemed not only vaguely embarrassing to be the only one in a bikini, but also unfair. I took it off. The removal was a nonevent. Nobody cared; my relative youth went unnoticed. The wind felt colder but the sun felt warmer. Whatever self-consciousness is inevitably induced by those few square inches of Lycra vanished. I read my book and buried my feet in the sand. I waded into the waves. My bathing suit, wilted there, in a threadbare pile slowly saturating the end pages of a dog-eared paperback, seemed suddenly despicable: lifeless, damp, maybe even diseased. That it was something I had once picked out, bought with money I earned, did not matter, though it was easy to imagine hating it even more had it been from some government-ordained fabric. Still, even in 2016 it seemed a relief from a lot: the puckered neon spandex, the oversize athletic logos, the irrepressible discomfort elicited by beachwear. That this austere freedom was enjoyed just minutes from the seashore hotels, all of them sites of unrelenting ornamental abundance, amplified the beach's virtues. The resorts, so pretty from the outside, had universally hideous interiors. Friends had warned me of it; they called it ""heavy."" The pastel palette made even luxuriously large lobbies feel like nursing homes. The wood was pickled, the glass embossed. Fake orchids decorated every surface. But it wasn't the result of negligence -- in fact everything was irritatingly fussy -- and it wasn't the result of a tight budget, for the production values were actually quite high. But the place was saturated with an incorrect, purely superficial interpretation of plenty: Two sunken pillows on the bed, for instance, were topped by a single red rose. In lieu of one decent buffet meat, one could enjoy eight mediocre ones. My husband, who is originally from Russia, observed all this with a sigh. He looked out at the chintzy dining room and was reminded of childhood holidays spent with his grandmother in Russian sanitariums -- industrial vacation destinations that looked like high-rise hospitals. He felt distinctly unwell realizing how similar this part of Germany looked to Russia. It was unnerving, even for me, to realize that after almost 30 years a political system -- not a cultural history -- could still be imposing bad taste. The next morning, as we sipped our coffees, I looked around the room and counted various pieces of decoration I despised, while my husband seemed to sink into a melancholy trance. ""They don't even know it's not supposed to be this way,"" he said. I told him he was being dramatic and suggested we go to the beach. We could go this second, I said, we didn't even need to change into our suits. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2,1856582804.xml,"       Hillary Clinton as New York City mayor? Imagine the fun: City building inspectors start to show up daily at Trump Tower, where they find a wobbly beam here, a missing smoke detector there, outdated wiring all over the place. City health inspectors fan out through Trump's hotels, writing citations for clogged drains in the kitchens and expired milk in the minibars. The potholes near his properties go unfilled. Those neighborhoods are the last to be plowed. There's a problem with the flow of water to his Bronx golf course, whose greens are suddenly brown. And the Russian Consulate keeps experiencing power failures. It's the darnedest thing. Clinton vows to look into it, just as soon as she returns from the Hamptons. She makes Alec Baldwin her cultural affairs commissioner, Alicia Machado the head of the city's office of food policy. She invites the Rockettes to perform at every official city event. Without any hand-wringing, all of them accept. And she's the belle of the international ball. When foreign dignitaries cycle through the United Nations, they make sure to drop by City Hall, especially because she was once the country's secretary of state. She winds up meeting with some of them more often than Trump does. He handles this as any grown-up in a position of extraordinary responsibility would, with crack-of-dawn tweets about what a lumpy loser Angela Merkel is and where he places her on a scale of 1 to Melania. ""Sad!"" he fumes, but Clinton couldn't be happier. His hometown is her fief. She's the boss of him whenever he's in the Big Apple, and he's in the Big Apple a whole lot. I'm fantasizing, yes, but with a glimmer of encouragement. On Wednesday Newsmax, a conservative outlet, reported that Democrats who couldn't abide the city's current mayor, Bill de Blasio, were courting Clinton to run against him in a Democratic primary this year and deny him a second term. The Times weighed in on Thursday, noting that speculation about a Clinton candidacy had been ""bubbling up for weeks"" and was intensifying. Neither source actually suggested that she'd follow through with this, and several prominent, well-connected Democrats assure me that it won't happen. So does my gut. Lofty as the perch of New York City mayor is, it's still a big comedown from what she had in her sights -- twice. By campaigning for it, she'd risk coming off as a has-been hankering for any old place at the table. And if she lost? Yikes. She'd be one of the starkest cases of dashed hopes and downward mobility in modern American politics. But she'd almost certainly beat de Blasio, and you have to admit that the idea of a Clinton mayoralty is genius. It's revenge, redemption and a chance for New Yorkers to be rescued from his shortcomings all in one. Also, Clinton can't spend the rest of her days in hiding and on nature walks. The woods around Chappaqua, N.Y., are lovely, dark and deep, but really. No one ever mistook her for a forest nymph. She's a creature of pavement, pantsuits and politics. Shouldn't she get back to all three? De Blasio's first term has been a turbulent mix of successes and frustrations. He delivered on his promise of universal prekindergarten for children in New York, and he put plans for affordable housing in motion. But to live here, as I do, is to notice deteriorations since the end of Mike Bloomberg's administration: public spaces that seem dirtier, subways that feel more packed, an apparent rise in the number of homeless people on the streets. De Blasio and aides of his are under investigation for their fund-raising activities, with grand jury decisions expected soon. Any indictments could open the door to several Democrats who have eyed the 2017 mayor's race and so far balked at jumping into it. But Clinton has assets that they don't: the name recognition, donors and intense popularity among New Yorkers to nullify de Blasio's strengths, no matter his legal fate. In the presidential election, 79 percent of New Yorkers voted for her over Trump. That she isn't actually a resident of the city doesn't matter, so long as she fixed that by the time voters headed to the polls. And she might be a terrific mayor. Bloomberg evidently thought so: Back when his 12 years in City Hall were ending, he tried to persuade her to succeed him. She weds a technocrat's love of details with an idealist's expansive gaze, befitting an assignment with concrete local responsibilities and ceremonial obligations that transcend New York. She'd get to shatter a glass ceiling: New York has not yet had a female mayor. Besides, there are so many scores she could settle, so many ways she could meddle. In vanquishing de Blasio, she'd be punishing someone whose endorsement of her in last year's Democratic presidential primary struck many Democrats as late and lackluster. She'd get back at Anthony Weiner, whose uncontrolled lust and unconcealed loins indirectly led to the F.B.I. director James Comey's disrupting the final weeks of her presidential campaign. Weiner once sought the mayoralty himself. Now he'd watch as his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, waltzed into and out of Gracie Mansion at Clinton's side, not his. Clinton would have a special role in the 2020 contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, because New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, is obviously angling for it. One of his favorite gubernatorial sports has been trying to crush de Blasio like a cockroach, but he'd have to play nice with her, given her political weight. How highly and readily she praised him would be a factor in his fate, and that would give her a leverage with the state that de Blasio doesn't have. She'd be the mayor of the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who lives in Brooklyn. So she'd be able to jockey for public attention with a showboat who has never exactly been a bosom buddy. But above all there'd be the torturing of Trump, who so gleefully tortures his own political foes and even some of his political friends. (Just ask Chris Christie.) Within a few months of her inauguration, the prevalence of his name on high-rises in Manhattan would pale next to the omnipresence of her face on billboards in all five boroughs. The city's Mexican Day Parade would be rerouted, from Madison Avenue over to Fifth, right past Trump Tower. A new city zoning experiment would locate detention centers in the strangest places. And in the city's libraries, ""The Art of the Deal"" would be impossible to find, while upfront, on vivid display, there'd be copies galore of ""It Takes a Village"" and ""Hard Choices."" Some choices aren't hard at all. Run, Hillary, run. I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on Facebook.

2890,578159946.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED Johannesburg   It began with a clunk off the post. Of course it did. Nothing has been easy and very little has ever been good for Spain in the World Cup, so it was no wonder that a promising moment, maybe a seminal moment, could be punctuated with a solid bounce off the left post.   This was no way for Spain to try to qualify for the first actual semifinal match in its otherwise glorious history. The home of Real Madrid, the land of Barcelona, had never played a semifinal. And now a sub named Pedro was bouncing a gimme off the post after a nifty pass from Andres Iniesta.   Spain is probably soccer's most underachieving nation. Make a list of the countries that have qualified for the semifinals -- both Turkey and South Korea in 2002 come to mind, and all right, South Korea was the host. But still, Spain had never been there. For Spain, something always hit the crossbar of life.   But this time, the ball deflected straight to David Villa, the hot man of this tournament for Spain, and he plunked it into the net in the 83rd minute for the only goal of the night, the goal that put Spain where it has never been.   It took a kick save from Iker Casillas, the great Spanish keeper, to protect that lead in the  closing minutes of the 1-0 victory over Paraguay. Now Spain will play Germany in one semifinal on Wednesday in Durban after the Netherlands plays Uruguay in the other semifinal in Cape Town on Tuesday.   ""We are proud to be here,"" said Pepe Reina, the backup goalkeeper who plays for Liverpool and speaks English. ""And we are still hungry. Now we play Germany, the best team in the tournament.""   With all that talent, now so visible on the television screens around the world, Spain has been a popular and potential semifinalist for the past generation. But there are more potential semifinalists than can fit into that tight little quadrangular box.   Two other A-list teams went out in the past two days -- Brazil fell on  Friday when its sturdy defense failed it, and Argentina was demolished on Saturday in a shocking 4-0 loss to Germany. Now Diego Maradona can take off his genius suit and get back into his comfortable track suit.   Everything is relative about the World Cup. Spain versus Paraguay seemed like a quarterfinal -- a nervous-making quarterfinal, to be sure. Paraguay played defense and not much offense, the kind of soccer that makes people want to perform the wave or blow into a vuvuzela or go out for a sausage.     But Paraguay was also tough and resourceful, more than enough to make the bad old things happen all over again to often quivery Spain.   Germany versus Argentina, earlier in the day, seemed like a semifinal -- two once and no doubt future champions colliding too soon.   The third goal sent Chancellor Angela Merkel virtually stutter-stepping around the dignitaries' tribune almost like a majorette from a marching band.   The Germans never seem to have a down era, although the record insists they went out in the quarterfinals in 1994 and 1998. All the firepower on Maradona's team meant nothing because the Germans put up a perimeter defense and dared the Argentines to skitter around the edges and try to crack the code. Once in a while, the Germans went out and got a goal.   Some nations I could mention would just love to reach the quarterfinals as a measure of their growth; other nations dread the quarterfinals as a treacherous hurdle. Brazil and Argentina will not have happy flights across the Atlantic.   For Spain, playing Paraguay was like a required exercise, like in figure skating. And Spain has a history of slipping on the mandatory jumps.   The only time Spain finished in the top four was in 1950, when it qualified for a four-team round robin and finished last.   The Spanish were elbowed out by Italy in a quarterfinal in Massachusetts in 1994 and outrun by Nigeria in the group stage in Nantes, France, in 1998. And its fans are still smarting over South Korea in 2002 and the officiating that allowed the surging Reds of the host nation to advance to the semifinals.   In recent years, the Spanish talent has been familiar around the world. The Spaniards won the European championship in 2008, a wonderful tournament, but players often become old or sated or unlucky in the two years leading to the World Cup. But Spain remains the most enjoyable team in the world to watch, at least for soccer lovers who are not tied up emotionally in its jittery fortunes.   On Saturday, Spain handled the ball beautifully -- 19 touches on one sequence in the second half, opening up the field. But everything Spain does has the tradition of disaster behind it. Casillas saved a penalty kick. Xabi Alonso made a penalty kick, but it was nullified because the referee detected a Spanish player in the area. On the replay, Justo Villar guessed right and stopped Alonso.   Any American baseball fan would think of the hideous disasters that have befallen the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs in the past. But Spain had enough talent, enough maturity, to play through the disappointment and collect its goal on one ultimate break. For the first time ever, Spain more than looks like a semifinalist; it is a semifinalist.   Correction: July 7, 2010, Wednesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Sports of The Times column on Sunday, about the goal that sent Spain to its first World Cup semifinal match, misidentified the round in which Spain lost to Nigeria in the 1998 tournament. It lost in the group stage, not the Round of 16.   GEORGE VECSEY           E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com         Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Who Played a Key Role, at the End of Spain's 1-0 Victory.

2191,2411988800.xml,"A history of discrimination has been brought to the surface. But so far, charges of systemic racism have been met mostly with official denial.PARIS -- The killing of George Floyd has resonated in Europe, drawing thousands of demonstrators into the streets of cities like Paris, London and Berlin. Statues of colonizers and slave traders have been pulled down or defaced.The message has been one of solidarity with protesters in the United States -- but also a call to look at racism at home.The protesters' cries have brought to the surface a history of discrimination, especially regarding police tactics, which are now being vigorously challenged in countries like France, Germany and Britain. Demonstrators have invoked the names of past victims of police violence in their own countries, while demanding that institutional racism be redressed.So far, no matter where charges of systemic racism have been leveled, they have been met mostly with firm official denial.""France, the national police, the gendarmerie, they are not racist,"" the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, insisted in Parliament on Tuesday.Yet available statistics, and the experience of Europe's minority populations, often tell a different story, one that has proliferated with successive waves of immigration -- like Britain's Windrush Generation, which arrived from the Caribbean after World War II, or the recent influx of nearly a million asylum seekers to Germany.In France, the problems are perhaps most acute, given a longstanding failure to fully integrate Muslim and African populations from its former colonies. The French police, a largely white force, routinely target African and Arab youths for identity checks and have a long track record of abusive arrests as well as deaths of minorities in custody.""The list is too long,"" Assa Traoré told a crowd of demonstrators outside a Paris courthouse last week, reciting the names of those who died in encounters with the police.Her brother, Adama Traoré, was one of them. He died in 2016 after being arrested by three police officers, one of whom later acknowledged that they had placed ""the weight of all of our bodies"" on him. No charges have ever been filed in his case, despite four years of investigations and dueling autopsies.""Justice for Adama!"" shouted the crowd of some 20,000 people who gathered to hear Ms. Traoré speak, filling the sprawling plaza in numbers that surprised the French government, which had sought a ban.The demonstrators themselves said it: America's turmoil has erased an inhibition in France. ""We needed what happened in the U.S. to make it happen here,"" said Junior Tidiane, a 20-year-old student. ""The influence of the United States is vital.""Despite its own troubles, the United States has civil rights law that can sometimes be used to prosecute abuses against members of minority groups. But in France, the authorities have long made it a deliberate practice not to keep statistics of almost any kind based on race or religion, ostensibly to forge a common national identity.Officially, there are no minorities, only French citizens.""Don't forget who we are: the French people, unified"" in ""republican liberty and equality,"" the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said at a news conference on Monday.""The police, the gendarmes, they are the guardians of our republic,"" said Mr. Castaner, often referred to in the French media as ""France's Top Cop"" because he directs the national police force. He said that ""there are no racist institutions, there are only republican institutions,"" and that bad actors should not be allowed to ""throw opprobrium on our institutions.""Germany's interior minister, Horst Seehofer, took a similar stance. When Saskia Esken, a leader of the Social Democrats, demanded action against ""latent racism"" in the country's police departments, Mr. Seehofer rejected the notion as ""completely incomprehensible.""The police union and some other conservative politicians also insisted that instances of racism in the ranks were isolated, though recent federal anti-discrimination legislation suggests otherwise.""The Americans have not really solved the issue of race discrimination since the abolition of slavery,"" said Friedrich Merz, one of three conservatives hoping to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel next year. ""In Germany, we don't have the same problem -- and there is no latent racism in the police, either.""But Germany's record is, in fact, blighted.A rejected Sudanese asylum seeker, Aamir Ageeb, died while being deported on a Lufthansa flight in 1999. Police officers had tied his arms to the armrests, bound his legs and put a motorcycle helmet on his head. When Mr. Ageeb screamed, officers pressed down on his torso and head for minutes. His autopsy later revealed ""death by asphyxiation due to massive exposure to violence.""In the summer of 2018, a Syrian refugee, Amad Ahmad, was kept in a German prison even after prosecutors confirmed that he had been wrongly detained. He died in September that year after setting his own cell on fire.But neither Germany's interior ministry nor its federal police collect statistics on deaths in custody, and there are no representative studies systematically analyzing racism in the police.""We don't have the same history as the United States,"" said Klaus Weinhauer, a history professor and police specialist at Bielefeld University. ""But we should not allow problems like racism also in its institutionalized forms to grow by not having an honest debate about them.""In Britain, the protests have revived anger over police killings of members of minority groups, among them Mark Duggan, who was shot and killed in 2011 by an officer in north London. A jury found that Mr. Duggan was unarmed at the time, but that he had been lawfully killed. A court rejected an appeal by his mother. The police had said they believed he was planning an attack.""Who killed Mark Duggan?"" demonstrators chanted at a recent protest in London. ""The police killed Mark Duggan.""The police in England and Wales are considerably more likely to use force against black people than against those who are white or Asian -- including with firearms, batons and irritant spray -- and they have long subjected them to higher rates of stops and searches, according to figures from the Home Office.Racial profiling by the police in parts of Europe has long been a common practice. For many, that has meant a daily ordeal of harassment and identity check.""The police in France have demonstrated that they discriminate,"" said Sebastian Roché, a leading expert on the French police at the National Center for Scientific Research, the CNRS. But the government, he said in an interview, is in a ""strategy of refusing reality.""If any more proof were needed, several harrowing videos that have emerged recently captured abusive police behavior in the heavily immigrant Paris suburbs during the coronavirus lockdown.""Up until the last few days, there was an incredible taboo over this, really hallucinatory,"" said Bénédicte Jeannerod, director in France of Human Rights Watch.The cases were not isolated, said Ms. Jeannerod, whose organization is about to release a report on discriminatory behavior in the French police. ""This is about a daily, routine practice -- people targeted because of their skin color,"" she said.Some 80 percent of ""young men perceived as black or Arab"" said they had been subjected to police identity checks, according to a 2017 report by the French state civil liberties guardian, the Défenseur des Droits. They also reported being roughed up and insulted by the police at far higher rates.""Today, differences in treatment linked to origins, in relations between the police and the population, are widely acknowledged,"" the Défenseur des Droits wrote in a recent report.One young Parisian, Rayan Bardakji, recalled being insulted by the police after an identity check. He was one of 17 teenagers of African or Arab origin who filed a rare criminal complaint against police in the 12th Arrondissement of Paris for repeated, abusive identity stops.""They would hit me, throw me up against the wall, slap me,"" Mr. Bardakji recalled. ""They would strip us, and hit us,"" he said. One officer assaulted him sexually with his hand. ""They would drag us to the police station, for nothing,"" Mr. Bardakji, now 20, said in an interview.In 2018, three of the officers were given five-month suspended sentences and ordered to pay fines totaling $2,250 to two of the plaintiffs.""There are very few consequences for police who engage in these sorts of practices,"" Ms. Jeannerod said.A ranking police officer in Paris said that several years ago, he was ordered to stop Arab and African youth in a central Paris arrondissement solely on the basis of their ethnic origin.""I was told: 'It's simple. In this arrondissement, you will stop blacks and Arabs. You can easily recognize them,""' the officer said in an interview this week. He requested anonymity for fear of reprisals from his colleagues.""This was obviously illegal,"" the officer said. He refused the order, and wound up successfully appealing administrative sanctions leveled at him.Despite this, he insisted that the police force as a whole was not racist, occasional ""racist remarks"" notwithstanding. He noted the existence of his own minority colleagues -- though in a brigade of 30, he estimated that only five were people of color.Last week, Mr. Castaner, the interior minister, asked the Paris prosecutor to look into French media reports of Facebook groups in which officers appear to regularly make racist remarks.""Police checks for no reason -- we're used to it, it's our daily routine,"" said Yassin Taamourt, a 30-year-old warehouse worker in the Paris suburb of Les Ulis.A video widely circulated online graphically illustrates Mr. Taamourt's recent run-in with the police, which left him with a black eye and a big bump on his forehead.""As I was coming out of my building, they told me to come back inside, and they beat me up,"" Mr. Taamourt said. ""They smashed my head against the wall three times. And they hit me in the nose with the butt of a flash-ball gun."" He has hired a lawyer.""In France, there is an incredible denial of the problem,"" said Ms. Jeannerod of Human Rights Watch. ""It's been shifting in the last few days, but only in the last few days. We'll just have to see if we really are in a moment of change.""Katrin Bennhold and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and Benjamin Mueller from London.Police officers in Berlin last month.

2008,1759079890.xml,"       LONDON --  More than 40 people -- including 17 children -- died when two wooden boats full of migrants trying to reach Greece sank early Friday morning, as a continued flow of asylum seekers, even in dangerous winter weather, put new pressure on European leaders to address a crisis that seems likely to intensify again come spring. The authorities said the two boats had sunk near Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea as they carried migrants from Turkey toward Greece. The Greek Coast Guard rescued dozens of survivors and was continuing to search the area by sea and air, The Associated Press reported. Greece is the most popular entry point into Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Almost 37,000 migrants are reported to have arrived in Greece and Italy by sea and land this month, according to the International Organization for Migration, 10 times the number in the same period last year. In the first three weeks of this year, at least 113 people died trying to make the sea crossing to Europe, the agency said, compared with 94 for all of January last year. Despite the evidence that migrants from the Middle East and Africa are continuing to flee war and poverty in their home countries and will strike out to Europe again in huge numbers this year, European leaders have taken no major new steps to curb the flow. Nor have they agreed on a comprehensive border policy or prepared for another influx that could rival last year's, when more than a million asylum seekers reached the Continent, many of them headed to Germany. Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France issued a stark warning in an interview broadcast on Friday about the future of a unified Europe, saying the very idea was under threat unless the Continent could protect its borders. Speaking to the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Valls said the Continent could not accommodate the enormous numbers of migrants and warned that they could destabilize European societies. ""If Europe is not capable of protecting its own borders, it's the very idea of Europe that will be questioned,"" he said. ""Europe has forgotten that borders are required."" The Schengen zone, which permits largely unchecked movement across most of the Continent and was described by Mr. Valls as ""one of the great European projects,"" has been under severe strain as countries have introduced border controls aimed at stemming the flow of migrants. Over the summer, Hungary erected a razor-wire fence on its border with Croatia. This month, Sweden, once one of the most welcoming of nations for refugees, introduced identity checks for travelers arriving from Denmark in an effort to curb their numbers. Austria announced this week that it would limit the number of refugees it takes in this year to 37,500, down from 90,000 in 2015. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has come under increasing pressure at home and abroad for the country's more welcoming approach to refugees. Mr. Valls, while acknowledging that she had ""courage,"" said, ""The first message we need to send now, with the greatest firmness, is to say that we will not welcome all the refugees in Europe."" Ms. Merkel met on Friday with Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, the latest in a series of discussions between the countries about what more Turkey could do to keep the refugees pouring over its border with Syria from traveling on to Western Europe. Ms. Merkel again promised that the European Union would find 3 billion euros, about $3.2 billion, to assist Turkey in offering work and schooling to more than two million Syrians who have fled there. Mr. Davutoglu made no concrete promises in return, making clear that Ankara believes it has leverage in negotiations on the issue with Europeans -- like Ms. Merkel -- who dragged out European Union membership talks with Turkey in the past, in part because of concern over human rights abuses in Turkey. ""We are not begging for the E.U. money,"" Mr. Davutoglu told the German news agency DPA. ""The 3 billion euros are only there to show the political will to share the burden."" President Obama offered backing for Ms. Merkel on Thursday, telling her that the United States would provide ""substantial"" support to efforts to ease the refugee crisis stemming from the conflict in Syria before an international donors conference to address the issue next month, Ms. Merkel's office said in a statement. Ms. Merkel is one of the hosts of the donor conference, which will take place in London on Feb. 4. ""The president said that the U.S. administration would take part in a substantial way,"" her office said. At the World Economic Forum, Secretary of State John Kerry said Mr. Obama would work to increase global humanitarian funding at a United Nations summit meeting this fall and expand the number of nations taking refugees.

3972,1555206663.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDMOSCOW -- Sanat Parmanova arrived at Moscow's flagship McDonald's just off Pushkin Square on Thursday evening as a woman on a mission. Her friend Svetlana Toktorbayeva was carrying a takeout bag of wings from KFC, but Ms. Parmanova had a different dinner in mind: a double cheeseburger, country-style fries, cheese sauce and a medium Coke, no ice. Alas, it seemed politics had denied her craving. The door was locked. The restaurant, which in some years has been the busiest McDonald's in the world, was dark. A small sign said: ""The public eating-establishment of fast service is closed for technical reasons. We apologize for the inconvenience."" Ms. Parmanova's shoulders drooped in a dejected harrumph. ""I heard that they were going to shut down McDonald's restaurants because of the conflict with the U.S.,"" she said. ""I didn't think it would be so soon."" The Pushkin Square restaurant -- a symbol of the thawing of the Cold War when it became the first McDonald's in the Soviet Union, in 1990 -- was one of four in Moscow that the Russian government ordered closed on Wednesday. The official reason given by Rospotrebnadzor, the country's consumer protection agency, was ""numerous violations of the sanitary code."" Ms. Parmanova and other would-be customers did not buy it for a minute, insisting that the bitter conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine was to blame. ""It's political,"" she said. ""If they really cared about people's health, they wouldn't have allowed it to open in the first place. It's only because of a conflict between the presidents that it has been shut down."" Maybe President Vladimir V. Putin doesn't like hamburgers? ""Putin doesn't like Obama,"" Ms. Parmanova shot back. Never mind that McDonald's has 435 restaurants in Russia that employ more than 37,000 people; that, according to the company, 85 percent of its products in Russia come from Russian suppliers; or that in 2011, it won an award as the country's best employer. In the mind of the Kremlin, the Big Mac -- or Beeg Mak, as it's ordered here -- is still more American than apple pie, which Russians sometimes call sharlotka and regard as about as American as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. ""It is just a political reaction -- Putin's reaction,"" declared Veronika Kolbasina. Ms. Kolbasina, 56, recalled standing in line for two hours to get into the restaurant on the day it opened: Jan. 31, 1990. She went with her son, then a little boy. He is now 30. ""It was a hamburger with real meat,"" Ms. Kolbasina said. She added that she had kept paper cups from her first McDonald's meal, and that when she heard that some were being closed, she ran to the nearest one and ate a Caesar salad. ""My favorite salad,"" she said, pulling the clean, empty bowl from her purse. ""I decided to keep it in case the whole chain is shut down."" The government said that the four closed restaurants, including one in Manezh Square just outside the Kremlin walls, had failed sanitary inspections carried out this week. Officials denied on Thursday that American fast-food chains were being singled out or that there were plans for sweeping inspections of them. Some Russian news outlets, however, reported that additional inspections were already underway at McDonald's restaurants across Russia. McDonald's issued a statement in Russia saying that it was studying the government's complaints and working to reopen the restaurants as quickly as possible. ""We always impeccably follow the regulations and laws of the Russian Federation,"" the company said. Independent analysts noted that the seemingly politically motivated decision to shut down outlets of a major business might not be in Russia's interests. ""Not very clever given that a lot of the product from these operations is sourced from local farms in and around Moscow,"" said Timothy Ash, a market analyst at Standard Bank in London who closely follows Russia and Ukraine. Political analysts have similarly warned that it might not be in Russia's interests to support an armed separatist rebellion right alongside the Russian border in eastern Ukraine. But bigger geopolitical imperatives seem to be driving things, regardless of the affection Muscovites profess for McDonald's -- including for a number of menu items, like the Freshburger with Parmesan or the Beef Roll, that are mostly unheard-of in the United States. Among the disappointed customers looking through the locked door of the McDonald's on Pushkin Square were Svetlana Fomina and her children, Gordey, 7, and Alisa, 4, in search of burgers and fries. ""For me, it's a positive company -- I worked there when I was a student,"" Ms. Fomina said, as a young man in a Yale University T-shirt rolled up on a skateboard and took a peek into the darkened restaurant. ""America, for some reason, meddles into Russia's affairs,"" Ms. Fomina added. ""What's their business here? They've got their own continent. We and Ukrainians are one nation. We don't go there to say, 'Why are you abusing Mexicans?' "" Still, she said: ""Politics and business should not be mixed. I want American jeans because those are good ones. I think they shouldn't have closed McDonald's because everyone eats there. There is nothing criminal."" At the McDonald's on Gazetny Pereulok not far from Red Square, still open and crowded, Sofia Zalesskaya, 17, a high school student, said McDonald's offered good food at affordable prices, and good Wi-Fi. ""Drinking vodka, which the whole country does, is much worse for health than eating French fries and chicken,"" Ms. Zalesskaya said. The restaurants in Moscow are not the first fast-food casualties in the deepening conflict over Ukraine. McDonald's closed its three restaurants in Crimea after Russia invaded and annexed the peninsula in March. On Wednesday, the prime minister of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said the restaurants were not missed. ""We will be healthier,"" Mr. Aksyonov told reporters in Simferopol, the Crimean capital, according to the Interfax news service. ""This food does not suit. Look at people who regularly eat McDonald's food. Some of them have to turn sideways to squeeze through a door frame."" At the Pushkin Square McDonald's, Ms. Parmanova, the 21-year-old safety engineering student who had been looking forward to a double cheeseburger, said that frequent meals at McDonald's had not had adverse effects on her figure. Wearing a body-clinging white minidress, she gestured dramatically at her bare, taut thigh. ""Even though I look slim, I eat here quite often,"" she said. ""Maybe later, with age, the effect will be more noticeable, cellulite and all that."" She added, ""People say that this is plastic food, that this is very unhealthy, but I like it very much.""

1912,1713720473.xml,"       PASSAU, Germany --  As Germany struggles with a surge of migrants and has at least temporarily clamped down on new arrivals, Nematullah Jasor may serve as a symbol of the way forward. One afternoon last week, Mr. Jasor, 22, walked with a light step around the cavernous factory floor of ZF Friedrichshafen, a large German industrial company that recently hired him as an apprentice in this small town on the border with Austria that has become a major landing point for migrants. Just a few years earlier, Mr. Jasor faced threats on his life back home in Afghanistan, where Taliban insurgents had threatened to kill him if he did not join the group and stop his computer science studies at the local university. After learning German quickly and proving to be a skilled employee, Mr. Jasor is on track for a permanent job once he completes his apprenticeship in making machine and auto parts. More than any other European country now contending with an influx of migrants and refugees, Germany -- with Europe's biggest economy, an aging population and more than a half-million unfilled jobs -- sees the migration wave as not only a challenge but an opportunity. ""Germany will benefit from people like Nematullah,"" said Roland Biebl, Mr. Jasor's supervisor. ""It's in everyone's interest to integrate them."" Although Germany has temporarily placed tight controls on the border across the country's south to stem the tide of people seeking asylum, the government is intent on assimilating those it lets in. With at least 800,000 migrants expected this year alone, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the nation's biggest businesses have been mounting a vocal campaign to get migrants into jobs as a way of quickly integrating them into German society. Rather than risk letting the migrants become wards of the state, the idea is to help as many as possible start contributing to the economy. Advocates of fast-tracking employment say that Germany, Europe's largest economy, has enough jobs to accommodate the flood of new arrivals -- and in fact is facing the threat of a labor shortage and a growing bill for pensions and health care, as more and more of the country's aging population reaches retirement. Refugees like Mr. Jasor, as well as many asylum-seekers who have arrived from Syria, are educated and bring employable skills that could help ease the labor squeeze. Last week, big employers including Deutsche Post and the automaker Daimler called for an overhaul of German labor laws to let asylum-seekers get to work quickly. Ms. Merkel, who met with industry leaders, announced that Germany would accelerate the asylum process and make it easier for those allowed to stay to enter the work force. An additional 2 billion euros, or nearly $2.3 billion, will be spent to help people learn German, which is essential for any job. On Monday, Germany's four main employers' associations said they supported the government's decision to temporarily slow the flow of migrants to avoid burdening the asylum system. But in a joint statement, the organizations, which represent hundreds of thousands of companies, renewed the call to give approved migrants faster access to the labor market and to language and skills training. ""That is the best way for permanent integration,"" the organizations said in the statement. Some Germans fear that the influx could threaten their own jobs and drive wages down. Recently, Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front party in France, accused Ms. Merkel of encouraging immigration to ""recruit slaves."" But political proponents and many businesses see an opportunity to welcome a wave of motivated, mostly younger people into the German labor force. ""There is something to be said about thinking of refugees not just as victims but as potential contributors to societies and economies in the future,"" said Elizabeth Collett, a policy fellow at the Migration Policy Institute Europe, based in Brussels.  Despite a five-year economic crisis in Europe, unemployment in this country of 82 million is at a 30-year low of 4.6 percent. Nearly 597,000 jobs are open in health and hospice care, engineering, carpentry, fast food -- the list goes on. Analysts said Germans and other European nationals were not filling those jobs because they did not have the right experience or education or, in the case of low-skilled work, because they did not want the jobs. The labor shortage has persisted even after tens of thousands of young people from Greece, Spain and other crisis-hit eurozone economies have flocked to Germany in recent years to find employment. ""We don't see evidence that refugees will be stealing jobs,"" said Alexander Wilhelm, a labor market expert at the Confederation of German Employers' Associations. ""We have record-high underemployment and record-high job openings. So for the moment, the labor market is capable of giving new opportunities."" Ms. Merkel and many German companies say change is possible. They point to the reunification of East and West Germany and Germany's previous absorption of European migrants during difficult economic circumstances. That has not always worked seamlessly. In the 1960s, ""guest worker"" programs bringing Turks and others to fill factory labor shortages stoked friction and gave rise to ethnic enclaves. And not everyone has the requisite skills. Of the migrants who settled in Germany from 1985 to 2013, for example, 73 percent of men and 48 percent of women wound up working, compared with 83 percent of men and 73 percent of women in the total German labor force, according to the Cologne Institute of Economic Research. Migrants coming in now from the Middle East may take longer to learn German or adapt to European culture, making the transition more difficult, the institute added. Others may be suffering trauma from war and their harrowing odyssey to Europe. Whether the push to employ asylum-seekers proves more than a token gesture remains to be seen. So far, few German companies have hired more than a handful of migrants. Daimler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, told German news outlets last week that the migrants coming now were the kind of workers the country needed. But his company had taken just four migrants into vocational jobs, a spokesman said, in a work force of nearly 169,000. Other companies are doing a bit more. Two hours northwest of Passau, the German industrial giant Siemens started a pilot project in the spring, taking 10 migrants from Syria and elsewhere as interns at its Erlangen operation, which has 33,000 employees. This autumn, it plans to expand the program to nine sites around the country. At ZF, which has 49,000 workers in Germany and is the largest employer in Passau, Mr. Jasor is the only refugee to be hired. There are no immediate plans to seek others, since the company, a powerhouse in gears and transmissions, has plenty of skilled applicants, said Gernot Hein, a spokesman. But that could change, he said, especially with Ms. Merkel leading the charge. ""We see it as a freedom project,"" Mr. Hein said. ""We must include refugees in the labor force and not just leave them on the street."" That view has made Mr. Jasor fall in love with Germany. After fleeing Afghanistan in 2011, he took a perilous route through Iran and then Turkey, where he worked odd jobs and studied German using a Turkish textbook. Later, a smuggler helped get him through Eastern Europe to the border of Germany. ""I've been through so many countries, and Germany has the best people,"" said Mr. Jasor, a sunny, soft-spoken man who teared up as he thought of the parents he had left behind in Afghanistan. ""No one has made me feel like an outsider."" Mr. Jasor, who is Muslim, prays regularly, but his German colleagues do not seem to mind, he said. Out of curiosity, he went to Mass one Sunday at a local church, and he has returned several times since to learn more about Christianity and to make friends. After his shift at ZF ended one recent afternoon, Mr. Jasor made his way to the migrant home where he lives on the outskirts of Passau. As an apprentice, he now earns 945 euros a month before taxes, and he pays 208 euros a month to rent a small room, instead of having the government continue to subsidize it for him. On the floor, a thin blue mattress lay next to a black carpet adorned with a red rose. A rickety desk held German language books, which Mr. Jasor studies at night. The verdant, rolling hills flanking the Danube rise into view through his small window. Outside, a cacophony of voices filled the air; 95 migrants from Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and other countries crowded the other rooms, and rows of strollers and laundry racks lined the hallway. On this day, community volunteers took the migrants for a cruise on the Danube to see the sights, and now they had gathered on the ground floor to discuss the trip in German. Mr. Jasor, one of the few who had a job, could not take the tour. But that was fine with him. ""I want to work,"" he said. ""That is my dream. I will save money to get my own apartment and have a family."" He gazed out the window toward the warm, setting sun. ""This is my future,"" Mr. Jasor said. ""My future is Germany.""

455,2571546550.xml,"Several hundred women wore the head-to-toe garments at a pro-Taliban demonstration on Sept. 11. The march was a reminder of how after years of war, Afghanistan's women are again at the mercy of the militants.Hundreds of women, many wearing full-length robes, their faces obscured by black veils, filled the auditorium of a Kabul university on Saturday holding signs -- many of them in English -- in support of the Taliban and its strict interpretation of Islam, including separate education for men and women.The Taliban said the demonstration at Shaheed Rabbani Education University, which followed anti-Taliban protests last week by Afghan women demanding equal rights, was organized by female university lecturers and students.Reporters on the street near Saturday's march were kept away from the protesters by Taliban fighters armed with automatic rifles and were not allowed to speak with any of the women. Later attempts to reach the participants through social media or the university went unanswered.The demonstration, held on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, served as a stark reminder of how despite two decades and more than $780 million spent promoting women's rights, after the departure of American forces last month, the women of Afghanistan could be thrown back decades, if not centuries.When the Taliban governed Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, it barred women and girls from holding most jobs and going to school, and practically made them prisoners in their own homes. In public, women were forced to wear the burqa, a tentlike garment that covers them from head to toe, with a crocheted mesh grill over the eyes. Its use to erase the appearance of women from public life was seen in the West as a symbol of Taliban oppression.The demonstration ofwomen wearing head-to-toe garments and face coverings on the 9/11 anniversary was a sharp rebuke to the United States and its allies, which long cited women's rights as a reason for continuing the war in Afghanistan long after the Taliban was toppled, Al Qaeda was defanged and Osama bin Laden was assassinated.Many of the women appeared to be wearing a form of dress familiar to conservative Muslims in Southern Afghanistan, including a veil, while others wore the more traditional blue burqa.Since the United States and its allies departed Kabul on Aug. 30, leaving Afghanistan under the control of the Taliban, the country's women have been at the forefront of protests demanding that their rights continue to be respected.Taliban leaders have responded to those protests with violence, beating participants, including women, and insisting that anyone taking to the streets for a public demonstration must first be granted approval from their caretaker government.The Ministry of Education of the acting Taliban government said that the women at Saturday's pro-Islamist demonstration had asked for and received their permission to hold the event.""Unlike other demonstrations in Kabul, this is the second all-women protest which was nonviolent and the journalists were allowed to cover the protest freely,"" the ministry said in a statement.""The women also welcomed the scheme of separate classes for boys and girls in all universities and institutes and pledged that they would be working for strengthening the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan,"" the ministry said.But the presence of Taliban fighters, the efficiency with which images of the event and official statements were disseminated and its timing -- on Sept. 11 -- suggest that the demonstration was not just approved by the Taliban but potentially orchestrated by it.Standing at a podium decorated with large white flags, some of the women taking part in Saturday's demonstration criticized the recent anti-Taliban protests, insisting that women should go along with the Taliban's strict policy that women wear a full-body covering.One woman said anti-Taliban protesters joined last week's marches just to become famous in the West, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times.She acknowledged that those women held important roles in society, including doctors and teachers, but said they do not represent all of the women of Afghanistan.After the women filed out of the auditorium, they held a short march, chanting in support of the Taliban and brandishing signs, including several in English that read, ""Women who left Afghanistan cannot represent us,"" and ""Our rights are protected in Islam.""Taliban fighters cleared traffic so that rented buses could transport the women from the university grounds.Even before the Taliban returned to power, Afghanistan placed near the bottom of every list when it came to protections for women, and at the top in terms of the need for shelters, counseling and courts that could help keep women safe.Nevertheless, after 20 years of Western support, girls and women made up about 40 percent of all students in the country. Women joined the military and the police, and held political office. Some became internationally recognized singers, competed at the Olympics and on robotics teams, climbed mountains and more -- all things that were nearly impossible at the turn of the century.But many of those women, seeing no future for themselves, have fled the country. A women's soccer team from Herat made its way to Italy, five members of the Afghan girls' robotics team landed in Mexico, and Zarifa Ghafari, one of Afghanistan's first female mayors, arrived in Germany, where she recently met with Chancellor Angela Merkel.Ms. Ghafari expressed outrage at the images of the women at the university in Kabul on Saturday. ""This isn't our culture!"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Afghan women aren't part of extremism, don't make them savage, don't impose ISIS culture on us!""When the Taliban announced their caretaker government on Tuesday, leaders in the West noted that it failed to live up to promises that the group would be more inclusive of Afghanistan's diverse ethnic groups and religious minorities. It was also made up entirely of men, breaking with another pledge by Taliban leaders.Hours before the acting government was announced, hundreds of Afghans, women among them, took to the streets to peacefully demand that their rights be respected under their new leaders. Taliban fighters used rifle butts and sticks to violently break up the protest, sending participants fleeing.On Wednesday, two Afghan journalists were detained and violently assaulted for covering a protest in Kabul. Photos showed the backsides of both reporters covered with bruises and gashes from being whipped repeatedly with cables, sparking an international outcry.Reporting was contributed by Sami Sahak and Wali Arian Reporting was contributed by Sami Sahak and Wali ArianA Taliban fighter guarding women, many of them fully robed, during Saturday's march in Kabul in support of the new Afghan government and its strict views of Islam.

3725,2474093536.xml,"The agreement, which would roll back restrictions on investment, faces some opposition in Europe and objections from the Biden camp.Chinese and European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday to make it easier for companies to operate on each other's territory, a significant geopolitical victory for China when criticism of its human rights record and handling of the pandemic have left it increasingly isolated.But political opposition in Europe and Washington could ultimately derail the landmark pact, illustrating the difficulties of dealing with an authoritarian superpower that is both an economic rival and a lucrative market.A large faction in the European Parliament, which must ratify the agreement before it can take effect, opposes the accord on the grounds that it does not do enough to stop human rights abuses in China. In addition, a top aide to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has signaled that the incoming administration is not happy with the deal.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has made the agreement a priority because of its importance to German carmakers and other manufacturers with large operations in China. This year, China edged out the United States as the European Union's largest trading partner, with 480 billion euros, or $590 billion, in two-way trade through October.The pact would loosen many of the restrictions imposed on European companies working in China, including a requirement that they operate through joint ventures with Chinese partners and share sensitive technology.The agreement would also open up China to European banks and contains provisions intended to curtail secret government subsidies. Foreign companies often complain that the Chinese government secretly subsidizes domestic firms to give them a competitive advantage.The agreement will ""significantly improve the competitive environment for European companies in China,"" Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Association of the Auto Industry, said in a statement before the announcement. ""It will provide new impetus for a global, rules-based framework for trade and investment.""China's leader, Xi Jinping, also made reaching the agreement a priority, authorizing negotiators to make enough concessions to persuade the Europeans to move ahead.European officials said a breakthrough came in mid-December when China, in a significant concession, agreed to make a stronger commitment to observe international standards on forced labor. China also agreed to step up its efforts to fight climate change.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the agreement would provide ""unprecedented access to the Chinese market for European investors, enabling our businesses to grow and created jobs.""""It will also commit China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency and nondiscrimination,"" she said in a statement.The announcement was preceded by a video call that included Mr. Xi, Ms. von der Leyen, Ms. Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron of France.Concluding the pact now is a diplomatic victory for China, which has seen its international standing battered over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, its crackdowns in Hong Kong, and the forced labor and mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang.Those issues -- and wariness of Chinese pledges truly to open up to foreign investment -- became the focus of opposition to the agreement as the final details were ironed out. For the Chinese, the deal demonstrated that the country does not face significant diplomatic isolation over its handling of human rights.But the agreement could be a tough sell in Europe.""Public opinion was very disillusioned with the Chinese regime,"" because of Hong Kong and the pandemic, said Philippe Le Corre, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School who tracks Chinese investment in Europe. ""And now we have this deal, which is mainly designed to please a handful of German multinational companies.""The opponents may be able to muster enough votes to block ratification in the European Parliament.Reinhard Bütikofer, a leader of the German Green party and chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with China, said the agreement should include a stronger guarantee against the use of forced labor.""I think the European Parliament will fight very hard for its point of view on that issue and several others,"" he told Deutschlandfunk radio Wednesday.China appeared eager to reach an agreement before Mr. Biden takes office in January, calculating that closer economic ties with the Europeans could forestall efforts by the new administration to come up with an allied strategy for challenging China's trade practices and other policies.Mr. Biden, in a speech on Monday, said that on any issue that mattered to the U.S.-China relationship, the United States was ""stronger and more effective when we are flanked by nations that share our vision for the future of the world.""Currently, he said, there is ""an enormous vacuum"" in American leadership. ""We're going to have to regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find ways to work around us or without us.""The White House also opposed the agreement, but had little leverage among the Europeans to block it. The Trump administration has tried for months to isolate China and its companies -- announcing new restrictions on those tied to the People's Liberation Army this week -- only to be repudiated by countries still willing to engage the Chinese.The Europeans' decision to overlook objections from the Biden camp was an indication that relations with the United States will not automatically snap back to the relative bonhomie that prevailed during the Obama administration.President Trump's penchant for burning bridges with longtime allies inspired Europe to largely ignore the United States as it pursued trade agreements with countries like Japan, Vietnam and Australia. European diplomats said this week that while they hoped for a more cooperative relationship with the Biden administration, they could not subordinate their interests to the U.S. election cycle.Negotiators for China and the European Union had been working on a deal for almost seven years, but progress accelerated suddenly after Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump in the election.Unlike Mr. Trump, who has often been hostile to Europe, Mr. Biden is expected to try to cooperate with the European Union to rein in Chinese ambitions, but those efforts could take many months to materialize.United States law prohibits members of the incoming administration from negotiating directly with foreign officials until Mr. Biden is sworn into office on Jan. 20. In an interview at the beginning of December, he said he planned to conduct a full review of the trading relationship with China and consult with allies in Asia and Europe to develop a coherent strategy before making changes to America's terms of trade.""I'm not going to make any immediate moves,"" he said.In the interim, Mr. Biden's advisers have used public statements to caution European officials against any hasty action, and to try to persuade them of the benefits of waiting to coordinate with the new American administration.Mr. Biden's choice as national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, wrote on Twitter this month that the new administration ""would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China's economic practices.""Chinese officials pressed to keep the deal on track in recent weeks, especially after opposition in Europe spilled into public.As the talks hit a snag last week, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the agreement would have ""great significance for the recovery of the global economy."" It said that both sides had to be willing to ""meet halfway,"" but that China would protect ""own security and development interests.""Despite the agreement's provisions on forced labor, Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that the country engages in the practice -- in Xinjiang or elsewhere -- despite evidence to the contrary. The vehemence of those denials raises questions about how China could be expected to honor commitments to protect workers' rights.""The so-called forced labor in Xinjiang is a complete lie,"" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Wang Wenbin, said recently. ""Those responsible for such despicable slandering should be condemned and held accountable.""The European Chamber of Commerce in China welcomed the agreement, though with a note of caution, saying it could still face hurdles before the two countries ratify it. ""A strong agreement would be a powerful statement to show that constructive engagement can produce results,"" the chamber's president, Jörg Wuttke, said in a statement.Ana Swanson, Keith Bradsher and Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.Ana Swanson, Keith Bradsher and Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.European leaders taking part in a summit meeting in September with Xi Jinping, China's president.

1341,1989166626.xml,"ESSEN, Germany -- The mood among the comrades was restive.Two dozen members of the local chapter of the Social Democratic Party patiently sat through the order of the day -- public toilets, the closure of a slaughterhouse -- until discussion finally turned to agenda item No. 8.
It was the question all were waiting for: Should their proud but ailing party join Chancellor Angela Merkel in another coalition government -- despite having categorically ruled it out for most of last year?
""Comrades,"" Matthias Vollstedt, the jovial bow-tie-wearing leader of the local party chapter, asked the eclectic group of workers, students, civil servants and pensioners, age 22 to 82, ""is there anyone in the room who actually wants this?""
Not a single hand went up.
Therein lies a potentially major stumbling block not only for Ms. Merkel, but for all of Europe, which has been waiting for Germany to form a government for three and a half months since its inconclusive September election.
This Sunday, 600 Social Democratic Party delegates will vote on whether to go ahead with coalition talks. A no vote could send Germans back to elections, potentially signal the political demise of Ms. Merkel, and portend months more uncertainty. Even a yes vote would be no guarantee: Any final coalition agreement will also need the approval of a majority of party members.
For the Social Democrats, the issue is not tactical, however. It is existential.
The party has lived in the shadow of Ms. Merkel's conservatives, its traditional rivals, as coalition partners for eight out of the past 12 years. Those governments have been admirably capacious, straddling the political spectrum, but they have also left increasing numbers of Germans feeling that they have been denied a true political opposition.
In that time, the Social Democrats have watched their share of support dwindle. When Ms. Merkel took office in 2005, the Social Democrats got 34 percent of the vote. By last September, that share had shrunk to 20.5 percent, their lowest since 1933.
Instead, many voters defected to the extremes on left and right: The populist Alternative for Germany broke into the Parliament for the first time, finishing third.
Throughout the campaign, the Social Democratic leader, Martin Schulz, seemed aware of the trap for his party, and vowed ""never"" to go into coalition with Ms. Merkel again.
But he has spectacularly changed his mind. Party members like those in the Essen, in Germany's old industrial heartland, not only feel betrayed. They feel their party's survival is on the line.
""It would be the end of social democracy in Germany,"" one said darkly.
""Like lemmings jumping of the cliff,"" sighed another.
""I don't trust the party leadership anymore, why should voters?"" a third added.
""We are losing people to the far right,"" warned a fourth. And as if on cue, Norbert Radtke, a retired autoworker and party member for 35 years, announced: ""If they do this, I'll quit.""
In a rebellious if symbolic vote, Social Democrats in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt have already voted against talks. The Berlin chapter swiftly followed suit.
Senior Social Democrats frantically toured the country this week, trying to sway their restive base. Leading mayors and prominent lawmakers from the party's left wing also urged the party's rank-and-file to back another coalition, promising a review of any new government two years down the line.
The biggest number of delegates -- 144 -- comes from North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state and home to old steel and mining towns like Essen, where the Social Democrats long had a solid voter base.
But that base has been crumbling.
""If we don't find our way back to a social democracy that sets itself apart then not much will be left of this party,"" said Arno Bischof, who also attended the meeting in Essen.
He is one of five delegates the city will send to Bonn on Sunday. He reckons all five will vote against coalition talks.
The last time the party went into a coalition with the conservatives in 2013, members were skeptical, too, but in the end three in four backed it. The pressure to safeguard stability in Germany and Europe weighs heavily again.
But many now see a stint in opposition as the only credible hope for the party to reinvent itself and address a much deeper identity crisis that faces the left across the western world.
""We still think in old industries,"" said Mr. Vollstedt, an infrastructure expert. ""We need to think about worker rights in the gig economy and precarious jobs, that's where we're needed.""
Having rallied behind the neoliberal policies of their center-right rivals for the past two decades, center-left parties have been obliterated from the Netherlands to Poland. But it is the example of Austria that comes up most: There, a longstanding coalition between conservatives and Social Democrats recently gave way to a coalition of the conservatives with the far right.
""This is not just about the future of our party, it's about the future of our political culture,"" said Lucien Luckau, a member of the Social Democratic youth movement in Essen.
Another grand coalition in Germany would make the AfD the biggest opposition party in Parliament. In parts of eastern Germany, it has already overtaken the Social Democrats as the second-biggest party.
""When there is a shift to the right in the country, is it really a good idea to make the far right the main opposition party?"" asked Britta Altenkamp, a lawmaker in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In Essen, the concern about working-class voters switching to the far right is not an academic one. Even Germans with Turkish roots are defecting, said Deniz Ibis, a 30-year-old security worker.
Surprised at the AfD's strong showing in his own heavily Turkish neighborhood, he had asked around. ""All of my neighbors voted for the AfD,"" he said.
Last year, a local Social Democratic city politician and member of 26 years, Guido Reil, defected to the AfD and took a lot of votes with him. An active miner like his father and grandfather before him, he comes from a family of Social Democrats.
""I'm still a social democrat,"" Mr. Reil said over a nonalcoholic beer in his local bar this week, ""only inside the AfD.""
He quit the Social Democratic Party over migration policy and a sense that the leadership had ""completely lost touch with working people.""
The migration issue is front and center for many working-class voters here.
Karlheinz Endruschat represents the Social Democrats in the struggling and ethnically mixed north of Essen, which has received disproportionate amounts of asylum seekers since 2015 compared with the wealthier south of the city.
""People care about migration, crime, worker rights and pensions,"" Mr. Endruschat said. ""But let's not fool ourselves: Migration comes first.""
""The way the people in my district talk about refugees, they say things for which you'd get thrown out of the party,"" he said. ""This is not something they read about in the paper, it's their daily experience.""
There are periodic street battles between local Lebanese clans. The police have had to cordon off the main street several times. Petty crime in the neighborhood, an old miner's settlement, has crept up, too, locals report.
Many women on Mr. Endruschat's street, his wife included, have applied for a small arms license after being harassed on the street by young migrants.
Two years ago, three local Social Democratic politicians caused a stir when they planned a protest demanding a stop on refugees sent to the north. Their slogan was: ""The north is full."" The party leadership banned them from holding the protest.
In the end they canceled because the extremist Nationalist Party of Germany was planning to join.
If another Grand Coalition happens, Mr. Reil, the AfD defector, is certain: ""The Social Democrats are finished and the AfD will become the second-biggest force in German politics.""
But he does not think the members of his former party will let it happen. Which is why the AfD is already drawing up party lists for new elections.

4046,1095450854.xml,"       ATHENS -- Venturing into the most hostile territory in Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited Athens on Tuesday, telling Greeks that she understood their suffering but urging the country to stay the course on reforms and budget cuts.  But even as Ms. Merkel said that she had come as a ""good friend and a real partner,"" not a ""taskmaster or teacher to give grades,"" the approximately 40,000 Greeks who took to the streets in protest (a rather modest number, by Greek standards) treated the visit as a provocation by the arch-nemesis in the euro crisis whose austerity medicine is obliterating the Greek middle class.  Some banners read ""Don't cry for us Mrs. Merkel"" and ""Merkel, you are not welcome here."" A small group of protesters burned a flag bearing the Nazi swastika, while a handful of protesters dressed in Nazi-style uniforms drew cheers of approval as they rode a small vehicle past a police cordon. Some 7,000 police officers, many brought to the capital from the provinces for the day, were on standby, along with rooftop snipers. ""This is pure provocation, we have to answer back,"" a nurse, Christina Amanti, 37, said about Ms. Merkel's visit. ""It's like she's visiting her protectorate. What's she going to do, pat us on the back and tell us to keep getting poorer, that it's good for us?"" Ms. Merkel came to Athens, a city on security lockdown for the visit, to offer support to the coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. It is struggling to agree on a $17 billion austerity package demanded by Greece's troika of foreign lenders -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- as a precondition for releasing a $40 billion installment of aid that the country needs to meet expenses.  Ms. Merkel's visit, the first by a major European leader since the start of the debt crisis in 2009, capped her recent efforts to show a renewed dedication to European solidarity after years of harsh words about Greece and Europe's other laggard economies. Her trip also seemed to signify the dawning realization in Berlin that as nettlesome as the current leaders of southern Europe may have been at times, Mario Monti in Italy, Mariano Rajoy in Spain and Mr. Samaras in Greece are the most amenable interlocutors she is ever going to have to work with.  The debt crisis has brought down governments in Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, but it has radically transformed the political landscape here in Greece. In two destabilizing rounds of elections in May and June that eventually yielded Mr. Samaras's coalition, the centrist parties saw their historic support plummet while a leftist opposition party surged and neo-Nazis entered Parliament.  ""It's the outcome of the June 17 elections, the perception that this is the best government you can get under the current circumstances,"" said Janis A. Emmanouilidis, a senior analyst at the European Policy Center. In recent months, Ms. Merkel -- who is also facing growing criticism within Germany over Greece, a year ahead of her own election -- has come to recognize ""the geostrategic importance, what would happen if the situation would deteriorate,"" Mr. Emmanouilidis said. That includes a host of ""potential domino effects"" related to European security, the common market and the entire project of European integration. ""Going there is the right thing to do, even if you have negative pictures from Athens,"" Mr. Emmanouilidis added. ""You need to face it head on and not pretend it's not as bad as it is."" Ms. Merkel seemed to echo that thinking in her remarks on Tuesday. ""It is in our common interest that we in Europe once again win back our credibility in Europe and show that in the euro zone we can solve our problems together,"" she said at a joint news conference with Mr. Samaras, as tens of thousands of demonstrators marched outside Parliament nearby, some scuffling with police officers who fired back tear gas. The Greek prime minister said Ms. Merkel's visit had ""broken our international isolation"" and ""turned a new page in the relations of Greece and Germany,"" adding that it also helped diminish fears that Greece might exit the euro. ""Everyone who has bet on Greece's collapse and that Europe will be badly hurt will lose this bet,"" he said.  But many Greeks are extremely skeptical about Germany's intentions.  ""There's no united Europe; there's the Europe of Germany,"" said Irene Sikiaridi-Krokou, 59, a retired airline hostess and supporter of the leftist Syriza party, as she stood outside Parliament with a Greek flag draped over her shoulders.  After three years of grinding austerity, Greece's gross domestic product has shrunk by 25 percent. Unemployment is now at 50 percent for young people and 24 percent over all, while vital services like health care have faltered following round after round of cuts. ""In three years they have destroyed a nation,"" said Maria Choussakou, 59, a former high school teacher of ancient Greek who said she had been forced into early retirement. ""We were middle class, now we're impoverished.""  At the news conference, Ms. Merkel acknowledged the ""suffering"" Greece was facing. But she encouraged the country to continue on its path of structural reforms. ""Much has been achieved, much has been demanded of the Greek people,"" she said. ""I am deeply convinced that it's going to be worthwhile.""  But many Greeks have lost faith in Europe's words. ""It's just spin, it means nothing,"" said Vassiliki Tsitsopoulos, a literature professor who attended Tuesday's demonstration. ""It's never been worse, it's just going to get worse."" ""We're just keeping up appearances,"" Ms. Tsitsopoulos added. ""Including the demonstrators. At this point, we're part of the scenery.""

2833,1465032291.xml,"       BERLIN --  After five weeks of negotiations, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives reached an agreement on Wednesday with their Social Democratic rivals on a program for a new coalition government, with concessions to the left that pleased labor leaders and almost immediately drew criticism from business interests. The 475,000 members of the Social Democratic Party must still vote on the agreement before it can take effect. The 185-page document calls for establishing a national minimum wage -- a first for the country -- as well as increased pensions for some recipients and early retirement eligibility for others. It would offer dual citizenship to Turks and other foreigners who are born and raised in Germany, and it promises a new law by next summer to revitalize plans for renewable energy. More broadly, though, it reaffirms Germany's current course in Europe, much criticized by southern Europeans as burdening them with austerity. And the plans for improving Germany's ailing infrastructure seemed likely to fall far short of the extra 7 billion euros, or $9.5 billion, a year in spending that a commission of government experts said was needed. Ms. Merkel, who has moved her Christian Democrats considerably to the center over her eight years in office, agreed to the concessions because ""she saw that she really had no alternative to the grand coalition"" with the Social Democrats, said Uwe Jun, a politics professor at the University of Trier. ""This is very much in Ms. Merkel's pragmatic style of government,"" he said, noting that the concession she made had polled well among all Germans. The parties, he added, could promote the program as a favorable one for average, hard-working citizens. Ms. Merkel, who appeared tired after long hours of negotiations in recent days, presented the program at a news conference on Wednesday alongside Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of the Social Democrats.  ""We came into the negotiations with very different positions, so it took a little while,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""But I found the talks very positive."" Despite loud criticism from his party's rank and file, Mr. Gabriel said he was confident that his members would back the agreement when the party vote concludes Dec. 14. Only then will the new cabinet ministers be named. Wolfgang Schäuble, 71, the current finance minister, is considered virtually certain to keep that job, so it is likely that a Social Democrat would run the Foreign Ministry; speculation centered on Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was the foreign minister in Ms. Merkel's first grand coalition government from 2005 to 2009. But the focus on Wednesday was more on the program, which one leading analyst, Prof. Jürgen W. Falter of the University of Mainz, noted contained many nebulous passages and vague promises. Germany's important business lobby echoed fears expressed by the government's Council of Economic Advisers this month that Ms. Merkel and her partners were moving away from the labor and welfare overhaul policies of the last Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Those policies are widely seen as a foundation for the country's success in overcoming the 2008 financial crisis and weathering the euro zone's troubles since. The council ""was right with its evaluation that this could lower German growth in the long term,"" said Jörg Krämer, the chief economist of Commerzbank, in a telephone interview. Even so, he said, ""I expect that Germany will continue to outperform the rest of the euro zone in the coming years,"" because of low interest rates and the lag in effect of any policy shifts. Establishing a minimum wage of [eur]8.50, or $11.54, an hour was a central demand of the Social Democrats, but the agreement puts off its effective date until 2015, and three years later for sectors of the economy that already have minimums set by collective labor agreement. Still, Ver.di, Germany's largest service workers union, praised the agreement for setting clear goals to improve the lives of workers. ""Millions of people will enjoy larger paychecks and better working conditions,"" said Frank Bsirske, the union's chairman. By contrast, one of the nation's most important industry groups, the Association of German Engineers, said the coalition pact ""lacks the spirit of big ambitions: too little change, too backward looking and too many blank checks."" ""What we miss above all is any impulse for more private investment"" in Germany, the association said in a statement. Ms. Merkel's conservative ally, Horst Seehofer, the premier of Bavaria, appeared satisfied that he would get his main demand, to institute a highway toll that could generate hundreds of millions of euros each year from foreign motorists and business vehicles. But analysts and even some prominent members of Ms. Merkel's bloc noted that the toll would be instituted only if it was compatible with European laws and only if German motorists incurred no additional cost. Both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Gabriel emphasized at their news conference that getting the country's ambitious energy policy right would represent what she called ""a huge chance for Germany."" Mr. Gabriel said that ""the whole world is watching this country"" and that failure could hurt Germany's competitiveness, a watchword of the coalition accord and a pet theme of Ms. Merkel's. Referring to the recent rift with the United States over its electronic eavesdropping, the program noted that a new trade deal with America was vital, but that it should embrace European standards for protecting data, consumers, the environment and the food supply.

905,1755994986.xml,"       If you go to The Guardian's website these days you can find a section that is just labeled ""Protest."" So now, with your morning coffee, you can get your news, weather, sports -- and protests. I found stories there headlined, ""Five Fresh Ideas for the Street Art Agitator in 2016,"" ""Muslim Woman Ejected From Donald Trump Rally After Silent Protest"" and, appropriately, ""We Are Living in an Age of Protest."" We sure are. This week alone Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced huge protests after her justice minister declared that Arab immigrants -- let in under Merkel's liberal refugee policy -- were largely responsible for the mass sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year's Eve and used social networks to coordinate their attacks. President Obama actually cried -- that was his unique protest -- while trying to channel his outrage, and many other people's, into fixing our nation's crazy gun laws. In my view, this age of protest is driven, in part, by the fact that the three largest forces on the planet -- globalization, Moore's law and Mother Nature -- are all in acceleration, creating an engine of disruption that is stressing strong countries and middle classes and blowing up weak ones, while superempowering individuals and transforming the nature of work, leadership and government all at once. When you get that much agitation in a world where everyone with a smartphone is now a reporter, news photographer and documentary filmmaker, it's a wonder that every newspaper doesn't have a ""Protest"" section. I asked Dov Seidman, the author of the book ""How"" and C.E.O. of LRN, which advises companies all over the world on leadership and how to build ethical cultures, for his take on this age of protest. ""People everywhere seem to be morally aroused,"" said Seidman. ""The philosopher David Hume argued that 'the moral imagination diminishes with distance.' It would follow that the opposite is also true: As distance decreases, the moral imagination increases. Now that we have no distance -- it's like we're all in a crowded theater, making everything personal -- we are experiencing the aspirations, hopes, frustrations, plights of others in direct and visceral ways."" Indeed, we're being intimately exposed to footage of outrageous police brutality, terrorism victims jumping from the windows of a Paris theater and racially biased/sexist corporate emails revealed by hackers. Who wouldn't be aroused? ""Think about this,"" said Seidman: ""A dentist from Minnesota shoots a cherished lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, and days later everyone in the world knows about it, triggering a tsunami of moral outrage on Twitter and Facebook. As a result, some people try to shut down his dental practice by posting negative reviews on Yelp and spray paint 'Lion Killer' on his Florida vacation home. Almost 400,000 people then sign a petition in one day on Change.org demanding that Delta Air Lines change their policy of transporting trophy kills. Delta does so and other airlines follow. And then hunters who contribute to Zimbabwe's tourism industry protest the protest, claiming that they were being discriminated against."" That we are becoming more morally aroused ""is generally a good thing,"" argued Seidman. Institutionalized racism in police departments, or in college fraternities, is real and had been tolerated for way too long. That it's being called out is a sign of a society's health ""and re-engagement."" But when moral arousal manifests as moral outrage, he added, ""it can either inspire or repress a serious conversation or the truth."" There is surely a connection between the explosion of political correctness on college campuses -- including Yale students demanding the resignation of an administrator whose wife defended free speech norms that might make some students uncomfortable -- and the ovations Donald Trump is getting for being crudely politically incorrect. ""If moral outrage, as justified as it may be, is followed immediately by demands for firings or resignations,"" argued Seidman, ""it can result in a vicious cycle of moral outrage being met with equal outrage, as opposed to a virtuous cycle of dialogue and the hard work of forging real understanding and enduring agreements."" Furthermore, ""when moral outrage skips over moral conversation, then the outcome is likely going to be acquiescence, not inspired solutions,"" Seidman added. It can also feed the current epidemic of inauthentic apologies, ""since apologies extracted under pressure are like telling a child, `Just say you're sorry,' to move past the issue without ever making amends."" With all of this moral arousal, it's as if ""we're living in a never-ending storm,"" he said. Alas, though, resolving moral disputes ""requires perspective, fuller context and the ability to make meaningful distinctions."" That requires leaders with the courage and empathy ""to inspire people to pause to reflect, so that instead of reacting by yelling in 140 characters they can channel all this moral outrage into deep and honest conversations."" If we can do that -- a big if -- Seidman concluded, ""we can be truly great again because we'll be back on our journey towards a more perfect union."" I invite you to follow me on Twitter.

2724,1948896760.xml,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed to limit the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter Germany each year to 200,000, a concession to her Bavarian partners as she tries to form a government after losing seats to the far right in elections last month.Ms. Merkel angered many German voters with her willingness in 2015 to let in anyone who could reach the country, which resulted in the arrival of more than a million people. Some voters responded by propelling the far-right party Alternative for Germany -- known by its German initials, AfD -- into Parliament last month, with support coming from people who had previously stayed home and from Ms. Merkel's conservative bloc, especially its Bavarian branch, the Christian Social Union.After hours of talks on Sunday that dragged into the night, Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union also agreed to provisions allowing the 200,000 limit to fluctuate depending on circumstances.Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian party, had been demanding for months that a limit be set on the number of people allowed to apply for asylum in Germany. The chancellor refused to yield to his demands, until he made the issue a condition for helping her form a new coalition.""We reached a compromise that I consider to be a very good basis to begin discussions with the Free Democrats and the Greens,"" Ms. Merkel told reporters in Berlin on Monday.""Germany needs a stable government and the prerequisite for this was a common negotiating position,"" she said.With the sticky issue of how to handle the future flow of immigrants having been resolved among her own ranks, talks on forming a new government are scheduled to begin next week with the free-market Free Democrats, which welcomed the agreement, and the environmentalist Greens, which had opposed such limits.The Christian Democratic Union emerged from the elections last month as the strongest party, with 26.8 percent support. It has traditionally governed in a parliamentary caucus with the Christian Social Democrats, which earned 6.2 percent of the vote, giving the bloc the right to form a government.But with the AfD entering the German Parliament as the third-strongest party, Ms. Merkel must negotiate with two smaller parties if she hopes to form a coalition government. The chancellor said the conservatives would speak with the potential partners individually starting Oct. 18.Although the conservatives and the Greens govern together in the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, their political platforms are often at odds and they have never formed a government together at the national level.The initial reaction from the Greens indicated that reaching an agreement on limiting the number of refugees could prove difficult.""When you throw together asylum seekers, refugee contingents, resettlement programs and family members joining refugees all in one pot, and then set a limit of 200,000, one group will be thrown under the bus,"" said Simone Peter, a co-leader of the Greens. ""I would like to see how that can go along with humanitarian immigration.""The numbers seeking refuge in Germany have fallen drastically during the last year, after Balkan countries began refusing people the right to cross illegally and after Europe reached a deal with Turkey to stem the flow. Fewer than 124,000 people applied for asylum in Germany in the first eight months of this year.As part of their agreement, the conservatives also proposed legislation to allow for immigration of workers, in consultation with industries that have jobs to fill. More than 773,000 jobs were available last month, according to figures released by Germany's labor office.Further measures would include establishing more centers to process and assess arrivals' applications. Those who are rejected would be returned to their home countries -- an effort which would be sped up.Among those destinations are Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which, until now, have been considered too dangerous for deportations. Cooperation agreements with these and other countries that serve as transit points for many of the migrants coming from the Middle East or Africa, similar to the European Union's deal with Turkey, are to be drawn up to further help limit the number of new arrivals.The proposal also foresees continuing to refuse those who have been only granted temporary asylum from bringing members of their immediate families to join them.German law allows all those recognized as refugees to bring in members of their immediate family. But a change introduced in 2016, to cope with the large numbers of people fleeing the conflict in Syria, granted those who could not prove they had suffered political persecution only temporary asylum. Although it can be renewed, the temporary protection does not include the right to invite relatives to Germany.The AfD campaigned on more restrictive refugee policies, including rescinding the right of those granted asylum to bring relatives to join them, on the grounds that so many arrivals would strain Germany's social system.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

I'm willing to be proved wrong - I've even stood in graveyards and said: ""All right, show me if it's real. Give me something."" Nothing has manifested yet. Paul Feig, the director, got a lot of flak online for doing a remake with women. Guys were saying he ruined their childhoods. What are these grown men so worked up about? Probably something that has little to do with ""Ghostbusters."" They should call their moms, work some stuff out. You play a ""crazy cat lady"" on ""Saturday Night Live,"" but you have a cat named Nino Positano, and you recently did an elegant photo shoot for GQ surrounded by cats. Are you trying to break that cliché? No. It's a cliché for a reason. But it's a cliché that's pathetic. What's not to love about a crazy cat lady? You have to be very giving to be a crazy cat lady. I hear that you used to write young-adult books. What were they about? And did they ever get published? Where did you hear that? I ghostwrote them. See, you do believe in ghosts. Did you learn anything from that experience? That I love silence. A day of silence. That was one of the happiest times. What makes you laugh? Farting. Nothing makes me laugh more than farting. It's such an insult that foul gas comes out of a hole in our butt with a sound to announce itself. It's the ultimate bad thing about being a person. You do a number of impressions of men: Justin Bieber, Robert Durst, Keith Urban and others. Do you find playing men more taxing or more liberating? More liberating. I hate the feeling of having hair on my neck. I don't know how you have your hair down right now. Your colleagues on the show say that with any impression, you are always the most stressed about making sure that it is not mean for no reason. Why? It's a source of tremendous stress. You don't want it to be toothless, because then it's not funny. But I always try to make it empathetic. Particularly with Justin Bieber. I'm very worried about him being upset. Why are you worried about that? I love him. I love them all. They're like my children. You're an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, but your impression of her sort of dovetails with the haters' assessment of Hillary: that she is pathologically ambitious and insincere. Do you fret about that? Um, yes. But it's my job to make comedy out of current events. A good impression is sort of a juxtaposition of disparate elements. For instance, Angela Merkel, to me, is a very emotional German; she may not be in real life, but that's how the writers and I conceived of the character. With Hillary, it's that she's a staunch, passionate lady, and in our culture, unfortunately, there's something funny about that. In order to nail an impression, do you have to share some of that person's DNA? What part of Hillary Clinton is part of you? Yeah, what I find so lovable about her is her conviction. And I feel like I have that. I just love how badly she wants to fix stuff. I would like to do that. I'm just not smart enough. Would a male politician be similarly mocked for his ambition? No, I don't think so. If you had a man saying the same things, that would not qualify as a comedic character. I think that says more about our culture than it does about her. When Tina Fey did Sarah Palin, she worried about having an effect on the election, pro or con. What do you worry about when you do Hillary? I unequivocally want her to win, and I don't really think I have the power to sway anything. Would you like to play Donald Trump? I would have a hard time.

4194,1011160625.xml,"      ATHENS -- Greece was plunged into political uncertainty on Sunday after voters bolstered the far left and neo-Nazi right in a wave of protest that saw the crushing defeat of the dominant political parties they blame for Greece's economic collapse.   The parliamentary elections were the first time Greece's foreign loan agreement had been put to a democratic test, and the outcome was clear: a rejection of the terms of the bailout and a fragmentation of the vote so severe that the two more established parties were scrambling to form alliances in a hung Parliament.    The elections were seen as pivotal, determining both the country's future in Europe and its prospects for economic recovery. The outcome, along with that in France, is expected to resonate far beyond Europe and possibly lead to more upheaval in the euro zone. The results were also a clear rebuke to European leaders that their strategy for Greece had failed.   With 80 percent of votes counted, the center-right New Democracy was in first place with 20 percent of the vote, or 111 seats in the 300-member Parliament, a sharp drop from the 34 percent it won in 2009. In a major shift, the Socialists, who dominated for decades and were in power when Greece asked for foreign aid in 2010, appeared to have only 14 percent of the vote, or 42 seats -- down significantly from their 44 percent share in 2009.    The results put them behind the Coalition of the Radical Left, called Syriza, which opposes the terms of Greece's agreement with its foreign lenders. It drew 16 percent of the vote, or 50 seats, dominating in all major metropolitan areas. In a sign of the depth of the social turmoil here, early results also showed the far-right Golden Dawn party, whose members perform Nazi salutes at rallies, pulled in 6.8 percent of the vote -- compared with less than 1 percent in 2009 -- enough to enter Parliament for the first time with 21 seats.    Starting Monday, the front-runners have three days to try to form a government. But with seven parties expected to enter Parliament, the prospects for stability appeared low.   ""It's a completely fragmented Parliament,"" said Loukas Tsoukalis, the president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens research institute. ""The two former big parties have suffered a defeat which is greater than most people had expected.""   He said that he expected new elections soon. ""The question is what happens in between, whether there are any realignments in the Greek political system that provide credible alternatives to protest movements,"" Mr. Tsoukalis said. ""If this doesn't happen, then Greece is in deep"" trouble, he added.    The two main parties were struggling to respond to the end of their nearly 40-year dominance of Greek politics. The Socialists' leader, Evangelos Venizelos, called for a national unity government, saying that a coalition with only the Socialists and New Democracy would not have legitimacy. Calling Sunday an ""exceptionally painful day,"" Mr. Venizelos said that the Greek parties that had said there was an alternative to the loan agreement had misled voters. ""God of Greece, help us,"" he said.   The New Democracy leader, Antonis Samaras, on Sunday appeared to reject the possibility of a coalition with the Socialists. He called instead for a ""government of national salvation"" aimed at ""modifying"" the terms of a second loan agreement Greece signed with creditors in February, while still keeping Greece in the euro zone. The clear winner in the elections, the leader of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, called for a coalition of left-wing parties.    In spite of the party leaders' declarations to the contrary, some analysts said they would not rule out the possibility that New Democracy and the Socialists could form a coalition for their political survival, though it would have little legitimacy in the wake of elections in which voters migrated to anti-austerity parties.    The success of Golden Dawn is the ultimate expression of a protest vote. The party has gained ground by campaigning on the streets of Athens, where many residents fear a sharp rise in illegal immigration and where politicians from mainstream parties resist treading for fear of attacks by angry voters.   The party's leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, pledged to ""fight the memorandum of the junta inside and outside Parliament,"" referring to Greece's debt deal with creditors.   In the Athens neighborhood of Agios Panteleimonas, where the recent increase in the number of illegal immigrants has changed the texture of the area, Sotirios Dimos, 43, a post office employee, said that although he had always supported the Socialists, on Sunday he voted for Golden Dawn. ""The Socialists were incapable of doing anything,"" he said.   The next Greek government, inheriting a deepening recession and facing the likelihood of social unrest, will have to enforce a loan agreement with its creditors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The deal stipulates slashing $15.5 billion from the state budget over the next two years and completing a crucial bank recapitalization.   Yet with Greece's gross national product having dropped 20 percent since 2009 and unemployment soaring to 21 percent, fierce opposition to the bailout terms -- tax increases and wage cuts -- has led to the implosion of the Socialist and New Democracy Parties, and the rise of parties on the right and the left that oppose the loan deal.   That anger was palpable on Sunday in Neos Kosmos, a middle-class district near central Athens. Evgenia Vogiatzi, a 45-year-old teacher and a lifelong Socialist, said that Greece was ""in a state of enslavement"" that had led her to support the Communist Party, which backs a return to the drachma, Greece's currency before the euro.   ""I've had my salary cut 30 percent, I'm paying taxes through the nose and they're talking about more cuts,"" Ms. Vogiatzi said. ""If that's what it takes to stay in Europe, I don't want Europe.""   In the upper-middle-class Psychiko neighborhood in Athens, many supporters of the Socialist Party, known here as Pasok, said they had voted for radical-left Syriza for the first time. ""I voted in anger,"" said Evangelia Grillaki, 65, a retired florist. ""We feel 1,000 percent betrayed.""    Syriza, a coalition of leftist parties founded in 2004 that included splinter groups from Greece's more hard-line Communist Party, appeared to receive the bulk of the Socialist protest vote. Led by Mr. Tsipras, 38, the party is in favor remaining in the euro zone and the European Union, unlike the Communist Party, but has opposed the loan agreement.   ""The parties that signed the memorandum without asking the Greek people are now a minority,"" Mr. Tsipras said Sunday night. ""The people's voice canceled the legitimacy of their signatures,"" he said, adding that the election results in Greece were ""a crushing defeat"" to the austerity policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.    The Far-Left Party Syriza, Led by Alexis Tsipras, Above, and, at Left, Golden Dawn, a Far-Right Party, Made Large Gains.

625,1977481560.xml,"BRUSSELS -- For the past decade or more, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has commanded the stage at European Union summit meetings. But as she strode through the red carpeted entrance at the start of this week's meeting, her usual aura was missing.Everyone understands that her era is ending. Even so, it was telling that as leaders arrived on Thursday for this meeting, France's energetic young president, Emmanuel Macron, was already there, responding to reporters. Smiling indulgently, Ms. Merkel went over to his side and said, ""Oh, he's answering all the questions.""
Germany, long Europe's steadying force, has been without a government since an inconclusive election in September, and there is anxiety in Berlin that the country will be seen as unstable. The problem of Germany is, however, paralysis. While Germany argues about a new government, Europe waits.
At this last summit meeting of the year, the issue of Britain's exit from the bloc was less pressing, since governments all agreed on Friday that negotiations can move on to the next phase. But Europe has a host of other problems, and for everything else, Germany remains central.
The paralysis in Berlin, however, with a new government not expected until March and Ms. Merkel weakened, has delayed what was meant to be the central task of the bloc -- figuring out how to reform itself institutionally to ensure that the euro is weatherproof and sustainable, to avoid new shocks from member states like Greece, Spain and Italy.
Mr. Macron has laid out an ambitious set of reforms for the eurozone and the bloc itself, pushing for more centralization, more ""Europe"" and more solidarity, both in economics and defense. The European Commission, the bloc's bureaucracy, has proposed a similarly centralizing set of changes.
This was the summit meeting where European leaders were supposed to grapple with Mr. Macron's sweeping proposals for institutional change. But Ms. Merkel cannot move without a mandate. And while she participated in a relatively acrimonious dinner discussion Thursday night over migration, defending past policy about the need for bloc solidarity in distributing refugees, she has been noticeably media-averse, canceling her normal after-dinner news briefing.
""There is a strong sense in Europe that something has to change and Germany will have to be at the center of that,"" said Jan Techau, a German political analyst. ""But whether the issue is the economy or defense, I'm not sure Germans feel that they can get it done, given Merkel's declining political capital. The problems are huge, but Germans are not sure we're up to it.""
Even more, Mr. Techau said, ""German and French ideas on European governance are very far from each other.""
With Germany's caretaker government unable to make new policy, Mr. Macron and the commission cannot get a considered response, blocking progress. So the summit meeting discussed migration, with no decisions expected before June at the earliest, and nascent moves toward more cooperation and efficiency on European defense and procurement.
In a symbolic gesture, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron gave a joint news conference at the conclusion of the meeting. She thanked him for his ""close relations with us,"" and said that French-German agreement was important for European solutions.
But Mr. Macron noted, a touch wistfully, that ""Germany, which has constraints that go with its political system, just had its elections and is in the process of forming a government."" He added, ""We need a strong and stable German government to move forward.""
He added that Ms. Merkel was busy building a coalition, ""but we can still talk to one another, and we have the aim of converging in March"" their positions on eurozone reforms, so that the bloc could agree on a ""road map"" in June.
On real substance, though, Europe waits for the Germans. The Social Democrats, who had originally refused to form a government with Ms. Merkel's conservatives, are beginning to negotiate just such a return. To enhance their profile, Social Democratic leaders have been pressing for a bigger role for Europe to stabilize the eurozone and carve out a clearer global role in the era of President Trump, when Washington has retreated from its traditional leadership of multilateral alliances, institutions and global trading systems.
Germany's acting foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, argued last week that America's leadership was now unreliable and called for a sharper definition of European interests, with a major effort to support Mr. Macron. The leader of the Social Democrats, Martin Schulz, even called for the European Union to become a ""United States of Europe,"" with countries that do not like the idea to be expelled.
Both trial balloons, which were perceived as slightly desperate, were quickly shot down, and for good reason.
The lesson of recent European elections -- in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Central Europe -- is one of increased nationalism, populism and skepticism about ""more Europe."" Mr. Macron's election, which depended on the collapse of the two main parties from infighting and scandal, seems more like an outlier than the herald of a new European commitment.
With impending European parliamentary elections and a change in European leadership in Brussels in 2019, the window for pushing through any serious change in European structures is very tight and closing -- essentially the same window for getting an agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the bloc in March 2019.
Simon Fraser, a former senior British diplomat with long experience in Brussels, sees positive energy in Mr. Macron's proposals and in his commitment to reform France's labor market.
""Macron wants to re-energize the E.U.,"" Mr. Fraser said. ""But he's being left a bit high and dry by the Germans, and what Macron proposes won't get a lot of traction with Berlin. His big risk, with only about six months left to this European Commission, is to push too hard. He has a lot of cards, but he needs to play them very carefully.""
Given the obstacles, the summit meeting concentrated instead on blessing a modest advance toward European defense, called ""Permanent Structured Cooperation,"" or Pesco. Twenty-five of the bloc's 28 countries have signed up for it, with the idea being to promote national projects that enhance interoperability, efficiency in procurement and better military research and development. National commitments will be binding, there will be European Union money to foster research and cooperation, and there will be regular, coordinated national reviews of progress.
To show that this time, NATO is on board with this new European initiative, NATO's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, made a rare appearance on Thursday at the meeting of European leaders.
Elmar Brok, a conservative German member of the European Parliament, saw great progress now that British anxiety about European defense harming NATO has evaporated.
""We've advanced in 12 months more in defense than in the last 12 years, because the British no longer stopped us,"" he said. ""This is the answer to spending more and more efficiently on defense.""
While many in Europe and in the United States want Germany to take a more ambitious leadership role consonant with its size and thriving economy, Germans themselves are much more reluctant, according to a KÓ§rber Foundation opinion poll released last week. Only 40 percent of Germans say they should take more responsibility for international affairs, the poll showed, and nearly 60 percent say the European Union is ""not on the right track.""
While the German elite talks of embracing Mr. Macron's ideas, only 12 percent of Germans regard the French-German partnership as crucial to the European Union, and 54 percent oppose Mr. Macron's proposal for a eurozone finance minister.
German mistrust of Mr. Trump is high, with 88 percent believing Germany's security is best protected in the context of Europe, but only 32 percent want to spend any more money on defense. And three times as many Germans see refugees, and not Russia, as their biggest security concern. (The telephone poll of 1,005 people has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.)
There was a lot of public optimism that 2017 would be the year ""of dodging bullets and getting Europe back on track,"" said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, an international affairs think tank based in London. ""But the last couple of months have shown that Europe may be better grounded economically, but not politically.""
""In Germany there is a fin de siècle quality around Merkel,"" he said, ""but without an obvious successor, and there is none of the usual sense of power moving smoothly from one party to another. There's deep skepticism about political parties and what they have been delivering; populism survives and the uncertainties are stretching into 2018 -- with new ones, like migration and worries over Italy.""
And then there's Brexit, Phase 2.

560,2478722011.xml,"In an interview, Doug Mills, a Times photographer in the Washington bureau, reflects on a relentless four years.Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Over the past four years, Doug Mills, a photographer in The New York Times's Washington bureau since 2002, has taken tens of thousands of shots of President Trump. With a new administration coming in, Mr. Mills reflected in an interview on his nonstop job, as well as the pressure and anxiety that come with his role. The following comments have been lightly edited.In what ways have the past four years been more challenging for you than in previous administrations?It's been the most consuming four years in memory for everyone in the White House press corps. President Trump was the most unpredictable commander in chief in my 38 years of covering the White House. He drove news cycle after news cycle each and every day, and I was there for the majority of them.Was your job easier in any way?In many ways it has been easier because there was never a shortage of photo-ops, news conferences or world stage events to photograph President Trump. The White House press photographers have never had so much access to the Oval Office and Cabinet Room meetings. Many times, we were in Oval Office events for more than 30 minutes and in Cabinet Room meetings for over 90 minutes. Photographers can take a lot of different images during that time.You've talked in the past about how President Trump was iconic. Can you elaborate?President Trump was by far the most iconic president I've photographed. President Obama was the most photogenic. Mr. Trump's hair, black jackets and red ties, along with his physical figure, makes almost any part of his body recognizable.What was your own personal interaction with him like?President Trump does know me by name and has pointed me out on a number of occasions. During a G7 summit in Canada, he told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel that I was one of the world's best photographers, but that I worked for The New York Times. While I was covering President Trump's dinner with the Queen of England at Buckingham Palace, he pointed me out to the queen and said, ""That's Doug Mills of The New York Times."" I was shocked and just looked at the queen and said, ""Your Majesty,"" and the photo-op was over.Did you develop a rapport with him, and what was that like?Like many presidents I've covered, I did develop a rapport. He would often say hello when he came back on Air Force One to talk to reporters and called me a ""genius."" Yes, my colleagues would give me a ton of grief about it.I've seen President Trump praise our senior White House reporter Peter Baker on Air Force One about one of his stories and then criticize him weeks later for another story. Mr. Trump has praised me a number of times and has also questioned photos that were published. During a meeting with the prime minister of England, President Trump said, ""Hey, Mills, I hated that photo on the front page the other day."" I truly believe he respected my work and thought I was fair and unbiased. I strive to do that each and every day. I learned to tune all the rhetoric out and focus on taking photos.How about Covid and the lack of precautions by the president? How nervous did that make you feel?I've had so many sleepless nights worrying about getting Covid. Thankfully, I haven't contracted it. I've been tested over 150 times and still worry every time I sneeze or feel achy. The president didn't wear a mask regularly, and his staff followed that lead. Most of his followers didn't wear masks either. It scared all of us traveling with him when we would attend an indoor or outdoor rally with only a handful of people wearing masks. I wear a mask all the time and many times have two of them on at once and sometimes for 12 to 14 hours a day.Out of all the shots you took, is there one in particular you're proud of?I have a number of memorable photos. Mr. Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ""the clap."" Mr. Trump with a lightning bolt. A shot of Mr. Trump walking to St. John's Church from the White House after protesters were removed from Lafayette Park.How would you summarize the past four years for you as a photographer?It's been a great four years for presidential photography -- incredibly exhausting but very rewarding. I've enjoyed every minute of it.""It's been the most consuming four years in memory,"" said Doug Mills, a Times photographer. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)",2021-01-19
2354,1018597105.xml,"      FRANKFURT -- Under growing international and financial market pressure to fix the region's bank problems, European officials took a step on Tuesday toward surrendering a cherished national prerogative by proposing to knit banking systems together more closely.   If endorsed by European leaders, the plan by the European Commission could spread the cost of bank rescues and demonstrate that governments are willing to cede power to the strong, centralized institutions that many economists say are needed to stabilize the currency union.   Pressure for bold action by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other euro zone leaders escalated Tuesday after a conference call of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations, which include Germany, Japan and the United States.   While participants said little about the conversation afterward, it is likely that European leaders were urged to move more forcefully to quell a banking crisis in Spain and to keep Greece from leaving the euro zone.   ""There's no question that markets remain skeptical that the measures taken thus far are sufficient to secure the recovery in Europe and remove the risk that the crisis will deepen,"" Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said on Monday.    The European Commission's proposal for banks aims to avoid future situations like the one in Spain, where the ills of one institution, Bankia, threaten to destroy what little credibility the government has left with financial markets.   But the plan will not do much to help the banks in Spain and Portugal that require immediate assistance. The proposals would require formal approval from European governments and the European Parliament, and one of the most important measures would not be expected to go into force until 2018.   In that sense, the move is yet another example of the bloc's inability to keep up with the fast-moving pressures created by the crisis that began in Greece and is now threatening Spain.   Doubts about Spain deepened Tuesday after the treasury minister, Cristobal Montoro, suggested that the government's borrowing costs were rising to levels that might eventually cut the country off from debt markets.   ""The risk premium says Spain doesn't have the market door open,"" Mr. Montoro told Onda Cero radio, Reuters reported. ""The risk premium says that as a state we have a problem in accessing markets, when we need to refinance our debt.""   The risk premium describes the extra interest rate that investors demand to hold Spanish debt, compared with German debt, which is considered the safest in the euro zone. Spain's 10-year bonds now yield about 6.3 percent, compared with Germany's 1.2 percent; thus, the risk premium stands at about 5.1 percentage points.    Mr. Montoro said Spain needed help from European institutions to recapitalize, though he did not give an indication of how much money was required. Spain is planning a bond auction on Thursday that could help decide whether the country must seek a full bailout package.   Endorsing the plan for a more integrated banking system would show that European leaders were willing to endow centralized institutions with powers that in the past were closely guarded by national governments.   The proposals ""form one of the cornerstones of a future banking union for Europe,"" Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for the internal market, said during an interview on Tuesday, a day ahead of the formal announcement.   The detailed proposal for steps toward a so-called banking union comes a day after Germany indicated it might provide greater support for its most indebted euro zone partners in exchange for more centralized control over government spending in Europe.   ""The world wants to know how we expect the political union to complement the currency union,"" Chancellor Merkel said Monday.   Ms. Merkel has made similar statements in the past, but they take on added weight in the current crisis. While the German economy has been impervious to the problems so far, the country conducts most of its trade with other European countries and cannot remain aloof forever, economists say.   ""They'll start to give way,"" said Richard Barwell, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. ""They realize they can't let the Spanish go and the whole euro zone crumble into pieces.""   But while European leaders have demonstrated good intentions in recent days, they still face electorates skeptical about a more powerful European government, as well as the built-in inertia that comes from having to find consensus among 17 nations that use the euro.   ""I wouldn't be expecting in the next weeks or months total capitulation"" by Germany, Mr. Barwell said.   Mr. Barnier said his proposals on banking were expected to be acceptable to Germany and to most other member states because he had reviewed the contents with ministers and diplomats over recent weeks.   The main point of his proposals, Mr. Barnier said, is to shield taxpayers from the kinds of bills they have faced after a string of bank collapses in recent years in Britain, Belgium and Ireland.   ""Prevention is far less expensive than cure in the case of banks,"" Mr. Barnier said. ""But even if there are failures in the future, taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill.""   Mr. Barnier's proposals would require countries that have not yet done so to set up so-called resolution funds, with the money possibly shared by countries. The law would also require national authorities to intervene in troubled banks by firing management or forcing sales.   The plans also require some private investors in failing banks to bear the costs previously borne by governments and ultimately taxpayers.   That measure would take effect on Jan. 1, 2018, to ease concerns in the financial community that the measures would hamper lenders' ability to raise new capital during a period in which many banks were already facing difficult business conditions.   ""We are taking away the implicit state guarantees for banks, so that is adding to the need for a transitional period,"" Mr. Barnier said. ""It's important to wait until 2018 as we wanted to avoid mixing this up with the current problems.""   Most of the other rules are supposed to go into force in 2015.   Pressure on Europe is also coming from the administration of President Obama, which is concerned about the effects of the euro zone crisis on the United States economy. American officials have pressed European ministers to act quickly and forcefully to prevent financial contagion from Spain and Greece.   Japan, too, has its concerns about Europe. Its finance minister, Jun Azumi, said in Tokyo on Tuesday that he had agreed with his Group of 7 counterparts to cooperate in addressing the European crisis. He said he had also voiced concern about the crisis's influence on the yen's volatility.   ""The Europeans gave us powerful assurances that they will move swiftly"" to address the crisis, Mr. Azumi said.   European leaders are also under pressure from the European Central Bank, which meets on Wednesday amid speculation that it could cut interest rates or take other steps to calm market fears. But Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, may hold off on any moves until he sees concrete evidence that European leaders are willing to take more political risks to fight the crisis.   Jorg Asmussen, a member of the executive board of the central bank, on Tuesday delivered what amounted to a rebuke of procrastination by European leaders.   Speaking at a conference in Latvia, Mr. Asmussen noted that the Baltic country, which ties its currency closely to the euro, responded to a crisis in 2008 by pushing through a severe austerity program quickly and coupling it with economic overhauls. Now the economy is growing again and unemployment is falling.   ""When adjustment is inevitable, it is better to take the medicine right away than to let the fever rise for months,"" Mr. Asmussen said.

1068,900332682.xml,"      ROME -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called an urgent cabinet meeting on Monday, a day after German and French leaders urged Italy to quickly pass measures to help reduce pressure on the euro, but the meeting ended with no public decisions on any new efforts to spur the country's economic growth or cut its huge public debt.   The silence appeared to be a sign that Mr. Berlusconi's weakening government remained deadlocked over major issues, despite increasing irritation from leaders of the effort to stabilize the euro. At the same time, that sense of waning European patience -- which some Italians took to be verging on derision -- set off anger within Italy.    At a summit meeting in Brussels on Sunday to address the financial crisis facing the 17 European Union members that use the euro, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France urged Mr. Berlusconi to get his cabinet to agree on new economic measures by Wednesday, when the euro zone leaders are scheduled to gather again under pressure to announce deals to stabilize Europe's fiscal infrastructure.    Mr. Berlusconi issued a testy statement on Monday before the cabinet meeting, saying Italy would not take ""lessons"" from Europe.    Italy has been meeting its ""public-debt obligations on time; we have a primary surplus stronger than our partners; we will reach a balanced budget in 2013,"" Mr. Berlusconi said in an e-mailed statement on Monday.   ""No one has anything to fear about Europe's third largest economy,"" he wrote.   On Monday night, the Italian news media reported that sources in the government were saying that at the meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr. Berlusconi would present plans to promote economic growth, sell state assets and liberalize the country's labor market.   The most controversial measure for Mr. Berlusconi's center-right coalition is a proposal to overhaul the country's pension system by raising the country's standard retirement age to 67 from 65. But the Northern League, a party in Mr. Berlusconi's coalition, opposes the move.   Marco Reguzzoni, the leader of the Northern League in the lower house, told Italian television, ""We've made alternative proposals, which we will discuss in cabinet and then in Parliament.""   Though Greece is the euro country in the greatest distress over its public debt now, Italy is also being scrutinized because of its much larger economy, low growth rate and mounting debts, and the threat that a Greece-like crisis in Italy would pose to the continent and the rest of the world. Italy's huge public debt of nearly $2.8 trillion, or about 120 percent of gross domestic product, is the second largest in Europe. The International Monetary Fund estimated last month that Italy's economy would grow by an anemic 0.6 percent in 2011.   Mr. Berlusconi pushed $75 billion worth of austerity measures through a reluctant Parliament this summer, but a promised package of growth and revenue measures has stalled in the cabinet. Those measures were also requested by the European Central Bank, which agreed to buy Italian bonds to keep Italy's borrowing costs down.   Some local commentators saw the reprimand that Italy must do more, issued by its European partners over the weekend, as evidence that Italy's international standing was suffering.   ""Italy comes off as a borderline case of the irresponsibility of national governments towards collective European interests that is no longer compatible with monetary union,"" wrote Stefano Lepri in a front-page editorial in La Stampa, a newspaper in Turin.   But Mr. Berlusconi brushed aside the criticism on Monday. ""No one in the E.U. can nominate themselves commissioner and speak in the name of elected governments,"" he said. ""No one can give lessons to E.U. partners.""   Critics of Mr. Berlusconi and his government said the open reprimand of Italy at the summit meeting on Sunday was a sign the leadership was failing when the country was especially vulnerable to market speculators.   Italians were particularly upset by an exchange of glances and what some took to be suppressed smiles between Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy at a news conference on Sunday, when they were asked whether they thought Italy could satisfy the demands being made of it.   In a front-page headline, Il Giornale, an Italian newspaper owned by Mr. Berlusconi's family, compared Mr. Sarkozy to Zinedine Zidane, the French soccer player who head-butted an Italian player during a 2006 World Cup final, an act that was denounced as unsportsmanlike.   ""We are considered the risk for Europe and the world, to the point to be derided in an unacceptable manner,"" Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of the Democratic Party, the largest opposition group, told reporters Monday evening. ""Let it be clear that Italians are not Berlusconi.""   The Italian media reported later Monday that the French and German leaders had not intended to belittle Italy, and that according to the German government, the suppressed smiles were prompted by uncertainty over who would answer the question.

1889,2280292887.xml,"One of the few concrete pledges to come out of the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, on France's Atlantic coast, was an aid package of $20 million for Brazil and its neighbors in the Amazon basin to fight fires raging through the rainforest. The sum was a trifle, given the scale of the fires and the size of the economies of the donors (the charity of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio separately pledged $5 million), but it was meant to highlight a more ambitious program of protection and reforestation in the works.More noteworthy than the token action was the fact that President Trump skipped the session at which it was taken, which happened to be devoted to climate, oceans and biodiversity. Even more noteworthy was that neither French President Emmanuel Macron, the convener of this year's summit and champion of action on the Amazon fires, nor hardly anyone else seemed to find this particularly disturbing.In fact, they seemed relieved. Other American officials were there, said Mr. Macron, and it had never been his goal to challenge Mr. Trump's climate denialism. In fact, he said he and the American president had a ""long, rich and totally positive"" discussion on the Amazon fires. Maybe they did, but by now Mr. Macron should know better than most that the Trump who likes being agreeable face to face can quickly turn mean at a distance.That, in fact, was the real theme of the Biarritz summit in the third year of the Trump presidency, as described by Peter Baker of The Times: ""Rule 1 at the G7 Meeting? Don't Get You-Know-Who Mad."" Mr. Macron cautiously avoided trying to draft a joint communiqué, perhaps recalling how Mr. Trump pulled his signature off the one reached last year in Canada in a tantrum over something Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.Mr. Macron's conciliatory efforts were not all in vain. One unexpected development was his announcement that Mr. Trump may soon have a direct meeting with Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani. Mr. Macron and other European leaders have worked hard to ease tensions between Iran and the United States and to salvage what they can of the agreement they and President Barack Obama reached with Iran in 2015 limiting Iran's nuclear potential.Still, there were plenty of hazards at this summit. One was Mr. Trump's keenness to get his pal Vladimir Putin back into the Group of 7, from which he was expelled over Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Mr. Trump blames Mr. Obama for expelling Mr. Putin, and said he ""certainly"" would explore inviting him to next year's summit meeting, which the United States is hosting, perhaps at Mr. Trump's Doral golf resort near Miami.Mr. Trump also created some unease with seesaw statements on the tariff war with China, but the assembled heads of government bent over backward not to provoke his ire.Boris Johnson, the disheveled newly installed prime minister of Britain who normally never balks at speaking his mind, provided the best example of Trump-fear. On the eve of the summit, Mr. Johnson strongly criticized those who support tariffs -- read Mr. Trump. But in Biarritz, in front of cameras alongside the president, Mr. Johnson offered only gentle criticism of Mr. Trump's belligerent trade policies, ""just to register a faint, sheeplike note of our view on the trade war.""And so it went. No tantrum, like the one Mr. Trump recently threw over Denmark's refusal to sell him Greenland.On the contrary, his tweets suggested he felt himself among kindred spirits. ""The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, 'Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?""'Unless one of the World Leaders confesses to saying this, it is probably another lie. The pity of the entire Group of 7 show was that it was part of a new normal in which the world's major liberal democracies basically accept that they are out of sync with the president of the nation that should be leading their efforts to manage the world and its resources wisely and responsibly, but isn't.There may be no consensus on just how much damage is being done by the fires raging through the Amazon basin. But when countless fires are ravaging one of the world's greatest rain forests, the threat is global. The president of the United States should be standing with Mr. Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in demanding that the world address it.Yet Mr. Trump's decision to skip the meeting on the environment was treated as normal. It was left to the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, to express the forlorn hope that the American people would demonstrate the commitment to fighting climate change that was absent from their president.There is no point in trying to change Mr. Trump's mind about joining in the fight on climate change -- ""You can't rewrite the past,"" as Mr. Macron put it. Just don't get him mad.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some  tips .

741,1750692584.xml,"       There's a new can-do nation. It's called Germany. The United States, fear-ridden, has passed the torch. Throughout the extraordinary process that has seen roughly one million refugees arrive in Germany this year, Chancellor Angela Merkel has had a consistent refrain: ""Wir schaffen das"" -- ""We can do this."" The gesture in question is the most extraordinary redemptive act by any European nation in many years. Germans on the whole have understood. They have understood that to flee Syria through Islamic State checkpoints, place your family in flimsy boats on stormy waters and trudge across Europe in search of a home is not a desperate decision. It is a reasonable decision if the alternative is to see your children blown up by a barrel bomb or your daughter raped by a jihadist. Postwar Germans are reasonable people. The United States would have had to admit about 4 million refugees this year to take in a similar proportion of its population. It has fallen more than 3.9 million short of that mark. Most of the refugees in Germany are from Syria. The United States has admitted about 1,900 refugees from Syria over the past four years. Yes, you read that right. President Obama has now pledged to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees -- a decision that had met defiance from more than two dozen Republican governors eager to conflate the words ""Muslim"" or ""Middle Eastern"" with terrorist. Whatever happened to ""the home of the brave""? Set aside the fact that the Syrian crisis cannot be disentangled from the spillover of the Iraq war, and so America's direct responsibility is engaged. Set aside the fact that Obama said in 2011 that President Bashar al-Assad must step aside, and so America's responsibility is engaged. Set aside the presidential ""red line"" not upheld in 2013. Even then, by any reasonable measure, the American response to the Syrian refugee crisis has been pitiful. For a land of immigrants peopled over centuries by families fleeing war, famine or hardship, it has been especially pitiful. Germany has stepped in. Wir schaffen das -- we can do this. The can-do spirit has made a trans-Atlantic crossing. Merkel's place in the history books was already assured. She was the woman who over a decade steered a united Germany to a self-assurance striking for a country that, even at the turn of the century, was still uncertain if it could allow itself a modicum of pride. But with her decision this year to admit Syrian and other refugees, she has become a towering European figure, certainly the equal of such postwar German giants as Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl -- perhaps even surpassing them because her Germany is its own master whereas theirs was still under degrees of American tutelage. ""She does not want to be -- she refuses to be -- the person who witnessed a serious fracture of the European Union,"" Julian Reichelt, the editor in chief of Bild Online, told me. ""She will throw money at a problem, as with Greece. She will admit an unlimited number of refugees. And she will go down in history as a great European who defended the Union no matter what."" When Merkel decided last summer to admit the refugees, she averted violence that might have spilled out of control. Critics within her own Christian Democrat party portray her as emotional. But for a leader committed to preserving the European idea, her decision was rational. Raised in East Germany, she owes her freedom to European unity. It is a personal matter. The last time Europe was awash in millions of refugees was in 1945 as the Third Reich collapsed. It is a historical matter. Germany could not turn its back. Still the decision required statesmanship -- that quaint, almost forgotten word -- and the conviction that any risk of terrorism could be managed. One million refugees change the landscape. They are in supermarkets. They are in hospitals. They are in schools. Germans have been accepting, despite the huge cost. A far-right party may benefit, but the consensus is this had to be done. As a result, over the next generation, Germany will become a stronger, more vital, more dynamic, more open country. Abdulfattah Jandali, a Syrian immigrant known as John, was the biological father of Steve Jobs. Perhaps a future Syrian-German Jobs has just entered school. Germany has shamed its European partners, including Britain. A Europe-wide program for refugees is needed. Germany can't take in another million in 2016. ""There is no real plan beyond buying time to get the rest of Europe on board,"" Reichelt said. In a grim year, Merkel has redeemed the Europe that once closed its frontiers to Jews fleeing Germany. When, at unification, Kohl spoke of a ""blooming landscape"" in the former East Germany, he was derided. But it came to pass. Germany can do this. As for can't-do America, that's another story. Fear and electoral politics constitute an explosive brew. ROGER COHEN   You can follow me on Twitter or join me on Facebook.          ",2015-12-22
3778,1716880931.xml,"       UNITED NATIONS --  President Xi Jinping of China, under pressure over the jailing of women's rights activists, promised on Sunday to ""reaffirm our commitment to gender equality and women's development,"" as Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations gently reminded world leaders to protect ""human rights defenders."" The remarks came at a conference of global leaders on the 20th anniversary of a landmark United Nations summit meeting in Beijing, where world leaders had promised to change their laws and practices to advance gender equality. China, as the host of that 1995 conference, jointly hosted Sunday's meeting, which enabled Mr. Xi, analysts said, to highlight his country's ascendancy on the world stage. Yet the gathering has also exposed tensions between China and the United States on human rights issues, with the American ambassador, Samantha Power, showcasing a campaign to draw attention to political prisoners, including those in China, in the run-up to the event. The organizer of the conference, U.N. Women, said the event was aimed at extracting specific commitments from presidents and prime ministers, and all made promises of various sorts. But President Simonetta Sommaruga of Switzerland noted that 20 years after the promises that were made in Beijing, ""women face reprisals"" in some countries for daring to demand their rights. President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya said his country would do more to fulfill its national policy to prevent domestic violence. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, admitted that combating violence against women ""requires an attitudinal shift."" His country's most famous young woman, Malala Yousafzai, was also in New York, and on Saturday night she chided world leaders for squandering their resources on arms, instead of using them for schools. ""It's not that there's lack of money in the world,"" Ms. Yousafzai, an activist for girls' education who was shot in 2012 after she defied the Taliban, said to great applause at a Central Park concert. ""We have billions and trillions of dollars. Where the money goes is to military things that are not useful to society."" President Obama did not attend the conference, though Ms. Power sat at the American table during Mr. Xi's remarks. Later, the White House released a statement detailing the Obama administration's commitment to gender equality, including laws that ensure new protections for survivors of violence against women and expanding access to women's health care, including reproductive services.  ""In too many places,"" the statement said, ""from China to Egypt, from Russia to Venezuela -- women have been swept up in repressive crackdowns on civil society, and deprived of their universal rights and fundamental freedoms."" President Obama made his sharpest remarks about women's equality in the General Assembly hall later in the day. Speaking at a session devoted to a new set of development goals, he said that broadening opportunities for women and girls was central to a country's development, and in comments that could irk some of his most vital allies, including Saudi Arabia, he took aim at cultural justifications offered for contentious issues like child marriage.  ""I do not have patience for the excuse that well, we have our own way of doing things,"" he said.  Earlier in the day, at the women's meeting, Mr. Xi also continued his efforts to court countries of the developing world, pledging to build 100 schools for girls and 100 health clinics, and offering to bring 30,000 women from developing countries to China to receive training in various skills. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also pledged to offer professional training to women from other countries. Separately, a report on Sunday from a network of American women's rights groups called on the Obama administration to advance gender equality in its domestic policies, as well as in its foreign policy priorities. Among other things, the report recommended that the administration ""take additional steps to prevent sexual violence in the military,"" push Congress to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, and push for legislation to allow female immigrants to legalize their status in this country. The report also called for the United States to demand access to reproductive health services as part of its foreign policy. The report welcomed the administration's announcement last week that it would use the term ""sexual rights,"" in an important symbolic nod to the rights of lesbian, gay and transgender people.

3850,2477406401.xml,"The riot at the U.S. Capitol and bogus claims of election fraud have led former allies of President Trump to distance themselves.BRUSSELS -- For Europe's populists, the electoral defeat of President Trump, who has been a symbol of success and a strong supporter, was bad enough. But his refusal to accept defeat and the violence that followed appears to have damaged the prospects of similarly minded leaders across the continent.""What happened in the Capitol following the defeat of Donald Trump is a bad omen for the populists,"" said Dominique Moïsi, a senior analyst at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne. ""It says two things: If you elect them, they don't leave power easily, and if you elect them, look at what they can do in calling for popular anger.""The long day of rioting, violence and death as Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol has presented a clear warning to countries such as France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland about underestimating the force of populist anger and the prevalence of conspiracy theories aimed at democratic governments.Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute in Brussels, said the unrest showed how the populist playbook was founded on ""us versus them and leads to violence.""""But it's very important to show where populism leads and how it plays with fire,"" she added. ""When you've aroused your supporters with political arguments about us versus them, they are not opponents but enemies who must be fought with all means, and it both leads to violence and makes conceding power impossible.""Just how threatening Europe's populists found the events in the United States could be seen in their reaction: One by one, they distanced themselves from the rioting or fell silent.In France, Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is expected to mount another significant challenge to President Emmanuel Macron in the 2022 election. She was firm in supporting Mr. Trump, praised his election and Brexit as precursors to populist success in France and echoed his insistence that the American election was rigged and fraudulent. But after the violence, which she said left her ""very shocked,"" Ms. Le Pen pulled back, condemning ""any violent act that aims to disrupt the democratic process.""Like Ms. Le Pen, Matteo Salvini, populist leader of the Italian anti-immigrant League party, said, ""Violence is never the solution."" In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, a prominent right-wing party leader, criticized the attack on the American legislature. With elections in his country in March, Mr. Wilders wrote on Twitter, ""The outcome of democratic elections should always be respected, whether you win or lose.""Thierry Baudet, another high-profile Dutch populist, has aligned himself with Mr. Trump and the anti-vaccination movement, and in the past has called the independence of the judiciary and a ""phony parliament"" into question.But already in difficulty over reported anti-Semitic remarks and rifts in his party, Forum for Democracy, Mr. Baudet, too, has had little to say so far.Still, Forum for Democracy and Mr. Wilders's Party for Freedom together are likely to get about 20 percent of the vote in the Dutch elections, said Rem Korteweg, an analyst at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands.Even if populist leaders seem shaken by the events in Washington and nervous about further violence at the inauguration on Jan. 20, there remains considerable anxiety among mainstream politicians about anti-elitist, anti-government political movements in Europe, especially amid the confusion and anxiety produced by the coronavirus pandemic.Janis A. Emmanouilidis, director of studies at the European Policy Center in Brussels, said that there was no uniform European populism. The various movements have different characteristics in different countries, and outside events are only one factor in their varying popularity, he noted.""Now the most pressing issue is Covid-19, but it's not at all clear how politics will play out post-pandemic,"" he said. ""But,"" he added, ""the fear of the worst helps to avoid the worst.""The ""amazing polarization of society"" and the violence in Washington ""creates a lot of deterrence in other societies,"" Mr. Emmanouilidis said. ""We see where it leads, we want to avoid it, but we are aware that we too could get to that point, that things could escalate.""If economies tank and populists gain power in France or Italy, he said, ""God forbid when Europe faces the next crisis."" That concern -- with an eye on the 2022 election -- seems to have been partly why Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been so solicitous of France and of the demands of Mr. Macron.In Poland, the government has been very pro-Trump and public television did not acknowledge his electoral defeat until Mr. Trump did himself, said Radoslaw Sikorski, a former foreign and defense minister who is now chairman of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the United States.""With Trump's defeat, there was an audible sound of disappointment from the populist right in Central Europe,"" Mr. Sikorski said. ""For them, the world will be a lonelier place.""President Andrzej Duda of Poland, who met Mr. Trump in Washington in June, has simply called the Capitol riot an internal matter. ""Poland believes in the power of American democracy,"" he added.Similarly, Prime Minister Victor Orban of Hungary, a firm supporter of Mr. Trump, declined to comment on the riot. ""We should not interfere in what is happening in America, that is America's business, we are rooting for them and we trust that they will manage to solve their own problems,"" he told state radio.Mr. Sikorski, the Polish former minister, is a political opponent of the current government in his country. Europe, he said, needed to ""wake up to the dangers of far-right violence"" and conspiracy theories. ""There's far more far-right violence than jihadi violence,"" he said. ""We can't assume this kind of craziness will go away, because they have their own facts. We need to take the gloves off -- liberal democracy must defend itself.""Enrico Letta, a former prime minister of Italy who is now dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po, said that Mr. Trump ""gave credibility to the disruptive attitudes and approaches of populist leaders in Europe, so having him out is a big problem for them."" Then came the riot, he said, ""which I think changed the map completely.""Now, like Ms. Le Pen, Italian populist leaders have felt ""obliged to cut their ties to some forms of extremism,"" Mr. Letta said. ""They have lost this ability to preserve this ambiguity about their ties to extremists on the margins,"" he added.He said that Mr. Trump's defeat and the violent responses to it were considerable blows to European populism. The coronavirus disaster alone, he added, represented ""the revenge of competence and the scientific method"" against the obscurantism and anti-elitism of populism, noting that the troubles surrounding Brexit have also been a blow.""We even start to think that Brexit has been something positive for the rest of Europe, allowing a relaunch,"" Mr. Letta said. ""Nobody followed Britain out, and now there's the collapse of Trump.""But Mr. Moïsi, the Institut Montaigne analyst, struck a darker note. Having written about the emotions of geopolitics, he sees a dangerous analogy in what happened at the Capitol, noting that it could go down as a heroic event among many of Mr. Trump's supporters.The rioting reminded him, he said, of the failed Beer Hall Putsch by Adolf Hitler and the early Nazi Party in Munich in 1923.That effort to overthrow the Bavarian government also had elements of farce and was widely ridiculed, but it became ""the foundational myth of the Nazi regime,"" Mr. Moïsi said. Hitler spent the prison term he was handed after the violence writing ""Mein Kampf.""Mr. Moïsi cited the death of Ashli Babbitt, a military veteran shot by a Capitol Police officer. ""If things go badly in America,"" he said, ""this woman could be the first martyr.""President Andrzej Duda of Poland and the French politician Marine Le Pen have said little lately.

586,1492810225.xml,"       KIEV, Ukraine --  Critical negotiations between the embattled Ukrainian government and opposition leaders were thrown into disarray on Thursday when President Viktor F. Yanukovych went on sick leave, complaining of a respiratory infection. Ukraine has been in turmoil for months, since Mr. Yanukovych shocked much of the country by refusing to sign a trade deal with Europe and instead accepted a $15 billion loan package from Moscow. But he has found himself caught between the competing demands of the protesters in the streets of Kiev and other Ukrainian cities and his allies in the Kremlin, who suspended the loan deal on Wednesday after disbursing only $3 billion. The nature and timing of the president's illness raised immediate questions about his true motive for withdrawing from the political fray when negotiations with the opposition seemed to be gaining momentum. A statement on the president's website said Mr. Yanukovych, 63, was taking time off because of ""respiratory illness accompanied by a high temperature."" It offered no indication of how long he was expected to be absent. Some opposition figures speculated darkly that the president was removing himself from the scene in preparation for declaring a state of emergency, a last-ditch measure that the protesters have been warning against for weeks, saying it could ignite an all-out civil war. ""I remember from the Soviet Union it's a bad sign -- a bad sign because always if some Soviet Union leaders have to make an unpopular decision, they go to the hospital,"" said Vitali Klitschko, the former boxing champion who leads the opposition party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform. Vitali Portnikov, an opposition journalist, suggested that rather than a virus, Mr. Yanukovych was falling prey to internal political pressures, perhaps losing power to a hard-line faction in his government, a development that could presage a coup d'état. ""I don't remember official statements of Viktor Yanukovych having a cold,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""But I remember well that on the 19th of August, 1991, the vice president of the USSR, Gennady Yanayev, announced a serious illness of Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev."" The next day, Mr. Gorbachev was arrested as part of a failed coup. Other opposition leaders took a less alarmist view. Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, a leader of the Fatherland party, who was offered the position of prime minister over the weekend but declined, said Thursday in an interview that the government seemed to have adopted a policy of dragging its feet, hoping the momentum on the streets would wane. Mr. Yatsenyuk said the opposition would not falter, and added that he planned to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry in Germany on the weekend. In Washington, State Department officials could not be reached on Thursday night to confirm that the meeting would take place.  Mr. Yanukovych's sick leave took effect before he could sign a bill repealing harsh restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly that were enacted this month. The repeal  was passed by Parliament on Tuesday with support from the pro-government Party of Regions, a significant concession to the opposition but one that means little unless the president signs it.  The rollback and other measures negotiated with the opposition this week had seemed to open the way for a possible ceding of some power by the government, potentially quieting the crisis atmosphere that has enveloped the capital for weeks. The president, though, is facing pressure from Russia to take a harder line with protesters, rather than continue negotiations. The loans were suspended, the Kremlin said, until it became clear what sort of government would emerge from the current negotiations. In Berlin, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, called in unusually blunt terms for Mr. Yanukovych and his allies to stop ""playing for time."" Germany has followed the drama in Ukraine closely, with several news media outlets and politicians hastening to Kiev. On Wednesday, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, opened a speech to Parliament with a renewed appeal to Ukrainians to stick to peaceful resolutions and demanded that the Ukrainian government not ignore the ""many people who have shown in courageous demonstrations that they are not willing to turn away from Europe."" There were signs in Kiev late on Wednesday that negotiations were not going well. The Party of Regions passed a version of an amnesty law for protesters that lacked support from opposition lawmakers. It stipulated that the amnesty would not take effect until the prosecutor general certified that protesters had vacated all occupied administrative buildings, including those in provincial capitals that were seized last week, and it set a 15-day deadline, requiring police action after that to clear the buildings. At least four demonstrators died during battles with the police last week, and evidence is mounting of kidnappings and abuse by the authorities or their surrogates. On Thursday, Dmitry Bulatov, a prominent opposition figure who had been missing since last week, turned up alive in a village outside Kiev, but photographs showed him bloodied and badly hurt.  The financial aid that Russia said it was halting had helped Ukraine avoid defaulting on its foreign debts. The Russian step was a signal of displeasure with the negotiations in Ukraine to resolve the crisis by bringing the pro-Western opposition into a coalition government to replace Prime Minister Mykola Azarov's cabinet. It was dismissed when Mr. Azarov resigned on Tuesday. Under the Constitution, if the president is incapacitated or dies, the prime minister serves as acting head of state. After Mr. Azarov resigned, Serhei Arbuzov became acting prime minister; both men are allies of Mr. Yanukovych. There was no indication on Thursday that Mr. Yanukovych intended to hand over authority to Mr. Arbuzov, even temporarily, because of the illness. Among protesters on the streets of Kiev, though hardly a crowd wishing the best for the president, no one could be found who believed that Mr. Yanukovych was truly ill.  ""Of course he is not sick,"" concluded one protester on Independence Square, who offered only his first name, Oleksandr, and his job, a bartender. ""He wants to look like he is ill and therefore cannot sign these laws. This is obvious."" Credit: ANDREW E. KRAMER; Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin, and Oksana Lyachynska from Kiev.

2391,906885858.xml,"      PARIS -- As European Union leaders prepare for yet another crisis summit meeting next week to discuss fundamental changes in economic governing, there are growing concerns that the latest potential approach -- a more aggressive intervention by the European Central Bank -- will not be enough to stabilize the markets and preserve the euro.   The assumption has been that if political leaders can convince voters in their countries that they are capable of enforcing greater discipline and centralized intervention in national budgets, as Germany demands, then the European Central Bank will have the political breathing space to move more aggressively to support the bond sales of Spain and especially Italy. The thought is that the bank can flood the market, driving down interest rates to tolerable levels, buying time for Europe to fix its debt problems and overhaul laggard economies.    But with Europe veering toward recession and with increased skepticism that discipline will solve the deep structural imbalances in the euro zone, the markets' concerns have passed from doubts about the solvency of individual countries to fears for the euro zone as a whole. Those doubts now include Germany, which cannot by itself, even if it wishes to, guarantee the credibility of Italian and Spanish debt, which totals more than $3.3 trillion.    For Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard, the biggest problem for the euro is not money so much as structure, or the lack of it. ""This is a deep constitutional and institutional problem in Europe,"" Mr. Rogoff said. ""It's not a funding problem.""    Yet, with even German interest rates rising, the markets are now worried about the sustainability of the euro zone as a whole, said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. ""The market has signaled that the risk is relative currency risk, not sovereign risk,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""So a 'big bazooka' won't work for Europe now, because of worries about the euro itself breaking up and German interest rates going up.""   The last plan that was supposed to stop the rot, agreed upon last July but not put fully into place until mid-October, was the European Financial Stability Facility, with a lending capacity of 440 billion euros, or about $587 billion. While large enough to cover, as intended, a second Greek bailout, Ireland and Portugal, it is far too small for Italy and Spain, which are now in play.    And efforts to ""leverage"" the fund upward, a crucial element of the ""big bazooka"" Mr. Johnson referred to, are falling considerably short of the $1.35 trillion target, European officials acknowledged Wednesday. That failure is in large part because, as Mr. Johnson noted, the bond spreads for even the AAA-rated euro zone countries are going up, leaving less leeway for leveraging.   Mr. Johnson is a euro hawk, predicting a breakup of the euro zone. Others say Europe has more time, especially if the European Central Bank can intervene to support Italy more forcefully, which by its charter it is not supposed to do, at least not directly.   If so, Mr. Rogoff said, ""the Europeans can stretch it out a long time, they have the money."" Nevertheless, he said, they ""need to take a big step toward economic and political union, whoever wants to be a part of it."" Germany ""is right to hold out for systemic changes,"" he said. ""The Europeans hoped to have 30 to 40 years to integrate more fully. Right now they don't have 30 to 40 weeks.""   Some say they have far less than that.   ""We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union,"" said the bloc's economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, on Wednesday.   France and Germany are concentrating their efforts on a fundamental shift in powers among the 17 European Union states that use the euro, seeking to amend the bloc's treaties to allow more centralized oversight of national fiscal and budget policies, and more centralized interference in them, too. Penalties would be assessed on those countries that violate the rules of economic discipline, which will be tightened and clarified.   Those proposals, if accepted in principle at the summit meeting on Dec. 8 and 9, will bring about a major restructuring of the European Union and the institutionalization of a two-speed Europe, French officials said, with more economic and governmental integration among euro zone countries.   President Nicolas Sarkozy of France intends to speak to his country on Thursday to explain the ideas for a treaty change, and Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to do the same in Germany on Friday.    Such changes, because they involve some further ceding of national sovereignty and powers, will require ratification by the nations involved, and very possibly by all 27 members of the European Union, which would mean referendums in a few countries. So France in particular is willing to move to a treaty just of the euro zone itself.   While treaty change can be a lengthy process, the hope is that the effort will create enough momentum for economic convergence and discipline that will provide the political cover for Germany's leaders to allow the European Central Bank to step in much more forcibly to defend Italy and Spain and try to stabilize the market.   But experts say it may already be too late for that plan to work.    New rules for discipline may help prevent future maladies, but they are a distant cure for the current disease. New disciplinary rules do little to address the structural flaws in the euro zone, where countries of very different economic levels, models and export potentials share the same currency, creating persistent trade and credit imbalances. Structural reforms inside countries, no matter how valuable in the long run, take a long time to work. And austerity alone cannot produce economic growth, which is the main cure for too much debt.   The endgame is constitutional change. But in this middle game, ""there must be enough momentum for constitutional change to provide political cover"" for the central bank ""to step in,"" Mr. Rogoff said. ""But that's only buying more time. They can't finance everything, and Germany can't declare that it's paying for an open bar for Europe.""   Nouriel Roubini, the economist who has been accurately pessimistic for the most part, argues that Italy must restructure its debt now, from about 120 percent of its gross domestic product to 90 percent or below. If not, he said, it risks a disorderly default and the collapse of the euro.    With interest rates on the 10-year bond between 7 and 8 percent and zero growth, Italy would need a primary surplus -- excluding interest payments -- of at least 5 percent of its G.D.P. to stabilize its debt, Mr. Roubini wrote in an op-ed article in The Financial Times. But interest rates are rising and growth is slowing, and the austerity demanded by Germany and the European Central Bank, he argues, will push Italy deep into recession and risk a Greek-style ""debt trap,"" in which the debt grows faster than the country's ability to pay it.   Mr. Rogoff said that ""they need to pray that Italy is solvent."" He is not sure, ""but they need to give it a chance, because if Italy blows, the whole thing would become unraveled, with big risks in all directions.""   Mr. Johnson contends that there is nothing much wrong with Italy that a vacation from the euro and a 20 percent devaluation of the currency would not solve -- the traditional, pre-euro way Italy promoted growth and kept solvent.   He said that ""there is always a feeling of foreboding and failure at the end of all exchange-rate arrangements,"" but that European economies are largely strong. If the common currency does end, he said, ""I don't think it's the end of the European project.""

4008,1841694725.xml,"       Jurgen Klinsmann, whose status as coach of the United States men's national team is under intense scrutiny, said Sunday night that he was ""very comfortable"" with his position and that he believed those calling for him to be fired were ""being disrespectful"" and ""ignoring the facts"" about his tenure as the team's leader. Speaking in a telephone interview, Klinsmann -- who had recently returned from Berlin, where he attended a state dinner last week with President Obama and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany -- said that he had exchanged text messages with Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, and that he expected to talk with Gulati in the coming days. That discussion will take place in the shadow of mounting criticism of Klinsmann's performance and after the team's two recent losses in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, including a humiliating 4-0 defeat to Costa Rica on Tuesday that has many fans calling on Gulati to fire Klinsmann. ""I'm not afraid,"" Klinsmann said. ""What you need to do is stick to the facts. Soccer is emotional, and a lot of people make conclusions without knowing anything about the inside of the team or the sport. I still believe we will get the points we need to qualify, and I am even confident we could win the group."" He added: ""The fact is, we lost two games. There is a lot of talk from people who don't understand soccer or the team."" Klinsmann, who is known for his upbeat disposition, could be overly optimistic. In countries that expect to reach the World Cup tournament, as the United States does every four years, starting the final round of qualifying with two losses generally means the coach's job is in jeopardy -- and Klinsmann acknowledged that he understands that. If Gulati decides to replace Klinsmann, it could be announced as soon as this week, according to several soccer executives familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss a personnel decision. This could be an ideal time to make a switch: The United States does not play its next World Cup qualifier until March, allowing a new coach several months to get acclimated. Bruce Arena, who coached the national team from 1998 to 2006, is the top candidate to replace Klinsmann if Gulati decides to make a change. Klinsmann conceded that he understood the criticism -- ""I am not saying I have nothing to be blamed for,"" he said -- and in many other countries, he probably would have been fired after a disappointing flameout in the 2015 Gold Cup, the regional championship tournament the United States hosted, or after his team's loss to Mexico in the Confederations Cup playoff later that year. That Gulati, who pursued Klinsmann for five years before hiring him in 2011, has stuck with him this long is indicative of how much Gulati has staked on Klinsmann, a former striker for Germany. Yet now, with calls for change from both inside and outside U.S. Soccer growing, the potential for a switch is significant. Many believe that Klinsmann's constant tinkering with lineups and formations has kept the United States team from growing tactically, and some believe that the Americans' collapse in the second half against Costa Rica last week was indicative of Klinsmann's no longer being able to motivate his players. Klinsmann directly disputed that charge Sunday, saying he did not believe any players quit against Costa Rica, even as they gave up three goals after intermission. ""There was nobody giving up at that time,"" Klinsmann said. ""That was a normal emotional situation when things go wrong. When they get the second goal there, it was like a knock in your neck. I played those games many, many times. The whole stadium goes bananas. It's totally human to put your head down for a second. And then they counter us for two more. Those games will always happen. We just couldn't stop it, but the players did not stop trying."" Judging the national team's arc in 2016 solely on those games, Klinsmann added, would be unfair. He said that this year had been ""very, very successful"" for the national team, citing the Americans' run to the semifinals of the Copa América as well as the development of younger players like Bobby Wood and John Brooks. That Brooks, a defender, had two rough performances against Mexico and Costa Rica -- particularly Costa Rica -- is, as Klinsmann said, ""part of the development process,"" and one of the reasons he argued that making a coaching change would be a mistake. ""We are coaching a team through a transitional phase,"" Klinsmann said. ""We still have to break in younger players. We still have to look for leadership for the team. There are still a lot of technical and chemistry challenges ahead that are normal in this time period. And you put the final pieces together as you go towards Russia, which I am absolutely sure we will do."" From the very beginning of his relationship with Gulati, Klinsmann said, he has stressed that patience was crucial -- a point he will probably try to make to Gulati when they speak about the team's current situation. ""I always made it clear to Sunil, if you really want to move up to the top 15 in the world, you need to have consistency in what you're doing,"" Klinsmann said. ""If you react emotionally, you will become a roller coaster."" Many would argue that Gulati and others at U.S. Soccer have given Klinsmann more than enough time. And although Klinsmann is confident, a poor result in the next qualifying game -- at home against Honduras, with a trip to Panama scheduled days later -- would make things even more tenuous. By that time, a coaching change on the fly would be especially difficult. That is why it is expected that a resolution of the coaching situation will be reached soon. Klinsmann will either receive a vote of confidence or be fired. Either way, it has been an emotional few days for the coach, who traveled to Germany from Costa Rica and said he spent ""an amazing"" two and a half hours with President Obama and other world leaders. Klinsmann presented President Obama with a German national team jersey with the No. 44 on the back, and gave Merkel a United States jersey with the No. 1 on it. Of course, even President Obama asked Klinsmann a question about the national team situation. ""He said, 'It didn't go well down there in Costa Rica, did it?""' Klinsmann recalled. ""And I said, 'Nope, Mr. President -- it didn't go well at all.""'

1789,910054102.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- Europe's worst financial crisis in generations is forging a new European Union, pushing Britain to the sidelines and creating a more integrated, fiscally disciplined core of nations under the auspices of a resurgent Germany.   Exactly 20 years to the day after European leaders signed the treaty that led to the creation of the European Union and the euro currency, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany persuaded every current member of the union except Britain to endorse a new agreement calling for tighter regional oversight of government spending. The accord, approved at a summit meeting in Brussels early on Friday, would allow the European Court of Justice to strike down a member's laws if they violate fiscal discipline.    ""It's interesting to note that 20 years later we have realized -- we have succeeded -- in creating a more stable foundation for that economic and monetary union,"" Mrs. Merkel said, adding, ""and in so doing we've advanced political union and have attended to weaknesses that were included in the system.""   The agreement was a clear victory for Mrs. Merkel, and it prompted a sharp rally in stock markets in Europe and the United States. But it is viewed as unlikely to calm fears that Europe is unwilling to muster the financial firepower to defend the sovereign debts of big member states, including Italy and Spain, that have little or no economic growth and have big debt bills coming due soon.    At the meeting, member governments agreed to raise up to $270 billion that could be used by the International Monetary Fund to aid indebted European governments, and they moved up the date that a European rescue fund would come into operation. But the sums involved fell well short of what many investors and some Obama administration officials have argued are needed to ensure the survival of the euro. Administration officials on Friday welcomed the long-term overhaul of the euro zone's rules, but argued that stronger measures were needed in the short run.    Germany has argued that the solution to the euro crisis is not a series of short-term bailouts but a long-term overhaul of the rules that govern European integration. Germany is using market turmoil as a cudgel to force more spendthrift European countries to adjust to their straitened circumstances by reducing spending and ushering in a period of austerity. But critics say such steps risk a deep recession.   The European Union emerged in its current form in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a French-German idea to bind the region in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. It is now being reinvented by a united Germany that has grown disillusioned by what it considers as debt-happy neighbors and is no longer reticent about wielding its economic and political clout.   The big loser in Brussels was Britain, which had endorsed the 1991 Maastricht Treaty on European integration but opted out of the new euro common currency to preserve its economic and monetary independence.    Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative and self-acknowledged ""euroskeptic,"" was isolated in his refusal to allow the German prescription of ""more Europe"" -- to give teeth to fiscal pledges underpinning the euro.    Mr. Cameron was perceived as having made a poor gamble in opposing the push by Mrs. Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, embittering relations and possibly damaging his standing at home. Though some other countries, including Denmark and Hungary, initially shared Britain's skepticism of the German-led agreement, only Britain ultimately rejected it.   The new disciplinary rules may help ensure that there will not be another euro crisis, but they may not be sufficient to fix the current crisis -- to assuage market unease that Europe and the European Central Bank are not doing enough now to stand behind vulnerable nations.    While some progress was made here in increasing the size of the bailout funds to help the most heavily indebted states, it is still considered inadequate. That is largely because Germany refuses to sanction the use of the European Central Bank as a lender of last resort for the countries in the euro zone.   The leaders sent an important signal to the bond markets by scrapping a pledge to make private investors absorb losses in any future bailout for a euro nation. But they made only limited progress in increasing the financial backstop to vulnerable and core nations like Italy and Spain, which are paying unsustainable interest rates on their bonds.    What worries many is the size of the euro zone debts that must be refinanced early next year. Euro zone governments have to repay more than 1.1 trillion euros, nearly $1.5 trillion, of long- and short-term debt in 2012, with about 519 billion euros, or $695 billion, of Italian, French and German debt maturing in the first half alone, according to Bloomberg News.    But the new Italian prime minister, the economist Mario Monti, was more upbeat. He pointed to an increase in the firewall and in economic responsibility and said that the idea of collective bonds was not dead, despite continuing German and French opposition.    ""Euro bonds, for which a tomb without flowers was being prepared, are not named"" but will be raised again in March, he said. ""There is more money, there is more discipline, it could be that this isn't enough, but it doesn't seem to be a failed summit.""   Mrs. Merkel said the crisis had provided important new lessons for how to restructure Europe. ""We will use the crisis as a chance for a new beginning.""   In Brussels, much of the attention was on Mr. Cameron's failure to get what he wanted or to stop other leaders from getting what they wanted.   Britain threatened to veto Germany's proposal for a full treaty applying to all 27 members of the European Union. That pushed Germany and France to create an intergovernmental agreement that accelerates the move toward European consolidation, but will leave Britain out.   British hopes to lead an alliance of the 10 union members that do not use the euro were dashed. Mr. Cameron failed to bring along allies among the Nordic or ex-Communist nations whose membership in the bloc Britain had championed and who are usually regarded as more Atlanticist and favorable to free markets.    European officials argued that Mr. Cameron had in effect fallen into a French trap, making demands that most of his colleagues felt were unrelated to the euro zone crisis at issue. France has long desired an inner European core based on the countries that use the euro and excluding the free-market British.    ""It's a turning point,"" said one senior European official. ""Britain kept thinking that enlargement of the E.U. would make it come its way but it has turned out to weaken us.""   The official spoke with some sadness. ""By being so isolated and raising these issues, but failing to deliver, Cameron is in a worse position than if he hadn't flagged them in the first place. It will strengthen the hand of British euroskeptics who will be emboldened to demand a renegotiation of British membership terms and a referendum.""   Mr. Cameron requested concessions meant to secure the position of Britain's financial services sector from the impact of European legislation and to ensure that the City of London would not lose out in rules that give an advantage to euro zone financial centers. But others, led by Mr. Sarkozy, said they would not be held hostage to the services that many blame for the crisis.    Mr. Sarkozy also said he was tired of British criticism of the handling of the crisis. ""I am sick of hearing every day David criticizing us,"" Mr. Sarkozy said, according to one official briefed on the discussions. On Friday, as the summit meeting was breaking up, Mr. Sarkozy snubbed Mr. Cameron, brushing past his outstretched hand.   British officials played down the significance of the meeting, saying that the outcome ensured that the government would have not have to seek a politically contentious ratification of a treaty at home. But one official acknowledged that the government would now have to assess the outcome and draw up a strategy.

171,917997079.xml,"      DAVOS, Switzerland -- Is the ""end of the euro"" over?   Among political and business leaders gathering here for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, the talk seems to be have shifted away from doomsday forecasts of an imminent euro collapse. Instead, the debate is now focusing on the best way for the euro zone to weather an economic downturn and whether it can emerge stronger from the ordeal.   Leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are displaying a renewed will to preserve the common currency and are appearing more united. Business leaders have made clear their desperate desire to save the euro zone. And the European Central Bank's willingness to flood the banking system with cash has won crucial time.   ""Europe is a great and magnificent project,"" Mrs. Merkel, who is not normally known for florid pro-European oratory, said Wednesday in Davos. ""We wish to further develop this great achievement.""   But in light of the many policy mistakes made by Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders in the past, there are still plenty of doubters. Economists like Kenneth S. Rogoff at Harvard University remain skeptical that the euro can survive the tension between indebted, slow-growing countries in the south and economically healthier ones in the north.   Portugal's borrowing costs have been rising again, despite E.C.B. bond market intervention intended to be supportive. And Greece remains a disaster, desperately trying to negotiate a deal with its creditors as its economy plummets.   On Thursday, David Cameron, the British prime minister, bashed the euro zone for what he said was its lack of competitiveness. He invited businesses to invest in Britain instead. ""Europe's lack of competitiveness is its Achilles' heel,"" Mr. Cameron said here.   It could just be the Alpine air, or the ""we can save the world"" vibe among forum participants. But the prevailing view seems to be that the euro crisis can be mastered and eventually turned into an opportunity for European countries to clear away obstacles to entrepreneurship and other impediments to faster growth.   ""A lot of people want to save the euro: This is the principal message from Davos this year,"" said Mario Moretti Polegato, president of Geox, the Italian shoe and apparel maker. ""In the future when we remember this crisis, we will say this is when Europe learned what it needed to do.""   Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., who will speak at Davos on Friday, is much praised here for presiding over a huge expansion of the low-cost loans available to euro zone banks. By cutting interest rates and allowing banks to borrow money at 1 percent interest for three years instead of just one year, the E.C.B. poured hundreds of billions of euros into the financial system in December and eased fears of a collapse of the banking system.   Those measures have not fixed the problem. But they have given leaders more time to address the euro zone's lack of a strong central government and its creaky economies.   ""The E.C.B. measures have really helped to create some space for thinking,"" said Erik Berglof, chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which provides financing in the former Soviet bloc and in new democracies in northern Africa.   With the exception of Mr. Cameron, the tension among European leaders seems to have cooled. During her speech Wednesday, Mrs. Merkel spent less time hectoring other leaders about the need for austerity and more time talking about growth. On Thursday, she met in Berlin with the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and praised his efforts to create a more dynamic economy.   ""I have to say, we are following this with exceptional respect,"" Mrs. Merkel said after meeting with Mr. Rajoy. ""Many of these are not easy steps, and for this reason we wish the government exceptional success with all the efforts that have been undertaken.""   ""We are bound together in Europe, but we are also bound together by the euro,"" she said. ""We want a stable, successful euro, and that can only happen when every one of us is successful.""   While it is important that E.U. leaders agree at a meeting Monday to constraints on government spending, Mrs. Merkel said, ""it is equally important that we speak about growth and job creation and that every country will bring its suggestions to the table.""   There has been speculation that, despite official denials, Germany may be willing to support an expansion of the euro zone bailout fund, to reassure markets that there is an adequate firewall in case of some unexpected shock.   Mrs. Merkel's comments are part of a marked shift in tone, reflecting in part entreaties from Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister. Mr. Monti has played a crucial role in changing the prevailing narrative about Europe, by showing more will than his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, to remove barriers to entrepreneurship.   Unlike Greece or Portugal, Italy is considered too big to fail. If markets believe that Rome can manage its debt, that will go a long way to easing fears of a collapse of the euro.   Mr. Polegato, the Geox president, said Mr. Monti had helped Italy win back credibility. ""He is not a politician -- he is a technician,"" said Mr. Polegato, who described himself as a friend of Mr. Monti. ""He is fostering trust in Italy.""   He said he was optimistic that Mr. Monti would cut regulatory overhead, like the multiple layers of approval needed to expand a building.   Still, European leaders are having big problems arriving at a solution for Greece, the country that provoked the debt crisis in the first place. Greek leaders seem paralyzed, and it has become obvious that they will need additional aid to avoid a full-scale default and economic collapse.   The European Union's top economic official, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, said Thursday that more public money would be needed for Greece, even if private bondholders agreed to take a share of losses on Greek bonds.   Mr. Rehn told Reuters that euro zone governments and E.U. institutions would need to make a contribution to reduce Greece's public debt to close to 120 percent of annual output by 2020.   Mr. Rehn said he expected Athens to reach agreement with private-sector investors in the coming days on a debt swap under which they would take ""voluntary"" write-downs on Greek bonds.   ""In fact, we're quite close to a deal between the Greek government and the private-sector community,"" Mr. Rehn said.   Melissa Eddy in Berlin and Liz Alderman in Davos contributed reporting.

159,1447091386.xml,"       ROME --  Russia denied reports in the Italian news media and elsewhere on Wednesday that Russian spy agencies distributed special USB thumb drives doctored to let them eavesdrop on delegations attending last month's Group of 20 summit meeting in St. Petersburg. ""We don't know the sources of the information,"" said Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, according to RIA Novosti, the state news agency. ""However, this is undoubtedly nothing but an attempt to shift the focus from issues that truly exist in relations between European capitals and Washington to unsubstantiated, nonexistent issues."" European leaders have been outraged by reports that the National Security Agency spied on allies in Europe, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The American spying operation has created a diplomatic crisis for the Obama administration, stirring fury in France, Spain and Germany, while intensifying criticism in Washington about the scope and methods of American espionage. On Wednesday, the focus shifted to Russia, as Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian newspaper, published allegations that the Group of 20 meeting was the scene of a major effort in Russian espionage. According to the paper, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, had a debriefing with security officials after returning from St. Petersburg. The report was swiftly picked up by news agencies and newspapers in other countries. The security team then conducted an examination of the thumb drives, which the Russians distributed as gifts to the 300 foreign delegates, who also received stuffed teddy bears, cups, diaries and cables to connect smartphones with computers, the Italian paper reported. Later, the European Council's security office sent a report to Group of 20 participants, warning that some of the USB drives, as well as the cables, appeared to have been tampered with, Corriere della Sera said. The European officials then handed the devices to German intelligence services, which conducted more tests and concluded that the sabotaged electronic equipment could be used to intercept data from computers and mobile phones. Corriere della Sera also reported that Italian secret service agents were still examining some of the devices distributed to Italy's delegation. In Brussels, a media official in Mr. Rompuy's office declined to comment on Wednesday. ""There are always measures in place to protect the infrastructure of the council and, as a rule, there is a cooperation with member states,"" said the official, Nicolas Kerleroux. ""But we won't comment on any specific matter."" Reports of possible spying also touched the Vatican on Wednesday. The next issue of the Italian newsmagazine Panorama, to be published Thursday, reports allegations that the N.S.A. gathered data on Vatican phone calls last year and may have continued the spying until the conclave that elected Pope Francis in March. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said Wednesday that he knew nothing of any spying, and he played down the report. ""We have no indication on this matter,"" he said, ""and we are not worried in the least.""  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2152,1030985221.xml,"      LONDON -- James Konrad, a bookish 27-year-old with a polite manner, used to make a living at a sports betting company, weighing the odds of muddy terrain affecting the sure-footedness of racehorses. These days, he takes bets on the muddy terrain that is European politics.   Mr. Konrad trades up to $:3 billion, or $4.7 billion, worth of euro zone bonds a day for Royal Bank of Scotland. The bets are just as uncertain in both fields, but the sums are vastly larger in his current job, amounts that seem to stagger even him. ""How do you make someone understand that you've traded a billion worth in bonds?"" Mr. Konrad said. ""A billion. It's easy to get lost in the zeros.""    The bond market has emerged as a mighty protagonist in Europe's economic crisis, representing a seminal shift in power from politicians to investors and a relatively obscure cohort of bankers. Their collective day-to-day judgment can now topple governments and hold the key to the survival of the euro.    If that market seems an unfathomable Goliath to outsiders, in interviews bond traders themselves confessed to being fearful and confused. They now juggle astonishing levels of risk and wealth for investors -- some 6.7 trillion euros, or $8.3 trillion, in euro zone government debt, according to the European Central Bank.    Fundamental economic concerns that some European countries have too much debt is a major factor driving the market. Many investors are worried about the medium and long-term risk of holding European government debt, and have made what they consider the rational decision to reduce their holdings or even bail out. And while European leaders maintain that the common euro currency will survive the crisis, not all economists are so sure.   Some traders worry openly that too many of their colleagues lack the skills to decipher conflicting signals from Europe's leaders in an industry ever more dependent on perception and political guesswork. The short-term fluctuations of bond rates, they concede, are not always an accurate reflection of value and risk. Yet traders are being taken as the last word by politicians on any range of government policies -- and are often misinterpreted, they said.    ""We used to be able to measure everything to the nth degree,"" said Tim Skeet, managing director of fixed income at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ""These days, nothing is measurable. This has become less about number-crunching and more about the oracle of Delphi.""   Economists tend to treat the bond market as a rational player imposing budget discipline on politicians. Politicians portray it as having the conscience of a mob, accusing ""bond vigilantes"" of undermining Europe's recovery and its cherished welfare state. The reality is more nuanced.    That fear among traders and their jittery investors helps explain why rates have surged for troubled countries like Italy and Spain, and why interest rates have hovered near negative territory for more trusted German bonds: so terrified are investors that they are effectively paying Berlin for the privilege of lending it money.    But in risk, there is also profit -- lots of it -- as well as loss. The amounts now at the command of the bond market have made it vulnerable to the kinds of speculation, volatility and returns more associated with the stock market. As government debt across the European Union has reached 88 percent of gross domestic product, and much higher in a number of countries, according to Eurostat, some sovereign debt funds have made investors annual returns of 9 percent. Of course, investors who held Greek government bonds suffered steep losses when that country defaulted.   With so much leverage at its disposal, the bond market's judgments can have the power of prophecy -- that is, they can be self-fulfilling, influencing events even as traders assess them from the trading floor.   If investors and traders judge Spanish bonds to be risky because Spain's government may default, they help make it more likely that Spain will indeed default, by raising its borrowing costs.   ""Whatever the Spanish government does -- and it has done a lot -- it doesn't actually help much, because the market is pretty much convinced a full-fledged bailout is required,"" said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consulting firm in London that specializes in sovereign credit risk.   It has not helped, of course, that for months the Spanish government denied or misrepresented the depths of its banking problems. Nor that before Spain ran into trouble, Greece had already defaulted on its debts. And given Spain's deep economic problems, some believe that a bailout may be needed.    If politicians expected the bond market to speak with one voice, traders commonly complained, it would help if politicians did, too. Olivier de Larouziere remembers calling a crisis meeting in the Left Bank offices of Natixis Asset Management in Paris during one watershed moment in June.   That day, Mr. de Larouziere, who as head of fixed-income euro securities at Natixis manages 18 billion euros worth of debt, watched as the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed above 7 percent while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her European counterparts scrambled to persuade markets that a bailout for Spain would not be needed.   The yield, or interest rate, on a bond rises as its price falls. Both reflect the risk of the investment. The rise in the rate meant that bonds Mr. de Larouziere had previously purchased were losing value.   When the news ticker on Mr. de Larouziere's screen announced that leaders had agreed in principle to lay the groundwork for the banking union that markets had been clamoring for, the yields eased back. But his relief did not last long.   ""After the weekend, questions began circulating on the floor,"" he recalled. ""We suddenly realized that this would only really take effect in 2013.""   Once stung, Mr. de Larouziere was left too wary to buy Spanish debt. He was not the only one. A week after the summit meeting, rates were higher than on the eve of the talks.   That kind of negative perception -- prompted at least in part by legitimate concerns that European leaders do not agree about what to do -- can be infectious, particularly when mixed with real economic data that has grown increasingly alarming. These days Mr. de Larouziere says, ""Italian bond yields should not be where they are,"" meaning he thinks the country's progress in making policy overhauls was better than it was being given credit for. But he is still selling his Italian debt, fearing that collective pessimism will make it harder for Rome to raise the 100 billion euros it needs this year.    ""This is less about economic fundamentals and more about fundamental human emotions -- it's about fear,"" he said. Of course, skeptics would counter that for all the policy progress that Italy has made, its bond prices reflect worry that its debt level remains uncomfortably high.   Those concerns are new for most traders who came of age when much of Europe carried a triple-A credit rating. The picture has changed so quickly that Mr. Konrad, though not yet 30, has straddled the two eras.   On the Royal Bank of Scotland trading floor, Mr. Konrad sits behind a wall of real-time numbers: yields, futures and a spreadsheet with color-coded bond issues flicker across seven computer screens.   But these days his history degree comes in handy. To come up with the 600-plus price quotes a day he makes for his bonds -- about one a minute -- Mr. Konrad's assessment of a country's election results is in many ways as important as its G.D.P. report.   As someone who has studied German and French literature, his colleague Mr. Skeet worries that modern markets are not prepared for this new world. ""Some people are too reliant on models without asking questions,"" he said. ""We ought to go from a highly technical, data-driven, data-sensitive approach to a more intuitive, qualitative approach.""   Mr. Konrad is the only one on his desk with a humanities degree. The other four have either mathematics or science degrees, like most traders on the floor.   While Mr. Konrad spends part of his time trying to gauge shifting political currents, his more mathematically minded colleagues model his thoughts for trading purposes. The results are not always consistent, he conceded. ""There is some irrationality to the market,"" he said.

2732,1914051732.xml,"BERLIN -- The emotional issue of same-sex marriage moved swiftly to the center of Germany's national election campaign on Tuesday after Chancellor Angela Merkel softened her resistance, saying for the first time that she would allow members of her party to vote as they saw fit on the issue.Ms. Merkel's statement came after decisions by her current coalition partners, the Social Democrats -- along with two other parties that may be part of her government after elections in September -- made their support contingent on backing for same-sex marriage.
The chancellor's conservative Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, which is strongly Roman Catholic, have favored a ""family values"" approach, but opinion polls increasingly suggest that a clear majority of German voters of all ages are in favor of same-sex marriage.
The chancellor continues to face resistance from her conservative camp -- her party's chief whip in Parliament, Michael Grosse-Brömer, said on Tuesday, ""There is no need for an overly hasty decision.""
Ms. Merkel's challenger from the Social Democrats, Martin Schulz, demanded that the chancellor allow a parliamentary vote, and that is likely to come this week; if it does, the measure is almost certain to pass.
Ms. Merkel is known as a tactical politician who is not averse to shifting her party's stance on important issues if she thinks it will gain her votes, and she appeared to be bowing to political pressure in allowing lawmakers to cast their ballot as a ""vote of conscience.""
Ms. Merkel's comments came on Monday during a relaxed interview with journalists from Brigitte, one of Germany's best-selling glossy magazines for women, when she was asked by an audience member about the growing demands to recognize same-sex marriage.
The chancellor prevaricated, reciting the familiar factors, including Christian belief, that influenced people's positions on the issue, and she lamented the over-politicization of the debate.
But, she added, ""I would like to lead the discussion more into a situation where it is a question of conscience rather than something I push through with a majority vote.""
Support for same-sex marriage in Germany is widespread. In a YouGov poll conducted in May, 66 percent of 1,099 respondents favored permitting same-sex marriage, and a narrower majority, 57 percent, favored allowing adoption by gay couples.
Germany recognized civil unions for gay and lesbian couples in 2001. Over the years, and via several court decisions, those couples have won a series of court rulings, including the ability to inherit goods and property. But they have not, so far, won the right to adopt.
Peter Ramsauer, a former cabinet minister and a legislator for the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, rejected outright the need for a vote.
""Germany has more paramount issues to address,"" Mr. Ramsauer said, warning his Christian Democratic Union partners to ""be careful not to destroy the last conservative values.""
But Stefan Kaufmann, an openly gay legislator for the Christian Democrats, said that he hoped Parliament would vote on the issue this week. ""This is a sign that my party is changing,"" Mr. Kaufmann said, estimating that about 40 percent of his Christian Democratic colleagues favored allowing same-sex marriage.
Ms. Merkel, when asked Monday evening about gay adoption, cited what she said was a recent meeting with a lesbian who invited the chancellor to visit her and her partner's home in Ms. Merkel's parliamentary constituency in northern Germany, where the couple has raised at least eight foster children.
The chancellor said she had not had time to take up the invitation, but she used it as a way to illustrate that it may often be better for children to live permanently with a loving couple no matter what their sex, rather than moving from home to home in foster care.
The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency of Germany backed Ms. Merkel's change in approach. ""This is not a controversial issue,"" Christine Lüders, the director of the agency, said. ""I think this position was long overdue, and gays and lesbians should not have to wait for several months until after the election. The vote for marriage equality can be held this week.""
Axel Hochrein, a board member of the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, attributed Ms. Merkel's shift to the pressure from other established parties.
""This shows that the political and social pressure on the government had become so big that she had to react,"" Mr. Hochrein said. ""With three possible coalition partners now declaring that the opening of marriage must be in the coalition contract, perhaps she wants to solve the problem before it appears after the election.""
Volker Beck, a well-known campaigner for gay rights and a Green Party lawmaker in Parliament, argued that Ms. Merkel had been compelled to shift after the Greens, the Social Democrats and the Liberal Democrats all said there could be no coalition without gay marriage.
""This means she has nothing to win on the issue,"" Mr. Beck said. ""Before getting trapped in this 'lose lose' situation, she has decided to step aside and say 'O.K., let's just decide in Parliament on the question of conscience, everyone is free to vote.""'

3506,1699807589.xml,"       BERLIN --  At the height of crucial negotiations over the latest bailout of Greece this month, Germany circulated a proposal that undercut decades of promises about the march toward deeper European unity: Greece, it said, could be offered a temporary exit from the euro. The proposal reflected some muscle-flexing by hard-liners in Berlin. But it was first broached privately not by the Germans, but by Slovenia, a tiny eurozone member whose finance minister demanded a ""Plan B"" for a leftist Greek government he compared to the former Yugoslavia's Communists. Slovenia's proposal was a double triumph for Germany. Greece's economic crisis not only has done nothing to soften Germany's insistence on adherence to rules, fiscal austerity and dire consequences for countries that fail to live up to their obligations, but it has also actually reinforced the willingness of Germany's allies in Europe to impose even harsher conditions on Athens. From Lisbon to Latvia, from creditor countries to debtors, among some left-wing leaders as well as conservative governments, the response to Greece reflected a deep aversion to government spending as a tool to fight economic slumps and faith in deregulated labor markets. It is a vision of austere, market-based policies that are a break with Europe's past. Germany persuaded European leaders to rally more firmly around what might be called the Berlin consensus by a combination of patient diplomacy and clever brinkmanship and by exploiting alarm over the antics of Greece's leaders, numerous participants in the crisis talks recounted in interviews. It was a victory, many of those participants acknowledge, that reflected the politics of today's Europe rather than a viable plan to help Greece's economy in the short run. Despite forecasts that recovery would follow the bitter medicine Germany and lenders like the International Monetary Fund have been prescribing for Greece for five years, the country is stuck in a depression-like slump. The latest package tightens austerity rather than relieving it. In the view of many economists, particularly in the United States and Britain, the continued imposition of a budget-cutting-first approach during an extended downturn is holding back recovery not just in Greece but also across the Continent, which continues to suffer from towering unemployment and tepid growth years after the United States began recovering from the financial crisis that started in 2008. The eurozone unemployment rate is above 11 percent, more than double that of the United States. Its economic output in 2014 was lower than in 2007, before the global crisis. Youth unemployment is particularly high, raising the possibility of long-lasting damage to the Continent's economic potential as young people are idle at a time when they would normally be developing key skills. Nationalist and populist political movements on both the left and the right, drawing strength from economic dislocation, are undermining support for European unity. ""The belief that the euro can be used to bring about the economic 're-education' of Europe's south will prove a dangerous fallacy -- and not just in Greece,"" Joschka Fischer, a left-leaning former German foreign minister, wrote this week. The rising influence of the Berlin consensus despite these trends has much to do with the political backlash in Europe to the Greek government under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his radical-left Syriza party. Mr. Tsipras's heated arguments against austerity, however much they reflected the views of many economists, were undermined at least in part by his government's inconsistent policies and frontal challenges to German leadership. But previous efforts by the current governments of France and Italy to encourage more flexibility in imposing austerity have also made little headway. Like Greece, they have run up against a combination of subtle German diplomacy by its seasoned center-right leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble; German credibility and power derived from a strong domestic economy; and, perhaps most important, domestic political considerations in countries across Europe that are encouraging their leaders to express greater devotion to the German way of doing things. That philosophy, as applied since the financial crisis began upending global economies in 2008, transcends typical lines of right versus left (one of the chief engineers of the latest Greek bailout, which demands new austerity and major reforms, was the Dutch finance minister, who is from his country's Labour Party). And it is not simply a matter of creditor versus debtor (Portugal, among other debtor countries that signed on, insisted Greece make the same difficult reforms it has). In the end, in a crucial debate that set up Europe's position against Greece in negotiations the week of July 12, 15 nations embraced the hard-line position with only three, France, Italy and Cyprus, isolated as preferring a more generous approach open to debt forgiveness. ""Yes, certainly Germany has been in the driver's seat through this process, there's no denying it,"" said Alexander Stubb, the Finnish finance minister and one of Berlin's hard-line allies. ""Part of it is personalities. Part of it is Germany's economic track record. But it's also that they know their stuff. They go into negotiations well prepared and with a determination to stick to the rules we've agreed on."" Germany has long been known as Europe's ""reluctant hegemon,"" for its reluctance to be too assertive in diplomacy given its history of militarism. But the unique circumstances of the Greek crisis, especially since the start of this year, have helped make it a country that is both a little less reluctant and a little more of a hegemon. Merkel's Deft Touch There is a common thread in Ms. Merkel's uniquely influential role guiding the politics of Europe throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath. At the same time that she has been the leading voice for the principle that countries must follow the rules and pay the consequences if they do not, she has also embodied the strong German instinct to keep knitting Europe closer together. To do so, she has applied a deft diplomatic touch. The German government maintains a fleet of Airbus planes marked ""Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" for its high officials, and Ms. Merkel has made full use of them in her decade at the head of Western Europe's largest economy. She had visited what were then all 27 nations of the European Union by the end of her first four-year term in office. She will often visit a country and return home the same day, much the way an American president makes the rounds to various states. She also cultivates foreign leaders at home, hosting them in Berlin with grand welcome ceremonies with military honors. Within meetings of the European Council, she is almost uncannily immersed in the details of whatever is under discussion, crossing out lines and replacing words with a focus that might be expected of a former engineer. Meanwhile, Mr. Schäuble, Ms. Merkel's finance minister, is a hard-nosed politician who was paralyzed from the chest down by an assassination attempt in 1990, and he is more popular in Germany (70 percent approval in a recent ARD-DeutschlandTrend poll) even than Ms. Merkel (67 percent). Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schäuble both bring long experience to the negotiating table that few can match. Mr. Schäuble has been in the German Parliament since 1972, two years before Mr. Tsipras was born. When Mr. Schäuble circulated the proposal raising the prospect of a temporary Greek exit from the euro, he was able to do so knowing he had support from a number of other countries, like Slovenia, which first put forward the idea in April during a closed-door meeting in Latvia. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schäuble regularly mix forceful advocacy of German positions with a willingness to pull back in the interest of maintaining unity, above all with the other great power of the eurozone, France (Ms. Merkel and President François Hollande of France speak on the phone almost daily). Mr. Hollande played the role of intermediary between Greece and its European creditors during the July negotiations. After Germany broached the notion of Greece's temporarily leaving the eurozone, Ms. Merkel set aside the idea after objections from France and Italy. And while Mr. Schäuble -- known as tough and competitive -- has a reputation as a hard-liner, he, too, knows the diplomatic art of using deference. In meetings of the European finance ministers, Mr. Schäuble rarely speaks first, generally leaving that role to a smaller country, before coming in with his own comments on the subject at issue later. ""Mr. Schäuble has his vision, his point of view, that he puts on the table,"" said Johan Van Overtveldt, the Belgian finance minister. ""But he never says, 'Take this or leave it.' He has been very democratic. I can't remember one point in time where there was a diktat."" Indeed, while from an American or British vantage point the Germans often seem like the heavies in negotiations over the Greeks, they have actually been restrained by the standards of German voters and some Eastern European countries. ""Mrs. Merkel has behaved in an incredibly modest way,"" said Marcel Fratscher, president of the D.I.W. Berlin think tank. ""You couldn't find her saying a bad word about Greece or anything populist, and even though German public opinion was very strongly in favor of a Grexit and no bailout deal,"" he said, using shorthand for a Greek exit from the eurozone, ""they secured a deal with no Grexit."" The Greek government often took a rather different approach. Conflicting Greek Signals When Mr. Tsipras's Syriza party won the Greek elections in January, it was determined to change the entire playing field for European economic policy. But rather than rallying the opponents of austerity to their cause, the Greeks sent so many conflicting signals that even potentially sympathetic governments became exasperated, never more so than when Mr. Tsipras abruptly decided in late June to subject European demands for a new bailout package to a national referendum. A dynamic that might otherwise have been debtor countries versus creditor countries or North versus South instead became Everybody versus Greece. The Greek economy had been devastated by a series of spending cuts and tax increases demanded since 2010 by the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank (or ""the institutions,"" as Mr. Tsipras's government asked that they be called to avoid the negative connotations that had built in Greece around the term ""troika""). When elected, Mr. Tsipras pledged to force Europe to focus on spending money to encourage growth, writing down unmanageable debts, and helping Greece and other troubled economies like Italy and Ireland get back on their feet. He tried to rally support among Europe's left-wing parties in hopes of generating a mass democratic uprising. ""The issue of Greece does not only concern Greece,"" Mr. Tsipras wrote in the French newspaper Le Monde in May. ""Rather, it is the very epicenter of conflict between two diametrically opposing strategies concerning the future of European unification."" But while Mr. Tsipras attracted allies like Podemos, a similarly inclined left-wing party in Spain, the mainstream governing parties of Europe viewed Syriza's ideology as more of a threat than a way forward. They feared that making major concessions to Greece would only strengthen their own domestic opponents when many European electorates were flirting with anti-European populist movements. ""Calling the referendum was the moment when 95 percent of the creditor countries said: 'That's it. I don't want to be blackmailed by Greece, and don't want to live in a union with a country that blackmails me,' "" said Guntram Wolff, the director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. At a crucial moment in late June, the finance ministers met and excluded Yanis Varoufakis, then Greece's finance minister, from the room, a symbol of how isolated the country had become. After the decision, the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, said in the closed-door meeting, ""I guess we can go back to calling it the troika."" Complex Incentives Mr. Tsipras was not the first European leader to try to push the Continent's politics away from austerity. Mr. Hollande did the same after his election in France in 2012, as did Matteo Renzi when he became Italian prime minister last year. But they have had little more success than the Greeks in altering policy or even shifting the terms of the debate. Mr. Hollande, for example, has advocated, so far unsuccessfully, ""Eurobonds"" in which European countries borrow money collectively that could be used to fund infrastructure projects or other growth-spurring investments without exposing any individual country to the risk of excessive debt. Part of the reason is the rise of domestic political constraints on anything that could put taxpayers in one country at risk for economic mismanagement in another. Just as the unpopular United States bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009 helped usher the Tea Party's small government philosophy into prominence in American politics, the use of billions of euros in European taxpayers' money to aid Greece has been a boon for the populist right. In Slovakia, a coalition government fell because of its support for a previous Greek bailout. In Finland, a right-wing populist party now known as the Finns is part of the governing coalition and opposes concessions to Greece. In particular, the nations allied against the Tsipras government fear that writing down Greek debts further would only encourage other countries with high debt burdens -- particularly Italy, with debt of 132 percent of its gross domestic product. The leaders of the debtor countries themselves, meanwhile -- especially Ireland, Portugal and Spain -- have complex incentives of their own. Those economies have suffered from years of misery amid the imposition of fiscal austerity, including a Spanish unemployment rate that has been above 20 percent for five consecutive years. There are modest flickers of hope; the Spanish economy grew 1.4 percent in 2014, for example, after contracting for the three previous years. So leaders of Spain and the other debtor countries can point to that progress as evidence that they were right all along to acquiesce to painful cuts and reforms. ""We must appreciate the difference between serious policies and unserious policies that lead to situations such as those in Greece, where people can't access their own money,"" said Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain in a recent news conference. For now, the core of Europe remains 19 countries with very different economies, their own budgets, and yet a single currency. That means when some countries are persistent debtors and others persistent creditors, it becomes hard -- as the last five years has shown -- to fix the imbalance. ""Debtors and creditors in the end never have a good relationship,"" said Hans-Werner Sinn, a leading German economist. ""It is like between friends. If you have a friend you don't give him a loan, you give him a gift. You make a gift and don't expect to get it back. But when you become his creditor he stops being your friend.""

1559,433980507.xml,"      The German government approved a stimulus package of 23 billion euros ($29 billion)  on Wednesday in a bid to unlock more than twice that amount in investments and help the country, one of the world's biggest exporters, weather a global slowdown.   The package, which amounts to about 2 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, includes tax breaks on purchases of cars, loans to small and medium-size businesses and money for roads.    But some economists warned that the measures could prove too modest. While big enough to risk pushing back the government's goal to balance the budget in 2011, the spending may still be too small to significantly dent the effect of falling demand at home and abroad.   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany appeared to dismiss such concerns by defending the package as bold and calling it a bridge to 2010, when growth is expected to pick up again.   ""We will have difficulties in 2009,"" Mrs. Merkel said Wednesday. ""We want to do something to counter this with investment incentives.""   The economy minister, Michael Glos, said the program had deliberate targets.   ""It's a tailored economic growth package, not a classic stimulus program,"" he said.  ""We want to strengthen the power of the economy to resist the impact of the crisis.""   The plan, which requires parliamentary approval, will be financed over four years, with 10.5 billion euros coming out of the federal budget and the rest from state authorities, the finance ministry said.   Consumers can look forward to a one-year tax holiday for new cars and subsidies for certain household repairs, especially those enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings. Companies will receive assistance from measures aimed at easing access to credit and from government plans to bring forward infrastructure investments.   Less than three weeks ago, Berlin rushed through an emergency bailout package of 480 billion euros for German banks. The country is likely to push back efforts to balance the federal budget to the end of the next legislative period in 2013,  the finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, said.   On Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to make its second interest rate cut in a month, this time by at least half a point. As the odds of a drawn-out global recession increase, however, monetary policy is not the only lever economists are lobbying for. Governments, they say, should lower taxes and increase spending to make up for weak private demand.   With the German economy stalling and business confidence at a five-year low, several politicians had called for a more sweeping package.   On Monday, the European Commission predicted that German growth would stagnate in 2009, an election year, as demand for exports is drying up across the globe. A week earlier, the government cut its growth forecast for next year to 0.2 percent, from 1.2 percent, the slowest pace since the 2003 recession.   But Mrs. Merkel's government has been reluctant to splurge. The latest measures amount to about half of what finance ministry officials privately say would be the minimum for an effective stimulus package.

3135,434142192.xml,"      Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives suffered heavy losses in two state legislative elections in Germany on Sunday, but managed to hold on to power comfortably in a third state, according to preliminary results.    The results, coming only four weeks before a parliamentary election that will determine whether Mrs. Merkel remains as chancellor, could hurt her chances of ending her coalition with the Social Democrats and forming a center-right government then.   Still, Mrs. Merkel's party, the Christian Democrats, continues to hold a large lead in national polls over its main rivals, and most Germans expect her to win a second term handily.   Preliminary results of the voting on Sunday, reported by the public television networks ARD and ZDF, showed that the chancellor's party had lost its absolute majorities in the states of Thuringia and Saarland, and might even lose power in these states to a coalition of leftist parties and the Greens.   The results were more positive for the Christian Democrats in Saxony, where the party was expected to establish a new coalition government with a pro-business party, the preliminary results indicated.   The Christian Democrats had controlled the legislatures in all three states. The results in Saarland and Thuringia, which were expected, showed the growing influence of smaller parties and the populist Left Party at the expense of the big parties.   The two major parties, the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, have dominated German politics since 1945, and until recently they were able to win enough votes to establish governments themselves or to form coalitions with their preferred political partners.   But the state elections cast some doubt on whether the Christian Democrats will be strong enough in the parliamentary voting on Sept. 27 to establish a government with the pro-business Free Democrats, the chancellor's preferred partners -- or whether Mrs. Merkel will be forced to share power once again with the Social Democrats, as she has done since 2005.   The Social Democrats, led by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who will run against Mrs. Merkel next month for the chancellorship, failed to make the impact they had hoped for, according to the preliminary results.   The big winners in the state elections were the Free Democrats and the Left Party, with the Free Democrats' share of the vote in all three states increasing by an average of 4 percentage points.   The share of the far-right National Democratic Party, which won more than 9 percent of the vote in Saxony in 2004, fell to about 5.5 percent, just enough for it to remain in the state legislature, according to the preliminary results.   The Free Democratic Party is the only party to say what it would do if it became part of the next national government: it has pledged to cut taxes and the bureaucracy.   The Left Party is made up of disgruntled western German trade unionists who broke away from the Social Democrats in 2005 and then merged with former Communists from eastern Germany. The party won 21 percent of the vote in Saarland, compared with 2.3 percent in 2004.   The outcome represented a major victory for Oskar Lafontaine, the Left Party's leader, who will now try to persuade the Social Democrats and the Greens to establish the next government in Saarland. If they do so, it will be the first time that a former Communist party has entered a regional government in western Germany since World War II.      ",2009-08-31
1988,1860012998.xml,"       BERLIN -- Volkswagen's former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, yielded no ground on Thursday during a polite grilling by German lawmakers over the carmaker's diesel-emissions deception, but he astonished them by insisting that he had not heard the term ""defeat device"" before September 2015, when the scandal broke. Appearing in public for the first time since he resigned over the case, Mr. Winterkorn, who worked at the company for more than 35 years, contended, as he has all along, that he had not been aware of any wrongdoing. But his assertions are increasingly difficult to defend after Volkswagen pleaded guilty in the United States last week to criminal charges that included conspiracy to defraud the government, violations of the Clean Air Act and obstruction of justice. The company is paying $20 billion to resolve civil and criminal charges related to the scandal. Mr. Winterkorn, who has not been charged, was chief executive throughout the decade when, as Volkswagen now admits, employees devised software, known as a ""defeat device,"" that could hide excess pollutants during testing by regulators. The employees, including several high-ranking managers, covered up the wrongdoing for years. But in his comments on Thursday, Mr. Winterkorn reiterated that he had not known of the efforts to evade emissions rules. ""How striving for perfection could end this way"" mystified and preoccupied him, Mr. Winterkorn told a parliamentary committee charged with investigating the scandal and with determining if the German government had been aware of it before the news broke. ""The unthinkable has happened and we must all deal with it."" It was doubly difficult to imagine, Mr. Winterkorn said, because he had been in daily contact with employees and ""never did I have the impression that anyone was afraid to speak an open word with me."" Whether Mr. Winterkorn knew of the emissions cheating and cover-up is a crucial question for Volkswagen, even though he no longer leads the company. Any culpability on his part would make the company more vulnerable to lawsuits by shareholders, who accuse the leadership of failing to properly disclose the risks it was taking. The lawsuits seek billions of dollars in damages. Volkswagen's plea agreement with the Justice Department in Washington last week left no doubt that the fraud was the work of dozens, if not hundreds, of employees, rather than the result of a handful of rogue engineers as the company had first claimed. The settlement calls for the carmaker to pay $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties to the American government. The company did not say in the plea agreement that a member of the management board had known of the emissions cheating and cover up. But several people indicted by American authorities last week had reported directly to Mr. Winterkorn, raising questions of what he had known. Those indicted last week are among company employees suspected of a far-reaching cover-up that included feeding reams of false data to federal and state regulators, who in 2014 began asking questions about emissions by diesel cars made by Volkswagen. When it became clear in mid-2015 that accusations of fraud would soon be made public, a company lawyer prompted at least 40 employees to destroy potentially incriminating documents, according to the plea agreement. In 90 minutes of questioning on Thursday, Mr. Winterkorn provided details on a variety of issues related to Volkswagen's business, but he was vague when asked about the emissions scandal and whom he had informed about it. In part, he was doing the German equivalent of invoking the Fifth Amendment in the United States, citing an investigation by state prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city close to the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The authorities in Braunschweig are considering pursuing a case against Mr. Winterkorn. But the former chief executive also repeatedly replied, ""I am not aware,"" or ""I don't know,"" when asked about conversations with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Ferdinand Piëch, the chairman of Volkswagen's supervisory board until late April 2015. Mr. Winterkorn said that he had informed Mr. Piëch in March 2015 about a recall in the United States of up to 500,000 vehicles, a move consistent with his reputation for staying close to the chairman of the supervisory board. He added, however, that he had not known the exact reason for the recall, and that he therefore could not have relayed it to Mr. Piëch. Members of the parliamentary committee voiced surprise and disappointment over Mr. Winterkorn's testimony. ""He missed a really good chance to shed more light,"" said Ulrich Lange, a Christian Social Union lawmaker. Herbert Behrens, the chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the issue, described being incredulous when Mr. Winterkorn said he had not heard of the term ""defeat device"" before the scandal broke. There is some reason to doubt Mr. Winterkorn's assertion. Mr. Gottweis, a Volkswagen executive who specialized in solving technical emergencies around the world, warned in a memo in May 2014 that American regulators were likely to investigate ""whether Volkswagen implemented a test detection system in the engine control unit software (so-called defeat device)."" The memo was included in a stack of weekend reading given to Mr. Winterkorn at the time, but Volkswagen has said it was not clear if Mr. Winterkorn had read it. Mr. Gottweis reported directly to Mr. Winterkorn, however, and it is deemed unlikely that a warning from an executive known internally as ""the fireman"" would have been ignored.

897,876982417.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- After days of pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to reach a second bailout deal for Greece, European leaders decided Friday to hold a summit meeting next week to break the deadlock, giving them several more days to surmount continuing divisions on a rescue plan.    Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, announced that the meeting would be held Thursday, six days later than originally expected -- a reflection of the problems involved in reaching a deal.    Negotiations on the bailout have proved to be highly complex. Some diplomats have predicted that a plan that forces private investors to share the burden, as demanded by Germany, could prove more costly to taxpayers than a plan that does not.    During the 18-month Greek debt crisis, Germany has consistently played for time when faced with crucial decisions. With bailouts for Greece and other euro zone nations unpopular with the German public, Mrs. Merkel has appeared able to act only when confronted by a looming crisis.    This time she resisted a call from Mr. Van Rompuy for any meeting before sufficient groundwork had been laid to achieve a result, arguing that moving prematurely would further destabilize the financial markets.    Initially penciled in for Friday, the meeting was put off until Monday or Tuesday. But in an announcement made Friday on Twitter, Mr. Van Rompuy said he had decided to call a meeting of euro area leaders for noon on Thursday.    ""Our agenda will be the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and the future financing of the Greek program,"" he said. ""I have asked the preparatory work to be brought forward inter alia by the finance ministries.""    Officials will be asked in the meantime to address the central outstanding issue: the extent to which private investors will be asked to share the cost of the rescue.    The European Central Bank has consistently opposed any plan that would be considered a selective default by the credit rating agencies, worrying that such an outcome would increase the risk of the debt crisis spreading from Europe's periphery to its softer core countries, notably Spain and Italy.    Germany and the Netherlands, however, have insisted that the banks and other financial institutions must bear part of the pain to win public support.    According to officials briefed on the discussions, the conflict has created a variety of problems, not least being the possibility that if European banks sustained significant losses on their holdings of Greek bonds, they might need to be bailed out by taxpayers.    ""The consequence of this is more money,"" said one European Union diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly.    Nevertheless, the uneasy compromise that is emerging will probably require private investors to take losses, said one official briefed on the discussions.    Germany had demanded that condition in exchange for its agreement that debtor countries be allowed to lighten their burdens by reducing their interest rates, lengthening the maturities of their loans and allowing the European bailout fund to finance the buyback of bonds on the secondary market.    Those measures are now seen as an important way of allowing Greece, Ireland and Portugal to escape from recession and return to growth.

2587,433948413.xml,"      The German cabinet approved conditions on Monday for banks that make use of its rescue package of 500 billion euros, but loosened a strict pay cap of 500,000 euros (about $667,000) a year for top managers amid concerns that it would scare off banks that needed help.    One troubled regional bank, BayernLB, said it was considering asking for help, but the big commercial banks -- where chief executives make millions a year -- are still reluctant, despite pressure to raise fresh capital.    Angela Merkel, the conservative chancellor, and the finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, a Social Democrat, hoped to help restore confidence in the banking sector by meeting before the markets opened.    Shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, rose 3.1 percent Monday, leading German financial stocks generally higher.    The conditions placed on banking executives coincide with the debate that has been under way for months in Germany, where left-wing parties have demanded that curbs be placed on salaries earned by top bankers and corporate executives. They assert that highly paid executives are not held accountable for making poor investment decisions.    Under the terms of the cabinet decision, banks that decided to accept the bailout were to have the salaries of their executives capped at 500,000 euros a year as long as the banks were indebted to the state. They could also be forced to forgo bonuses and dividend payments, although that is not definite. In addition, dividends paid out by banks that take up the state package will be paid back into the state rescue fund.    The version enacted, however, is more vague, stating that salaries over  500,000 euros a year would be considered ""inappropriate,"" according to a copy e-mailed by the finance ministry. That still is more precise than the British or French bailouts, which contain more commitments about limiting executive pay.    ""The government is counting on managers reading the way the wind is blowing and volunteering a cap on wages to save their bank,"" Otto Bernhardt, the parliamentary finance spokesman for Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and chairman of a joint committee reviewing manager pay, told Bloomberg News. ""There's enormous ill feeling among the population about bank pay --  500,000 euros is nearly double the chancellor's pay.""    The government will be allowed to examine the business policies of banks that sign up to the capital injection package and will be allowed block investment decisions it regards as too risky.    Germany's big banks were not rushing to apply for a capital injection. Deutsche Bank's chairman, Josef Ackermann, said his bank did not need additional capital -- after weeks of pushing for a government rescue plan.    ""I would be ashamed if we were to take state money during this crisis,"" Mr. Ackermann said. Thomas Steg, the government spokesman, called Mr. Ackermann's comments ""totally incomprehensible and objectionable.""    Commentators in Germany said Mr. Ackermann might be reluctant to seek help because it would mean opening the bank, and possibly even his contract, to scrutiny.    Mr. Ackermann received compensation totaling 14 million euros last year, which included benefits and shares. Martin Blessing, chief executive since May of Commerzbank, Germany's second largest, received 2 million euros, not including shares and other benefits, according to the bank.    Merrill Lynch analysts estimated on Monday that Deutsche Bank would require a further capital increase of 8.9 billion euros and Commerzbank 6.2 billion euros. Mr. Blessing, the Commerzbank chief, said he would look at the government's package and see ""whether it comes into question for us.""    Unlike the bailout adopted by the United States, Germany is not insisting that banks accept the support.    Bavaria's state bank, BayernLB said it wanted money from the package as soon as possible. ""It's about achieving a fast stabilization,"" said Erwin Huber, finance minister of Bavaria, who is chairman of the administrative board of BayernLB.    Speaking to ZDF public television, Mr. Huber said it was unclear how much the bank required in terms of fresh capital. But he said he believed it would have to be restructured, merged with another bank or partly privatized.       ",2008-10-21
124,1886576952.xml,"BERLIN -- As many as three explosions damaged the bus of one of Germany's most storied soccer teams as it headed to its stadium in Dortmund on Tuesday, wounding one player and forcing postponement of the match, an important playoff in a major European championship.The Dortmund police chief, Gregor Lange, said at a late-night news conference that ""we assume it was a targeted attack"" on the Borussia Dortmund team. The wounded player, Marc Bartra of Spain, was undergoing surgery on his right wrist, a spokesman for the team said.Hans-Joachim Watzke, Borussia Dortmund's chief executive, said that ""three explosive devices"" had detonated near a hotel outside Dortmund where the players were staying.The state prosecutor told reporters that a letter claiming responsibility had been discovered near the site of the blasts, but that it was too soon to say if it was genuine. The prosecutor, Sandra Lücke, declined to answer further questions about the letter's contents, including what language it was written in.The authorities also would not describe the three explosive devices. Mr. Lange said that a fourth ""suspicious object"" had also been found at the scene, but that it had not been set to go off. Photographs of the bus showed that the rear window had been shattered, and the tires appeared to have been blown out.In an interview with Blick, a Swiss newspaper, the goalkeeper Roman Bürki described the moments after what he said was a ""huge bang"" as the bus turned onto the main road to go to the stadium.""I was sitting in the very back row next to Marc Bartra, who was hit by fragments of the broken rear window,"" said Mr. Bürki, who is Swiss. All the players then ducked and lay on the bus floor, he said, because ""we didn't know if something more would happen.""He added: ""The police were there quickly and sealed everything off. We are all shocked -- in those minutes, no one was thinking about football.""On Twitter, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain wished a ""speedy recovery"" for Mr. Bartra, 26, who played with Barcelona for seven seasons before joining Dortmund last year.The match, against Monaco, will be played on Wednesday night, the first leg of a quarterfinal in the UEFA Champions League.In a Twitter post, the Dortmund police told fans: ""We are preparing for a big deployment and will take care of security"" at the match on Wednesday.Anxiety over terrorism instigated or inspired by the Islamic State and other extremist groups operating in Europe has risen steadily over the past few years after bloody assaults in France, Belgium, Britain and, most recently, Sweden.In Germany on Dec. 19, a truck crashed into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people.Soccer has also figured in Germany's recent brushes with terrorism. The country's national team was playing France in Paris in November 2015 when the deadliest terrorist attacks in the French capital opened with a suicide bomber blowing himself up outside the stadium.Days later, the German authorities postponed the national team's next international match, in Hanover against the Netherlands, after receiving what security officials termed credible threats of an attack. In that episode, thousands of fans had already reached the stadium when the last-minute postponement was announced. Precise details about the tip or any evidence have not emerged.On Tuesday at the Westfalenstadion, the stadium where the match was to be played, hundreds of Monaco fans, hearing the news, chanted ""Dortmund! Dortmund!"" in a show of solidarity. In what has become another signal of support when terrorist assaults disrupt people's plans, Dortmund fans quickly adopted a hashtag offering Monaco fans places to stay.Chancellor Angela Merkel, an avowed soccer fan, often attends important international matches. Her chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, condemned the attack on Twitter. ""A despicable, cowardly deed, whoever did it,"" he wrote. He thanked the police, fans and players for staying calm and doing their duty.Borussia Dortmund is one of Germany's most successful teams, dating to the late 19th century when soccer first came to Germany from England.Dortmund, in the heavily populated Ruhr industrial region, is the site of a national museum dedicated to the sport that opened less than two years ago.The match to be played on Wednesday will demand extra effort from the shocked players, Mr. Watzke said. ""The question is, can we forget the scenes of today?"" he added.This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

2918,815943704.xml,"      WASHINGTON -- When the European Parliament ordered a halt in February to an American government program to monitor international banking transactions for terrorist activity, the Obama administration was blindsided by the rebuke.    ""Paranoia runs deep especially about US intelligence agencies,"" a secret cable from the American Embassy in Berlin said. ""We were astonished to learn how quickly rumors about alleged U.S. economic espionage"" had taken root among German politicians who opposed the program, it said.    The memo was among dozens of State Department cables that revealed the deep distrust of some traditional European allies toward what they considered American intrusion into their citizens' affairs without stringent oversight.   The program, created in secrecy by the Bush administration after the  Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has allowed American counterterrorism officials to examine  banking transactions routed through a vast database run by a Brussels consortium known as Swift. When the program was disclosed in 2006 by The New York Times, just months after the newspaper reported the existence of the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program, it set off protests in Europe and forced the United States to accept new restrictions.    But by  2010, new leaders at the European Parliament   had what one State Department memo called ""a fixation"" on privacy issues. On Feb. 10, the Europeans   voted 378 to 196  to halt the Swift program.    Obama administration officials valued it  because it allowed them to trace the transactions of suspected terrorist financiers while including ""robust"" privacy protections, according to the cables.    But many Europeans were skeptical. Some allies not only were concerned that program might be used to steal secrets from  European companies, but also considered it of ""dubious"" value.   In Austria, for example, ""the Nazi legacy and familiarity with communist regimes"" have fueled ""a widespread presumption against government data collection and in favor of stringent privacy protections,"" officials at the  embassy wrote.   Many Germans, meanwhile, remember ""how the Stasi,"" the former East German secret police, ""abused information to destroy people's lives,"" according to a dispatch from the American Embassy in Berlin.   Opposition in Germany was particularly damaging because the country was among a handful of allies that, according to a 2006 cable, organized a ""coalition of the constructive""  to ensure that the Swift operation was not ""ruined by privacy experts.""    After German representatives voted against the program, a German official reported to American diplomats that Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a strong supporter of the program -- was ""angrier than he had ever seen her.""   After mobilizing top  officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., the administration was able to reverse course. The European Parliament voted 484 to 109 in July to restart the program after the United States made modest concessions that promised greater European oversight.       ",2010-12-06
773,434160020.xml,"      More than 20 people were killed in violent clashes in Russia's North Caucasus region in the last two days, including a mysterious attack on seven women in a sauna, underscoring the Kremlin's continued struggles to bring the volatile area under control.    In one of the first attacks, on Thursday night, about 10 men opened fire with automatic weapons on a police post in the city of Buinaksk in Dagestan, killing four officers, the investigative branch of the prosecutor general's office said in a statement. The gunmen then entered the sauna complex a short distance away and killed seven women who worked there, in a rare attack on unarmed civilians.    ""After the crime, the unidentified men fled the scene with weapons stolen from the murdered police officers,"" Nimizam Radzhabov, a spokesman for the Dagestan prosecutor's investigative team, told Channel One, a Russian TV station.    In neighboring Chechnya, a gun battle between the police and two men suspected of belonging to a militant group erupted at almost the same time, investigators said. Both suspected militants were killed in the fight. Four police officers also died, and four others were wounded.    On Friday, gunmen killed two traffic police officers in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, Interfax reported. Three suspected militants were also killed in Dagestan on Friday in a separate episode.    The clashes were among the bloodiest to hit the largely Muslim region in recent months, though bloodshed occurs almost daily, particularly in Chechnya, Dagestan and another North Caucasus republic, Ingushetia. This week, Ingushetia's construction minister was killed by gunmen in his office, just as the republic's president, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, was planning to return to work after being seriously wounded in a suicide attack on his convoy in late June.    Most of the violence centers on fighting between the police and various radical Islamist or more secular separatist organizations, some of which are remnants of the militant groups that fought federal forces in Chechnya's two wars. Also common is violence among organized crime groups and competing ethnic clans.    Although civilians are targets less frequently, three human rights workers were murdered in Chechnya in the last month. Just this week, the leader of a charity that helped children scarred by the war there was kidnapped and murdered along with her husband, who also worked for the organization. And in July, Natalya Estemirova, who for years had documented the abductions and kidnappings that continue to plague Chechnya, was kidnapped and killed.    No suspects have yet been named in these cases or in many other murders of prominent human rights workers focused on the Caucasus.   Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, reiterated during a meeting on Friday with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, his commitment to solving these and other high-profile murders.   ""I have given all the necessary orders, as I did last time, to find the murderers, bring them to justice and punish them,"" he said. ""This is the priority task of all law enforcement agencies.""      ",2009-08-15
105,1692222551.xml,"       ATHENS --  Greece missed a crucial debt payment to the International Monetary Fund, the fund said early Wednesday, deepening a crisis that has haunted world leaders and financial markets over the past week.  The development came as Greece's European creditors each rejected an 11th-hour attempt by Athens to extend the country's international bailout program. Greece is not technically in default, but missing the payment of 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, is yet another warning that the country will probably be unable to meet its other obligations in coming weeks, to its bond holders and to the European Central Bank. That might make the bank, one of the country's chief creditors, less willing to continue emergency loans that have been propping up Greek banks for the past several months.  By declaring Greece in arrears, the I.M.F. avoided using the term ""default."" Credit rating agencies also will not consider Greece in default based on missing the I.M.F. payment, because the I.M.F. is not considered a commercial lender. But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said late Tuesday night that Greece was effectively in default and could face even tougher conditions for a new aid package.  ""I think the fact of the matter is that Greece is in default or will be in default tomorrow morning on the I.M.F. and also, I believe, on a loan to their own central bank,"" Mr. Dijsselbloem told CNBC. ""But they will be in default, and I don't think I can alter that in the short term.""  Greece now joins the roster of countries -- including some of the poorest and worst governed -- that have missed payments to the I.M.F. Also on that list: Zimbabwe, Sudan and Somalia.  With just hours to go before the deadline for the payment, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had asked the other nations that use the euro to provide another bailout that could also buy Athens time to renegotiate its crippling debt load. Finance ministers of those countries discussed the proposal on Tuesday night and left open the possibility that Greece could eventually win a new aid package, but dashed any hopes Athens had for immediate action. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had said earlier in the day that no deal with Mr. Tsipras's government could be negotiated until after a referendum on Sunday in which Greeks will be asked to accept or reject an offer made last week by Greece's creditors. Greece's missed payment was the largest in the fund's history. Sudan still owes about $1.4 billion from loans acquired in the 1980s, according to the fund.  Other countries that have fallen behind more recently include Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan. All three eventually settled their obligations to the fund. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said delinquency would put Greece in ignoble company.  ""They are joining countries we would normally regard as failed and failing states,"" Mr. Kirkegaard said. ""The symbolism is quite dramatic."" The I.M.F. declined to comment on whether it expected Greece to make the payment it just missed sometime in the future. The fund has not granted a request to delay repayment since the 1980s, making it highly unlikely that Greece would be given different treatment. The change of policy came about because the fund determined that giving extensions to countries that fell into arrears did not produce benefits for those countries.  The fund would still take into account the request by the Athens government for an extension. But any final decision is likely to take several weeks.  Apostolos Gkoutzinis, a partner in London with the New York law firm Shearman & Sterling and the head of the firm's European capital markets group, said Greece would eventually have to make good on the missed payment in order to avoid the risk that the I.M.F. would make no further loans. ""Without the I.M.F., the Greeks really have no safety net,"" Mr. Gkoutzinis said. ""Without that backstop, Greece might not even be able to import essential goods like medicines and petrol in the future.""  On Tuesday, Mr. Tsipras had requested more aid from the European bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, but a new program would require a number of procedural steps and raise significant new challenges for Greece.  ""Any talks about a future program will have to be discussed in the Eurogroup"" and ""will have to be assessed by the institutions,"" Mr. Dijsselbloem said Tuesday night. He was referring to the three institutions -- the European Commission, the I.M.F. and the Central Bank -- that oversee Greece's compliance with the terms of the two giant bailouts it has been granted in the last five years. The confirmation of the missed payment came after top European Union officials outlined another offer to Mr. Tsipras on Monday night, which suggested that both sides were interested in defusing a crisis that has left Greece financially crippled and at risk of becoming the first nation to leave the euro currency union.  France and the United States, among other nations, have been pressing for a compromise that could avert the risk of Greece's problems spreading to other countries and reduce the strain on European unity. With the nation's banks shut down and Mr. Tsipras's government confronting intensifying financial strains, his office released a statement Tuesday afternoon confirming that the government had proposed a new bailout from a different pot of money than the one drawn on so far. The statement was vague, noting that Greece had applied for a two-year agreement for new loans from the European Stability Mechanism. The statement said that the aim was to help the country meet its debt obligations and that Greece's intention was to remain in the eurozone. The lack of specificity in the statement made it unclear whether it was just a repackaging of previous requests -- already rejected in Brussels, the base of the European Union -- or if the prime minister had offered new proposals.  Hours earlier, Mr. Tsipras spoke by telephone with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission; Mario Draghi, the chief of the European Central Bank; and Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament. And in the Greek government, competing voices were debating how to proceed, analysts said. ""What is certain is that there is a lot of pressure inside the government,"" said George Pagoulatos, a political analyst in Athens. ""There are some people there who realize the huge risks in the path the country is on."" Negotiations have been going on for months, as Greece sought to unlock a frozen [euro]7.2 billion bailout payment and complete a new comprehensive agreement that would include more financing and could come with major debt relief. But the talks broke down last weekend, after Mr. Tsipras unexpectedly announced that a ""yes or no"" national referendum would be held so voters could decide whether to accept the terms proposed by creditors, which he found onerous. Mr. Tsipras has called on voters to choose ""no"" and has denied that the referendum is the equivalent of choosing whether to leave Europe's currency union, something that most Greeks do not want to do. Pro-Europe demonstrators massed in Syntagma Square in Athens outside Parliament on Tuesday night despite drizzle, thunder and lightning. As speakers began shouting, ""Vote yes to Europe,"" the demonstrators shouted and blew whistles. Some waved Greek flags, others red flags bearing the words ""YES to Europe. YES to the Euro."" Alexandros Limniatis, 67, who retired from the telephone company OTE, said he had been frustrated with the governing Syriza party since it took office this year. But the last straw, he said, came on Monday, the first day of capital controls, when he found himself waiting in a long A.T.M. line to receive his daily cash allotment of [euro]60. ""I went home to my grandchildren and I thought, 'What Greece am I leaving them?' "" he said, twisting the strand of worry beads he had taken up since the doctor told him to quit smoking. ""So I made up my mind to come here to demand hope. Greece in Europe. A European Greece."" Initially, European officials were furious about Mr. Tsipras's decision to call a referendum, interpreting the move as brinkmanship in the negotiations. But on Monday, several European leaders, notably Mr. Juncker, began openly lobbying Greek voters to choose ""yes."" Some analysts said European officials were hoping that a ""yes"" vote on Sunday would force Mr. Tsipras to resign, a development that would be welcome to the creditors after months of bitter clashes with Athens.  Some European officials have been signaling that they would like to use the coming days to try to persuade Mr. Tsipras to stop pushing for a ""no"" vote -- an unlikely prospect given the consistent position Mr. Tsipras has taken against the terms offered so far by the creditors.

2029,1124600020.xml,"       CORRECTION APPENDEDBERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany met with Turkey's prime minister here on Wednesday and pledged that the European Union would continue to pursue talks ""in good faith"" over Turkey's accession to the bloc, despite disagreements that have proved challenging for both sides. ""The E.U. is an honest negotiating partner,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""These negotiations will continue irrespective of the questions that we have to clarify."" Her pledge came after the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, warned that the European Union stood in danger of losing Turkey if it was not granted membership by 2023. ""No other country has been kept waiting, knocking on the door of the E.U., for such a long time,"" Mr. Erdogan told a gathering in Berlin late Tuesday, hours after he opened his country's new embassy to Germany. An ever stronger economic and political force in the region, Turkey has been in negotiations to join the bloc since 2005, and some analysts have worried that a frustrated Turkey might shift from its Western focus to building stronger ties with Moscow and Tehran. Despite Turkey's status as a NATO ally and its long-running ties to much of Europe, Germany, France, Austria and the Netherlands have never fully warmed to the idea of granting it full European Union membership. Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union has even suggested that Turkey be granted instead a special status in the form of a ""privileged partnership."" On Wednesday, the chancellor insisted that she and the Turkish leader had been able to work together despite their differences on membership. She praised the openness with which Turkey had accepted the flood of refugees -- estimated at more than 100,000 -- who have poured in from Syria and the ""prudence"" with which Mr. Erdogan's government had handled the recent threat of escalating frictions at the border. She also pledged German humanitarian assistance ""wherever needed"" to help Turkey cope, acknowledging that the Syrian refugees were ""a real strain"" on the country. Neither she nor Mr. Erdogan broached the issue of whether the rest of Europe would be asked to take in Syrians. Germany is Turkey's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $40.7 billion in 2011, despite the economic crisis in Europe. To explain the strength of the Turkish economy, Mr. Erdogan points to austerity measures and restructuring programs pushed through by his government, in similar scale to those being sought by Germany in several of the European Union's weaker member states. Given the potential for tensions, the two leaders seemed generally relaxed with each other. Even reference to Cyprus, home to one of Europe's most intractable ethnic divides and the reason Turkish accession talks have ground to a halt, did not overshadow their appearance. The island is broken into the mainly Turkish-speaking north -- occupied by Turkey since an invasion in 1974 -- and the mainly Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus in the south, which the European Union recognizes exclusively. The republic currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency. Ms. Merkel refrained from comment after Mr. Erdogan said that she had told him in the past that accepting a divided Cyprus into the union had been a mistake. Mr. Erdogan also took a dig at the republic on Tuesday night, asking whether it was really ""southern Cyprus"" that wielded so much power. The European Commission has said that Turkey must not only bend on Cyprus, but it also has a long way to go before its standards on human rights and freedom of speech can reach the levels required for membership. Turkey's minister for European Union affairs, Egemen Bagis, pointed out earlier in Berlin the progress that his country had made on human rights and freedom of speech since Mr. Erdogan's party came into power about 10 years ago. He cited Kurdish language broadcasts and the restitution of property rights to religious minorities as examples of what he called ""a much more democratic and transparent"" country.

848,878807306.xml,"      PARIS -- Arnaud Lagardere, the French billionaire who has been widely expected to become the chairman of the European aerospace group EADS next year, became an unwitting Internet sensation this past week after a Belgian magazine released a video of him posing and cuddling with his young, supermodel girlfriend.   Some media commentators are calling the video of the 50-year-old heir and chief executive of the Lagardere empire an embarrassment.   The nearly three-minute video -- more Fashion TV than the financial news -- has received more than half a million hits since it was posted on the YouTube video-sharing site Wednesday. It was shot as Mr. Lagardere and Jade Foret, a 20-year-old fashion model, posed recently for photos to accompany a cover story in the weekend magazine of Le Soir, a Belgian newspaper. The video shows Mr. Lagardere and Ms. Foret kissing and embracing as they discuss how they met and fell in love this year.    While the video is unlikely to ruffle many feathers within Mr. Lagardere's publishing business, which includes magazine titles like Elle and Paris Match, it has been viewed with consternation in the more buttoned-down world of aerospace and arms making. And it has placed the Frenchman in the spotlight at a sensitive time for the board and crucial shareholders of EADS, formally European Aeronautic Defense and Space, and its Airbus subsidiary, who have come under pressure from management to create a new governance structure.    Louis Gallois, the EADS chief executive, said in June that he and other top group managers were pressing for a new arrangement that would allow any investor to buy or sell shares freely in the company, while still preserving the delicate balance of influence between France and Germany in its governance.    A shareholder pact that dates from the group's creation in 2000 stipulates that the French and German stakes in EADS must be equal.    Currently, Mr. Lagardere's company owns a 7.5 percent stake in EADS while the French government holds 15 percent. Daimler, the German automaker, owns 15 percent and an alliance of German private and public sector banks holds 7.5 percent.   But both Daimler and Mr. Lagardere have made clear in recent years that they do not view their EADS holdings as core to their operations, and the French and German governments have struggled to broker a sale of the shares to other investors in a way that would preserve the ownership balance.    A management revamping brokered in 2007 by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, placed Mr. Gallois, a Frenchman, at the helm of EADS and Thomas Enders, a German, in charge of Airbus, the group's largest business unit, for five years. The chairmanship of the group was awarded to a German under the proviso that Mr. Lagardere -- also a close friend of Mr. Sarkozy -- would take over that post in mid-2012.    But in recent years, Mr. Lagardere, who holds a seat on the EADS board, has appeared increasingly uninterested in his company's aerospace assets. They are a legacy of his father, Jean-Luc, the former chief of Matra, a military contractor that was merged into Airbus.    Many in the French and German news media have reacted to the video with scorn. The German business daily Handelsblatt and the French newspaper Le Monde described it as embarrassing and disturbing, while Liberation, another French daily, likened the video to a soap opera. Challenges, a French newsweekly, found it ""stupefying.""   Mr. Gallois told The Wall Street Journal as recently as last month that he expected the board would appoint Mr. Lagardere chairman next year. Alexander Reinhardt, an EADS spokesman, would not be drawn into answering what implications, if any, could follow from the video controversy.   Ramzi Khiroun, a spokesman for Mr. Lagardere, did not return calls requesting comment.      ",2011-07-23

Protesters organized by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, gather to protest against the government's coronavirus policies at Alexanderplatz in Berlin on May 16, 2020. The pandemic marginalized the far right, as Germans rallied behind Chancellor Angela Merkel but the reopening has brought them back, and they are preparing to seize new opportunities. (Emile Ducke/The New York Times)


BERLIN — Outside Germany’s Parliament building, a vegan celebrity cook grabbed the mic and shouted that he was “ready to die” to stop self-serving elites from using the pandemic to topple the world order. Some distance away, a group of women discussed how Bill Gates was plotting to force immunization on the population. Youngsters sporting cardboard cutouts of the German Constitution chanted: “End the corona dictatorship!” Few wore masks, and those that did came with slogans like “Merkel’s muzzle.”
Even as Germany is celebrated as Europe’s foremost example of pandemic management, an eclectic protest movement that began last month with a few dozen people marching against coronavirus restrictions has ballooned into more than 10,000 demonstrators in cities across the country.
The one driving force behind the mobilization is the country’s far right, particularly the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which had been marginalized by the pandemic. Now, the AfD’s leaders see the protests as a first step toward moving back into the national conversation, using them to position their message for the months ahead, when Germany must confront job losses and a battered economy.
“The crisis is coming, it isn’t here yet,” said Nicolaus Fest, head of Berlin’s AfD chapter, who was protesting near the Brandenburg Gate on Saturday. “Some time soon, a lot of people will be unemployed.”
Alongside anti-vaxxers, anti-capitalists, and ordinary citizens concerned about job losses and safety at reopened nurseries and schools, the marches have attracted neo-Nazis, hooligans and, consistently, members of the AfD, a party best known for its noisy nationalism and anti-immigrant views.
They rarely organize the protests. But the AfD and more extreme far-right groups are trying to capitalize on the discontent as they begin positioning themselves for what may be a much uglier political scene some months from now if the economy deteriorates further, as most economists expect.
“When the depression hits and people really start feeling it, they will start asking: Who do we share the little that is left with? Who belongs and who does not?” said Götz Kubitscheck, a far-right publisher and the most prominent ideologue of Germany’s so-called New Right.
Then, Kubitschek predicted in a recent interview, “it will become a question of identity.”
Germany’s domestic intelligence office, which recently classified both Kubitschek’s Institute for State Politics and a group of AfD politicians close to him as extremist, is worried.
“We see a trend that extremists, especially far-right extremists, are weaponizing the demonstrations,” Thomas Haldenwang, president of the agency, told the German newspaper Welt on Sunday. “There is a risk that far-right extremists, with their image of who the enemy is and their ambitions to undermine the state, will take the lead of a movement that for now is attended mostly by citizens who are loyal to the constitution.”
“We are concerned that extremists are using the current situation in exactly the same way as the so-called refugee crisis,” Haldenwang said.
Some have already compared the coronavirus protests to the protests against the refugee crisis in 2015, when PEGIDA — Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West — drew hundreds and then thousands of marchers every week before turning into a potent incubator of far-right extremism.
“We are the people,” the slogan associated with PEGIDA marches, is now popular at the coronavirus protests, too.
Then as now, Chancellor Angela Merkel was celebrated as an exemplary leader who navigated her country through extraordinary circumstances.
But in early 2016, the mood began to shift. A year later, the AfD became the first far-right party to enter the federal Parliament since World War II. It is now the biggest opposition party, with seats in every state legislature in the country.
Some lawmakers from Merkel’s Christian Democrats speak privately of a sense of déjà vu — and worry that by the time the next election is scheduled, in the fall of 2021, the AfD might once again eat into conservative votes.
The pandemic arrived in Germany at a moment when the influence of the far right, and its ability to crack open the political system from the local level up, was strong. Mainstream parties, Merkel’s Christian Democrats included, worried about losing votes.
As recently as February, the fallout from an inconclusive election in the eastern state of Thuringia, where a particularly extreme chapter of the AfD became the second-strongest party, ultimately brought down the chancellor’s anointed successor in Berlin.
When the virus began spreading, the situation changed. Almost overnight, Germans rallied behind their chancellor and the monthlong shutdown that slowed the spread of the virus and allowed the country to get through its first wave of infections with a relatively low death toll.
But now that very success has become one thing driving the protests.
“They told us this virus was so dangerous that we had to give up all our democratic freedoms,” said Sabine Martin, a mother of two who marched in Berlin on Saturday for the third weekend in a row. “But we are no fools: Our hospitals are half empty.”
“I’m not afraid of this virus,” she added. “I’m afraid of the recession.”
Some call it the prevention paradox: Because Germany has been relatively successful in containing the disease, it is becoming harder to persuade people that the pandemic still presents a real danger, and easier for conspiracy theorists and populists to spin narratives of deceit.
“This so-called pandemic is nothing but the flu,” scoffed Robert Farle, a state lawmaker of the AfD. He has been joining protests in his eastern hometown, Magdeburg.

In Berlin, the AfD dominated one of about 20 protests, each limited to 50 people, near the Brandenburg Gate. “Germany,” “Constitution” and “Freedom,” their signs read.
But in conversation, the topic quickly returned to the AfD’s hallmark issue of immigration. Several of the protesters felt vindicated by a crisis that forced Germany to swiftly close its borders.
“They shut the borders, they stopped refugees from coming in,” Kubitschek, the far-right publisher said. “It proves that it can all be done.”

For now, despite the noise they make, the protesters remain a small minority. A recent survey found that 2 in 3 Germans are satisfied with the government’s response to the crisis. Six out of 10 say they are not worried if certain freedoms have to be curtailed for longer. Merkel’s party remains the most popular in the country, with nearly 4 in 10 voters saying they would support it, the highest level since 2017.
But the European Commission expects the German economy to shrink by 6.5% this year, the worst performance since World War II. The AfD’s popularity, which early on in the crisis slumped below 10%, has begun to edge up.
Many worry that a prolonged economic slump might open up new voter potential for the party, which has found most of its support in the former communist East. The biggest protests in recent weeks, however, have been in Stuttgart, the wealthy western heartland of Germany’s car industry.
In the seven years since the AfD was founded, Germany has consistently enjoyed economic growth and low unemployment, said Matthias Quent, an expert on far-right extremism and the director of an institute that studies democracy and civil society. “We just don’t know what the AfD looks like in a recession,” Quent said. “It worries me,” he added. “Historically, big recessions tend to feed populist narratives.”

And it is not just the AfD that has seen the fallout from the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity.
Message boards are flush with far-right conspiracy theories and prepper groups, which have long fantasized about a crisis so deep that it would lead to the collapse of Germany’s liberal order, said Stephan Kramer, the head of the regional office of the domestic intelligence agency in Thuringia.
“They are mobilizing,” Kramer said. “The corona crisis feeds into their narrative of a decline in Western liberalism. It feeds militancy and potentially violence.”
The authorities are on high alert. Over the past year, far-right terrorists have assassinated a regional politician on his front porch near Kassel, attacked a synagogue in Halle, and in February, killed 10 people in Hanau. Even before the pandemic hit Germany, far-right extremism and far-right terrorism had been officially identified as the biggest danger for the country’s democracy.
“That has not changed,” Kramer said. “On the contrary. This plays into their hands.”

620,1314287774.xml,"       BAD HERSFELD, GERMANY -- Manuel Sauer, a union activist, stood in front of Amazon's colossal gray distribution center here last Thursday, masquerading as the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, by holding up a cardboard cutout of a scowling Mr. Bezos. Television crews crowded in for the money shot.  Then Mr. Sauer and several other activists unfurled a banner demanding in a curious mix of German and English that Amazon, the American online retailing juggernaut, negotiate a union wage contract with its currently nonunion work force here. ""Make Tarif Vertrag,"" it said in fluorescent letters. Then the organizers marched toward the gates of the Amazon complex to deliver the results of an online petition drive supporting the union's demands.  That brief bit of guerrilla theater was the latest skirmish in an escalating battle between ver.di, one of the largest unions in Germany, and Amazon, which employs 8,000 permanent workers at eight distribution centers in the country, one of the online retailer's largest markets outside the United States. Deservedly or not, Amazon's labor relations have lately come under intense scrutiny by German media. The triggering event was a Feb. 12 broadcast by one of Germany's two main public television networks of a documentary about the treatment of some of the 10,000 temporary workers that Amazon hired last year to cope with the holiday rush. Many of those workers were bused in from countries like Spain or Romania where jobs are scarce.  Aired on ARD, a publicly financed broadcaster considered left of center, the documentary even implied that Amazon used neo-Nazi thugs to keep workers in line. It showed a team of security workers hired by an Amazon subcontractor roughing up a camera crew outside the temporary workers' quarters. The broadcast has since inspired countless headlines, preoccupied pundits on Germany's ubiquitous television talk shows and may even become an issue in national elections this autumn in which left-leaning Social Democrats will be challenging the government coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats.  The continuing furor raises the question of whether Amazon will be the latest big American company to run afoul of German labor laws, which provide much broader worker rights than in the United States.  Walmart abandoned Germany in 2006 following an array of setbacks that included a legal struggle with ver.di, which represents two million workers in service industries including retailing, hotels, food service and public transportation. The name is an abbreviation of Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, or United Service Industries Union. General Motor's Opel unit, represented by the IG Metall union in Germany, has struggled for more than a decade to cut costs and stem losses in the face of strong worker resistance. Last week, Opel finally struck a truce with its employees that will allow it to close a factory in Bochum, Germany, in 2016 -- but only after promising not to impose involuntary layoffs. Now it seems to be Amazon's turn to serve as a symbol for everything that many Germans resent about American-style management and so-called Anglo-Saxon capitalism. As an American company that has helped drive at least one German competitor out of business and makes heavy use of temporary workers, Amazon is a ripe target. More flexible job regulations, introduced since 2005, have contributed to a plunge in unemployment. Germany's 5.3 percent jobless rate is less than half the euro zone's overall rate of 11.9 percent. But the changes are perceived by many Germans as creating a class of poorly paid workers with few protections. Amazon's work force more than doubles every Christmas season when it hires an additional 10,000 temporary employees, many of them foreigners. Amazon, which already pays above the union rate, has refused to negotiate with the ver.di union on wages or any other issue. But so far Amazon seems to be doing a better job than Walmart did in German public relations.  Some of the security agents in the documentary who manhandled a camera crew wore clothing fashionable among neo-Nazis. The name of the security firm, as the film made clear, was also provocative: H.E.S.S., for Hensel European Security Service. Rudolf Hess, one of Adolf Hitler's deputies, remains a revered figure among right-wing extremists.  The firm denied any connection to extremist groups. But Amazon fired the security firm, nonetheless.  ""We are unhappy at what we saw,"" Dave Clark, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations, said by telephone from Seattle on Saturday. ""We've got to become world class in managing the accommodations of those folks versus delegating to a third party. That is a lesson we learned this holiday."" Heiner Reimann, a ver.di official, said that every year after Christmas he is flooded with complaints from temporary workers who say they were falsely led to believe they would get permanent jobs at Amazon if they met tough productivity requirements. He said that the nebulous status of temporary workers at Amazon is a year-round issue, but especially so right after the holiday, when large numbers of temps are let go.  But Mr. Clark countered that virtually all of Amazon's permanent employees in Germany started out as temporary workers.  He said Amazon was not importing the foreign workers portrayed in the television documentary because they were inexpensive, but because the company could not find enough people locally. Unemployment in Bad Hersfeld and the surrounding area is about 5 percent. ""If we had the ability to staff with local people we would have done it,"" he said. The company has expanded rapidly in Germany in recent years, generating $8.7 billion in the country last year as it provided Germans with a consumer cornucopia of everything from books and MP3 players to vacuum cleaners and kayaks. Of the company's eight distribution warehouses in Germany, which it calls fulfillment centers, six have opened since 2009. And more hiring is planned, Mr. Clark said. One of the union's other criticisms is that a Big Brother atmosphere prevails in Amazon distribution centers.  ""Everything is measured, everything is calculated, everything is geared toward efficiency,"" Mr. Reimann said. ""People want to be treated with respect.""  But Amazon also has its defenders in Bad Hersfeld, where the company is one of the main employers in this city of 30,000, optimally located in central Germany at the junction of two major highways.  Thomas Fehling, the mayor, said he condemned poor treatment of temporary workers reported in the German press. But he added, ""We have a very positive feeling about Amazon,"" which employs 2,500 people here.  Among local citizens, opinion about Amazon seems to be split. Some former employees writing to the Kreis Anzeiger, a local newspaper, complained of an unpleasant work atmosphere and extreme pressure to produce.  But one, who said he had worked 12 years for the company, disagreed. ""The work climate was and is always good,"" he wrote, ""and the co-workers as well as the lead managers are fine.""  For all its digital efficiencies, online commerce can be labor intensive. The German operation offers a mind-boggling assortment of products that besides clothing, sporting goods and home electronics includes more than 50 varieties of fondue sets. The products are fetched from storage racks by workers known as pickers, who may cover miles on foot in the course of a workday.  Customer orders are packed largely by hand, with productivity of individual employees closely monitored by software on the hand-held scanners workers use, and other means. ""Feedback"" sessions are held for those deemed insufficiently swift.  ""Our intent is not to spy with electronics, or to monitor with electronics in a punitive way,"" Mr. Clark said. ""We do expect our employees to perform."" Amazon's relentless focus on efficiency enables it to deliver most products the next day and often beat competitors on price. Neckermann, once among the largest catalog retailers in Germany, became insolvent last year in part because it was unable to compete successfully with Amazon online. A taxi driver in Bad Hersfeld, who did not want to be quoted by name because a close relative is still employed by Amazon, said he had worked as a picker one Christmas season and found the work demanding but not unreasonably so. It was less stressful than driving a taxi, he said. Mr. Fehling, the mayor, frames things in business terms. ""If you want a comfortable job, Amazon is definitely not for you,"" he said. ""Amazon is a performance-oriented company. Amazon is successful because people want those products and they want those prices."" There is no sign yet that the controversy stirred by the documentary is cooling.  Peer Steinbrück, leader of the Social Democrats, the largest party challenging Ms. Merkel's governing coalition, has recorded a video message in support of the online petition drive calling on Amazon to negotiate with the union. ""A strong company like Amazon doesn't need to use poor working conditions to create a competitive advantage,"" Mr. Steinbrück says in the video. He promises that, if elected, he will tighten rules governing temporary workers.  But Mr. Clark of Amazon said a union contract would not allow the company to pursue what it considers an innovative compensation system, which includes stock bonuses for all workers.  Amazon's policy of neither confronting nor engaging with the union was evident on Thursday, when the small group of ver.di organizers, including Mr. Reimann and Mr. Sauer with his Jeff Bezos prop, gathered outside the gates to one of Amazon's distribution centers on a hillside outside Bad Hersfeld. They had come to present 37,000 signatures gathered online. The activists were far outnumbered by reporters and camera crews, drawn by the prospect of a telegenic confrontation with management. But Amazon, it soon became clear, had decided to defuse the moment. Mr. Reimann pressed a buzzer next to the security gate. When a voice over the intercom asked who was calling, he demanded to be admitted to deliver the signatures. Unexpectedly, the gate opened, and Mr. Reimann and the other ver.di activists tramped across an enclosed metal bridge, trailed by journalists.  They were met inside by a trio of friendly receptionists, who cheerily issued visitor passes to everyone. Nearby, a table was piled with bananas and a sign, ""Amazon Fruit Day.""  As Mr. Reimann gave interviews to television reporters, photographers snapped Amazon workers on their way to a nearby cafeteria.  But soon came word: No Amazon officials would be meeting with Mr. Reimann's group this day. So the activists handed their box of signatures to the ever-beaming receptionists, and everyone left. Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

4031,2435073175.xml,"In the United States, despite historically high unemployment and unprecedented economic pain, Wall Street soared to a new high on Tuesday as the S&P 500 cruised past the record it set on Feb. 19, before the pandemic had tightened its grip on American life. Investors seem heartened that late summer hot spots have cooled a bit -- new coronavirus cases have declined by 16 percent over the last 14 days. But concerns remain. A new analysis said that workers in factories, in warehouses and at construction sites are at especially high risk of infection as businesses reopen. Will they come home infected?In Europe, case counts have crept up again. Will a second wave of restrictions become necessary?And, in a summer when people in much of the world look out from behind masks and try to remember social distancing, photographs and videos captured a party with none of that (although some partygoers strapped on life jackets and goggles with their swimsuits). It was a giant pool party in Wuhan, the city in central China where the pandemic began late last year. The images seemed to touch a nerve in a world where trepidation about public spaces and entertainment locales remains high. And where the thought of splashing around in a public pool is temptingly alluring, because doing so remains forbidden. The images also stood in contrast to photographs from late January that showed roads that were all but deserted and bulldozers that were clearing ground for a new hospital to treat coronavirus patients.The party in Wuhan on Saturday night had a D.J. and was attended by hundreds of people. It took place at a water park in conjunction with an electronic music festival at an adjacent amusement park. Both reopened in June, two months after a 76-day lockdown ended. On Monday, two days after the party, China reported 22 new coronavirus cases, according to Reuters, which cited a National Health Commission statement that said none had been locally transmitted.In the United States, communities are bracing for a possible new phase of the outbreak as schools try to open. Already, some colleges and universities have struggled to prevent fraternity and sorority houses from becoming virus clusters. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill called off in-person classes on Monday after identifying four clusters in student housing facilities, including one at the Sigma Nu fraternity.""The frats are being frats -- they are having their parties,"" said Lamar Richards, a sophomore.The analysis of risks to workers in the United States, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, came as the study focused on outbreaks in Utah from March to June and found that more than half of confirmed coronavirus cases were in manufacturing and construction or involved wholesalers. The researchers said that there were racial disparities across 15 sectors of the economy: Nearly three-quarters of all workplace-related cases were found in nonwhite workers, though only one-quarter of the overall work force was nonwhite.Another study posted by the medical journal JAMA concluded that Black and Latino people were far more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. But a separate study, also posted by JAMA, found that ethnicity was not related to the risk of dying from the disease later on.XXXChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said it was too soon to think about skipping basic, proven steps to curb the virus. And the prime minister of Finland put herself in isolation after reporting mild symptomsIn Germany, where the seven-day average of new cases climbed past 1,000 last week for the first time since May, Ms. Merkel said the country was still ""in the middle of the pandemic."" The growth is especially noteworthy because it is not linked to a single cluster but to a general rise in infections in the population at large. According to the Robert Koch Institute, the government's disease control and prevention agency, Germany's seven-day reproduction value on Monday was 1.04, meaning that each infected person was likely to transmit the virus to more than one person.""The good news is if we stick to the rules, a lot of public life is possible,"" she said on a trip to the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. ""If the numbers go back down, we can open up more. If they don't, or rise, we must ask what is needed.""""In any case,"" she added, ""a further easing of measures cannot take place now.""In Finland, Prime Minister Sanna Marin tweeted that she had ""mild respiratory symptoms."" A government spokesman said she had experienced ""mild flu symptoms,"" not ""straight Covid-19 symptoms."" Ms. Marin told Finnish news outlets that she thought she had caught a cold from her young daughter, who recently returned to day care. Finland, which has reported just under 7,800 cases since the pandemic began, posted no new coronavirus cases on six days last month. But cases have been trending upward since late July.XXXSeven people. That was an epidemiologist's answer to one of the puzzling questions about the resurgent outbreak in Australia's second-largest city that prompted a lockdown and some of the toughest restrictions in the world: Where did the second wave come from?On Tuesday the epidemiologist, Dr. Charles Alpren of the Department of Health and Human Services in Melbourne, told a state-appointed panel investigating failures in the quarantine system that the seven -- a family of four that quarantined in one hotel, and three travelers in another -- had been responsible for 99 percent of the infections in Melbourne since May. They seeded the outbreak, transmitting the virus to workers at the two hotels, who then carried it home, he said.The family of four arrived on May 9. Under rules requiring Australians returning from overseas to isolate in Melbourne hotels for two weeks, they checked into the hotel. There have been reports of confusion about whether guests were required to wear masks in the public areas of the hotel. There were also reports that government-contracted guards slept on the job.Dr. Alpren said the family was found to have the coronavirus within nine days. On May 25, three people who worked at the hotel were found to have been infected. He did not say whether the three were hotel employees or government-contracted guards, but by June, 17 people from the hotel or their close relatives had contracted the coronavirus.The outbreak at the second hotel infected 46 workers and their close contacts in June. It began with a man who arrived on June 1 and a couple who checked in on June 11, Dr. Alpren said. On Tuesday, Melbourne reported 222 new cases, the fewest in a month, and 17 deaths.Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-08-19
3934,1719884781.xml,"       As Europe continues to struggle with a steady flow of migrants and the challenges of how best to receive asylum seekers from war zones, The New York Times asked readers for their questions about the refugee crisis. We have addressed some issues and used other questions to help inform our reporting. Here are answers to some recent questions. Q. How will the cultural and religious aspects of so many (primarily Muslim) migrants impact E.U. society, especially at the local community levels? -- Joe, London A. The answer I got from most politicians, planners and business people in Stuttgart and Berlin was that, at a community level, it is crucial to integrate the new migrants, especially the young ones, as swiftly as possible. That means providing not only language, education and job training, but also access to the social and athletic clubs that bind many German communities. They can be the quickest route to integration. That did not happen in the 1970s and '80s with Turkish guest workers in cities such as Berlin, where for various reasons communities avoided mixing for years, and the consequences are still obvious. The president of the chamber of commerce for the state of Baden-Württemberg, which includes Stuttgart, was not very optimistic when he talked to me recently about the prospects for integrating so many people all at once. Many of the asylum seekers in Germany are not skilled workers, or are not trained to German labor standards, and they come from a very different culture. But nearly everyone else I spoke with pointed out that the rapidly declining German population has created an urgent need for skilled labor. The influx of migrants could be a gift, especially in underpopulated areas like Brandenburg and parts of eastern Germany, where workers are scarce and businesses are desperate. Daimler may not be hurting for job applicants, but many companies in places that are less affluent than Stuttgart do need workers. A newly trained work force, welcomed and integrated into German schools, neighborhoods and social clubs, might bring prosperity. Companies can help provide training. Cities still have to find housing that suits extended families so they can mix with the existing population, and avoid creating ghettos.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN Q. What are the reasons for Angela Merkel's decision to welcome refugees? How much is humanitarian, how much a need for younger people (taxpayers), how much a desire for labor -- cheap and otherwise? How much is prestige, how much World War II guilt? -- Isa Mara Lando, Rio de Janeiro A. You have correctly identified the various motives; all of them likely play a part in Ms. Merkel's decisions. In addition, I would note aspects of her biography: Ms. Merkel is the daughter of a Lutheran minister and she grew up in communist East Germany. The tone of her remarks since Germany received thousands of asylum seekers trapped in Hungary in early September has reflected a particular German obligation to offer asylum to those in danger that was not offered to Jews and other victims of the Nazis. But Ms. Merkel's words also reflect a concern and sympathy for her fellow humans that was surely part of her upbringing.  ALISON SMALE Q. Are all the refugees arriving in Europe illegally, dealing with smugglers using unsafe boats? Is there no legal, safe way for them to reach Europe? Do countries who feel an obligation to accept them also have an obligation to provide one? -- David Barnert, Albany, N.Y. A. Nearly all asylum seekers arrive illegally, in the sense that they do not have official entry visas. But the United Nations refugee convention states that people who face a clear danger of persecution or threat to their lives have a right to seek protection in another country, even when they do not have prior approval to enter that country. All asylum seekers can, in theory, apply in their home country for visas at the embassy of the country that they want to enter, but this is a long and laborious process. It also tends to weed out people who do not have a legitimate case for asylum; migrants who are seeking better economic opportunities usually prefer to take their chances and pay smugglers to get them to Europe before applying. Some of these migrants might believe that once they are in a country, it will be very difficult for that country to get them to leave if they are not granted asylum. Lots of people are rejected, but few are deported. And the process can take years. Countries that are party to the United Nations convention are obliged to examine the asylum claim of anyone who shows up at their border asking for refuge, but they are not obliged to provide safe passage to that border. It is up to the refugee to get to wherever he or she wants to go. ANDREW HIGGINS Credit: THE NEW YORK TIMES A Refugee Family On the Serbian-Croatian Frontier Last Month.

1552,1696831861.xml,"       BERLIN --  Chancellor Angela Merkel's response to a tearful Palestinian girl who pleaded for her family to be allowed to stay in Germany drew both praise and criticism on Thursday, as a video of the encounter spread across the Internet. The video, taken as Ms. Merkel met with a group of students in Rostock on Wednesday, shows the girl asking to avoid deportation, so she can pursue her teenage dreams and enjoy the same security as her German friends. ""I'm here now,"" she says, ""but I don't know what my future looks like as long as I don't really know that I can stay here."" The girl's plea put a human face to the quandary of tens of thousands of newcomers from Syria, other parts of the Middle East and Africa, who have been pouring into Europe seeking economic opportunities and shelter from strife. Many are applying for refugee status, saying that they would be in danger if they returned to their homelands. Germany, along with Italy, had been pressing for a European Union proposal that is all but dead, that would assign member nations a quota of migrants. So far, Italy has borne the brunt of the problem, as thousands make the perilous journey by boat across the Mediterranean and enter Europe at its southernmost border. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have entered Germany in the last year, hoping to share in its strong economy. Ms. Merkel's government has repeatedly emphasized the need to welcome the newcomers and to provide housing and other services, even as a right-wing anti-immigrant movement has grown and taken to the streets in protest. But in the encounter with the girl, Ms. Merkel pointed out that not every migrant can find shelter in Europe, and that not every applicant for asylum or other legal status can be approved. ""Politics is sometimes hard,"" the chancellor says in the video. ""Some people will have to go back."" News reports said that the girl, identified only by her first name, Reem, had been in Germany for four years and narrowly avoided deportation. The chancellor's office on Thursday declined to reveal her age or last name. She was among 32 mostly teenage students who were assembled Wednesday in the Baltic port of Rostock for one of the chancellor's sessions in a listening campaign called Gut Leben in Deutschland, or Living Well in Germany. The young Palestinian spends several minutes calmly explaining her story to Ms. Merkel in fluent German, mentioning that her father is forbidden to work because the family does not have a permanent residence permit; that she hopes to go to university; and that she would love to feel as secure as her peers in enjoying their teenage lives. In the video, Ms. Merkel is seen listening sympathetically before explaining to Reem that not everybody can come to Germany and stay here.  She mentions the possibility that Reem might profit from expedited procedures that Germany is putting in place for asylum seekers. But that policy may well result in more deportations. When Reem starts to cry, Ms. Merkel approaches her, pats her on the shoulder and praises her for her articulate presentation of her family's plight. By Thursday, the video of the encounter had provoked criticism of Ms. Merkel as hardhearted and was trending on Twitter under the hashtag #merkelstreichelt, a reference to the chancellor's effort to comfort the girl. But the chancellor also had her defenders, including Ines Pohl, a well-known journalist and the former editor of the leftist daily known as Taz. Ms. Merkel could have taken the political path and offered some individual examination of the case of Reem's family, Ms. Pohl wrote. Instead, ""the chancellor was honest and certainly not cold.""

117,1686947699.xml,"       FRANKFURT -- The contrarian American billionaire Wilbur L. Ross Jr. made a bundle betting on the Irish banking system when it was down and out, and a similar wager on Cyprus now looks promising. But Greece may prove to be the toughest test yet of his knack for cashing in on eurozone crisis spots. Mr. Ross, who built his career investing in distressed assets, is the ringleader of a group of investors who last year pumped 1.3 billion euros, or about $1.47 billion, into Eurobank Ergasias, the third-largest bank in Greece. In the weeks to come, the fate of Mr. Ross's money -- along with the whole Greek financial system -- may hinge on whether the country's leftist government can avoid the chaos that would accompany an exit from the eurozone. In the interim, Greek banks are in a perilous state. The uncertainty about the country's future means that Greek banks cannot raise cash on the international monetary markets. Without cash, the banks cannot lend. The result is a vicious circle in which businesses cannot get credit, hurting employment and profits and causing tax receipts to decline just when the government in Athens desperately needs cash. No wonder Mr. Ross is rooting for the Greek government to make peace with its creditors -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the other eurozone countries -- and unlock more aid. A debt deal seemed as elusive as ever on Tuesday, when officials in Brussels reacted coolly to revised Greek proposals meant to end a monthslong standoff, saying the proposals backpedaled on fiscal targets recently agreed to by both sides. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had tentative plans to meet in Brussels on Wednesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France in another effort to break the impasse. Whatever hardships Mr. Tsipras's government fears under the tough terms its creditors might be demanding, Mr. Ross says Greece could have even more of a struggle trying to go it alone with a bankrupt banking system. ""A default and a removal from the euro would provoke even worse austerity than anything being proposed by the institutions,"" Mr. Ross said in an interview. On paper, Mr. Ross and the other investors have already lost hundreds of millions of euros. Eurobank shares have fallen by more than half since April 2014, when Mr. Ross and a group he leads bought a stake of a little more than 20 percent. The shares recently traded around 13 euro cents. Before the crisis began in 2010, Eurobank shares traded as high as [euro]60. The other investors allied with Mr. Ross include Fairfax Financial Holdings in Toronto, whose founder and chief executive, Prem Watsa, is known as the Warren E. Buffett of Canada. The private equity firm Mr. Ross oversees, WL Ross & Company, invested [euro]37.5 million of its own money. He and the other investors poured their money into Greece at a time when the country was beginning to show signs of finally returning to growth after a long, deep slump and two international bailouts. But since January, when Mr. Tsipras's government came to power, promising to relieve Greece of the austerity engendered by those bailout programs, the economy has lapsed back into recession and depositors have been pulling money from the banks. Given Mr. Ross's record of profiting from badly damaged assets, though, it would be wrong to discount his chances of making a killing this time. In 2011, investors led by Ross & Company invested [euro]1.1 billion in Bank of Ireland, a commercial bank, when the country was in the depths of a banking crisis and recession caused by a housing bubble. But Ireland, and the bank, bounced back. Mr. Ross's firm and the other investors, including some of the same people who have invested in Eurobank, sold their shares last year for three times what they paid. It is too soon to know whether Mr. Ross's investment will pay off in the Bank of Cyprus, where he and co-investors own an 18 percent stake. But the economy of Cyprus is recovering from the crisis that nearly destroyed the banking system in 2013. And in April, the country's Parliament passed a law that would streamline the country's tortuous foreclosure process and make it easier for banks to collect from delinquent borrowers. The new law will allow banks to restructure problem loans, which amount to more than half of the total. Greece is arguably the toughest case of all. At least on paper, the four largest commercial banks in Greece -- National Bank of Greece, Piraeus Bank, Eurobank and Alpha Bank, none of whose officials were willing to comment -- are solvent. They all passed tests of their financial health conducted late last year by the European Central Bank. But they passed in part by using a legal but dubious accounting method, in which they counted anticipated tax breaks as capital. That practice, allowed in several other eurozone countries as well, is being phased out by regulators and is considered especially risky in Greece, because a bankrupt government would probably not be able to pay refunds due to taxpayers. ""This accounting option has long been viewed with a great deal of skepticism in many quarters,"" Andreas Dombret, who is responsible for bank supervision at the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said in an email. ""It is a particularly dicey thing to do when the sovereign is struggling financially like in Greece."" Problems at the Greek banks began mounting in the prelude to the election of the left-wing Syriza government in January and have continued ever since. Depositors fearful that Greece would drop out of the euro shipped [euro]30 billion abroad or squirreled it away in their homes from the end of November to the end of April. The government contributed to the deposit outflow when it raided the bank accounts of state entities to meet its basic financial obligations. The banks have been surviving on a drip feed of emergency cash from the European Central Bank. But the central bank would be forced under its rules to cut off the funding if Greece could not reach an accord with its creditors. If there is no agreement between Athens and the creditors, the consequences would be dire and unpredictable. People who have not already sent their money abroad or hidden it under a mattress might storm the A.T.M.s. Desperate to stop the flight of wealth abroad, the government would impose restrictions on money transfers, so-called capital controls. In the worst case, Greece would drop out of the euro; remaining loans and deposits would be forcibly converted into newly printed drachmas which, according to some estimates, would immediately lose about half their value against the euro. If the government defaulted on its debt, Greek banks would suffer disproportionately because they own tens of billions of euros worth of Greek bonds. The country and the banks might then go down together in a fatal embrace of mutual dependency. In other countries that have gone bankrupt, ""when banks failed, so did the economy,"" said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., who has advised Latin American countries with debt problems. But Mr. Ross argues that the situation in Greece could take a swift turn for the better if the brinkmanship on display between Athens and the creditors ends in a credible deal that restores the confidence of foreign investors. Greek banks could regain access to international money markets. Their world would start to turn again. And Mr. Ross would look very smart. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has already hinted that Greece could benefit from his bank's stimulus measures if Athens makes a deal. Mr. Ross predicts that, too. ""If there is a negotiated settlement quickly, two things will happen,"" he said. ""I think the E.C.B. will be very supportive and restore liquidity to the banks. Two, it wouldn't take very long at all for the banks and private sector to regain access to the capital markets."" Michalis Massourakis, chief economist at the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, a Greek business trade group, said that international investors needed to be convinced that any agreement would bring lasting stability, rather than just postponing the day of reckoning. ""Greece is not a basket case,"" Mr. Massourakis said. ""It is only the political situation that is causing this terrible situation.""

486,2596221328.xml,"Germany once set an example for how to manage the coronavirus. Now, deep pockets of vaccine resistance are helping drive daily infections to new heights.BERLIN -- The University Hospital of Giessen, one of Germany's foremost clinics for pulmonary disease, is at capacity. The number of Covid-19 patients has tripled in recent weeks. Nearly half of them are on ventilators.And every single one is unvaccinated.""I ask every patient: Why didn't you get vaccinated?"" said Dr. Susanne Herold, head of infectious diseases, after her daily round on the ward on Thursday. ""It's a mix of people who distrust the vaccine, distrust the state and are often difficult to reach by public information campaigns.""Patients like hers are the main drivers of a fourth wave of Covid-19 cases in Germany that has produced tens of thousands of new daily infections -- more than the country has had at any point in the pandemic.For Germany it is a startling turnabout. At the onset of the pandemic, Germany had set an example for how to manage the virus and keep the death toll low. It was quick to put in place widespread testing and treatment, expand the number of intensive care beds and had a trusted leader in Chancellor Angela Merkel, a trained scientist, whose government's social distancing guidelines were widely observed.But today, a combination of factors has propelled a new surge, among them wintry temperatures, a slow rollout of booster vaccines, and an even more pronounced spike in infections in neighboring eastern European nations like the Czech Republic. The fact that Germany is in a kind of political limbo as it transitions between governments has not helped.But virologists and pandemic experts say there is little doubt that it is the unvaccinated who are contributing most to the wave of infections burdening in hospitals across the country.""It's our low rate of vaccination -- we haven't done what was necessary,"" said Dr. Herold in Giessen. She was part of a team of scientists who modeled the impact of a fourth wave and warned in early summer that with the hyper contagious Delta variant at least 85 percent of the whole population would need to be vaccinated to avert a crisis in the health care system.""We are still below 70 percent,"" she said. ""I don't know how we can win this race against time with the fourth wave. I fear we've already lost.""Germany's vaccination rate is far better than that of many central and eastern European countries, where the death toll from coronavirus is soaring. In Romania, for example, only about four in 10 people have had two shots, and coronavirus deaths have hit record levels.Still, with about one in three Germans not yet fully vaccinated, the German vaccination rate is among the lowest in Western Europe. In Belgium, Denmark and Italy three in four people are fully vaccinated. In Spain and Iceland, only about two in 10 have yet to get the second shot. Portugal has a vaccination rate of close to 90 percent.The German rate lags because of pockets of vaccine resistance that are not limited to, but especially deep, in the former Communist east, where the far-right Alternative for Germany party is strong.  Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, leaders of the AfD's parliamentary group, are both proudly unvaccinated -- and both tested positive for the virus in recent weeks.""What we are experiencing is above all a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" the minister of health, Jens Spahn, said earlier this month.Infections have also spiked in parts of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, two wealthy southern states that are home to a noisy protest movement against  measures to combat the virus, known as the ""Querdenker,""  or ""contrarians.""""We have two viruses in the country,"" Markus Söder, the Bavarian governor, said in a television debate recently. ""We have coronavirus and we have this poison, which is being spread on a massive scale,"" he said referring to misinformation about vaccines.Klaus-Peter Hanke knows about that poisonous propaganda firsthand.He is the mayor of Pirna, a town of less than 40,000 in the eastern state of Saxony, which experienced a wave of violent protests from anti-vaxxers in the final days of the lockdown last spring.One in three voters in the voting district that includes Pirna cast their ballots for the AfD in September's national election. And just under half of inhabitants refuse to get vaccinated. They have helped to make Saxony the state with the lowest vaccination rate in Germany -- and with the highest per capita number of new infections.""The readiness to get vaccinated is low here,"" Mr. Hanke said in an interview. ""We tried to counter that with dialogue. But there is a point where you hit a wall, and you just can't get any further and one result is that it has escalated.""The Covid ward at the hospital is running out of beds. There, too, almost all patients are unvaccinated, Mr. Hanke said: ""Nine out 10.""And still, several restaurants in town have signs in the window, inviting ""everyone"" -- not just those vaccinated or recovered from an infection as per state rules -- to come inside.There are now 10 control teams of three people each -- a police officer a health official and someone from the department of public order -- who roam the city's restaurants, bars and hairdressers and fine those disregarding the rules on the spot: Owners have to pay 500 euros, about $572, patrons 150 euros, $170.""It's pretty drastic,"" said Mr. Hanke, who has vaccine resisters in his own circle of friends. ""But we see no other way to get people to change their behavior.""Anecdotally at least, the tough approach might be paying off. Waiting times at mobile vaccination units increased to two hours this week, Mr. Hanke reported, suggesting that the threat of exclusion from much of indoor public life might be nudging more people to get a shot.Several other German states are now working on similar regulations, introducing stricter mask mandates and instead of a negative test, making proof of vaccination or past infection mandatory for entry to many venues.That may no longer be enough, said Sandra Ciesek, director of the Institute of Medical Virology at the University Hospital of Frankfurt and cosignatory of a paper by seven prominent scientists published last week, in which they urge politicians to speed up booster shots and consider a range of measures, including partial lockdowns for the unvaccinated or even a short-term national lockdown.The absence of political leadership at the national level at a time when the number of new daily infections is soaring beyond 50,000 has added to the muddled approach to containing the virus.Since her conservative party lost the national election in September, Ms. Merkel remains only as the head of a caretaker government while her likely successor, Olaf Scholz, has been absorbed by difficult coalition talks with two other parties.""Where is Angela Merkel?"" Der Spiegel asked in an article this week, before asking a few paragraphs lower: ""Where is Scholz?""It is a question many virologists across the country are asking, too, concerned that a lack of political leadership is wasting valuable time -- and potentially costing lives.""There is no real center of power and responsibility: The country is missing leadership,"" said Michael Meyer-Hermann, head of the department of Systems Immunology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research and a member of the council of experts that has advised Ms. Merkel throughout the pandemic.""The outgoing government no longer really reacts, and the incoming government is playing everything down,"" he added.After the number of daily new coronavirus infections hit a record high on Nov. 3, reaching 33,949, German virologists sounded the alarm. The response from Mr. Scholz's future coalition partners was a statement promising that there would not be another lockdown.""For me it was a key moment,"" Professor Meyer-Hermann said. ""They act like the pandemic is over at a time when the numbers are exploding.""Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Christopher F.

2486,1152077037.xml,"       PARIS -- Demonstrators surrounded a German diplomat in Salonika in northern Greece on Thursday and hurled coffee and bottles of water at him, another reflection of growing anger in Greece against what is widely seen as a crippling austerity plan being imposed largely by Germany. The incident involving the diplomat, Wolfgang Hoelscher-Obermaier, flared a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel's special envoy to Greece, Hans-Joachim Fuchtel, said studies showed that 1,000 German local government officials could do the work of 3,000 Greek officials. His remarks, which came as European leaders dallied again over how to finance the debt-racked country, infuriated Greeks in Salonika who had been on strike and had occupied the town hall to protest a $17 billion austerity bill that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's government approved last week. Greece had to pass the measure in order to receive $40 billion in aid that it needs to avoid bankruptcy. On Thursday, Mr. Fuchtel said his comments were not directed at Greek officials. ""I have met many industrious Greek civil servants,"" he said. ""My point was about making the administration more effective, with fewer levels of decision making."" But in a country with unemployment nearing 30 percent, and where the austerity measures passed last week were equivalent to 9 percent of the country's economic output, Mr. Fuchtel's comments were seen as tone deaf. Early reports that protesters had stormed a meeting in Salonika that included the diplomat, Mr. Hoelscher-Obermaier, were incorrect, Mr. Fuchtel said, adding that the only disruption came when coffee was thrown on Mr. Hoelscher-Obermaier. But Greeks were still riled by Mr. Fuchtel's remarks. He ""cannot understand exactly how serious is the problem, the social deterioration in Greece,"" said Nikos Xydakis, a columnist for Kathimerini, a daily newspaper. ""I don't know if he understands how the unemployment rates are translated in human lives,"" he said, adding that Mr. Fuchtel lacked ""the flexibility and the diplomatic skills"" to speak more carefully. The Greek-German tensions broke open a day after coordinated strikes in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. That effort, and the deep divisions among Greece's foreign lenders over how best to resolve the country's debt problems, have tapped into a growing sense across Southern Europe that the social order is unraveling faster than European leaders are acting to preserve it. Mr. Fuchtel's task was to assist Greek municipalities in setting up strategic partnerships with German towns and cities to help them become more efficient. He has been received warmly by officials but less so by a wary public. European officials this week delayed a decision on releasing the $40 billion aid installment, saying they needed more time to assess if Greece was adhering to reforms promised in exchange for two bailout packages totaling more than $300 billion. Greece's European partners are likely to send billions in aid anyway by the end of November to avoid the threat of a default and the trouble it could stir up, both in bond markets and on Greece's streets. Meanwhile, Germany's economy continued to defy the recession that is gripping the euro zone, growing 0.2 percent in the third quarter even as the Greek economy continued to collapse.  That growth is drawing thousands of migrants. According to statistics released Thursday, half a million people moved to Germany in just the first six months of 2012, with an especially sharp rise in the number of people moving there from crisis-stricken countries in Southern Europe. An additional 6,900 people came from Greece, an increase of 78 percent over the first half of 2011, along with an additional 3,900 from Spain, a 53 percent increase, and 2,000 more from Portugal, also a 53 percent increase. The absolute numbers are not that large, but the increase in migration to Germany's relatively robust economy could stoke fears of a brain drain in the euro zone. German companies have been trying to recruit for professions from engineering to health care as more people leave the country's rapidly aging work force.

327,864923686.xml,"      PARIS -- No European government has condemned or criticized the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos, but the questions raised about the changing details of his death sharpened considerably after the White House revealed that he did not fire a weapon, was not armed and did not use a woman as a protective shield.   Some are questioning whether ""justice"" in fact was done, as President Obamaportrayed the killing, and whether the American troops made any effort to capture Bin Laden alive or whether they simply executed him. And some think that the scenes of celebrating Americans -- whether at the White House or at ground zero -- are inappropriate responses that are indecorous at the least and at worst could incite more terrorism.   The disquiet is mostly among those on the left and among the elite in the news media, but it is reminiscent of the atmosphere during the Bush administration and the war against Iraq, when the United States was criticized for unilateralism, arrogance, disrespect for international law, triumphalism and a resort to overwhelming military force.   ""We're back, not to square one, but perhaps square four in anti-Americanism,"" said Nicole Bacharan, a scholar of the United States at the Institute of Political Studies, or Sciences Po, in Paris. ""Whatever happens, we need to prove we are different or better, that we are so much more refined and delicate and have such a respect for the law,"" she said, characterizing the European stance. ""It's very silly.""    The reaction is limited, Ms. Bacharan said, adding that she believed that most Europeans and French were ""glad he's gone.""   ""I think it's a small world of journalists and political elites who are not quite sure they should be happy,"" she said.   But as a sign of the sensitivity -- which also goes to the heart of European concerns about the war in Afghanistan and terrorism sponsored by Al Qaeda in Europe itself -- the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, found herself on the defensive when she said on Monday that she was ""glad that it was successful, the killing of Bin Laden.""    Her comments were heavily criticized. A member of her own conservative Christian Democratic Union, Siegfried Kauder, said: ""I wouldn't have used those words. That is a vengeful way of thinking that one shouldn't have; that's medieval."" And her foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle of the Free Democrats, called on Wednesday for the West to temper its responses, to avoid undue celebration ""that could again lead to incitement or the heroization of Al Qaeda.""   At the same time, in comments to the newspaper Die Welt, he said that the death of Bin Laden was ""good news for the entire world,"" and that ""it is understandable to have a feeling of relief that this terrorist who had thousands of victims on his conscience cannot continue to spread his terror."" So long, apparently, as the relief is kept under control.   Nicolas Demorand, editor of the left-leaning French daily Liberation, on Tuesday bemoaned the ""toxic rhetoric"" of the campaign against terrorism. From that rhetoric, he wrote, stems ""this base, uncomfortable joy, unprecedented in a democracy, that blew yesterday over the streets of New York.""   Even the editor of the centrist weekly L'Express, Christophe Barbier, cautioned, ""To victory one must not add provocation."" He added: ""To desecrate the cadaver or the memory of Bin Laden is to revive him. To cry one's joy in the streets of our cities is to ape the turbaned barbarians who danced the night of Sept. 11. It is to tell them the ghastly competition continues between them and us.""   But Le Monde praised Mr. Obama for his sober speech Sunday night, contrasting it with that of President George W. Bush in 2003, who dressed as a fighter pilot to land on an aircraft carrier and declare the end of combat operations in Iraq, with a banner carrying his ""ridiculous 'Mission Accomplished.' ""   The Dutch foreign minister, Uri Rosenthal, said in a statement: ""It would have been better if Bin Laden had been captured alive and forced to answer for his deeds in a court of law. Nevertheless, this is a historic event.""   For Justin Vaisse, a French political scientist who is director of research for the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, the different reactions to the rejoicing ""simply reflects the difference in experiences, which you could also see in 2001 and 2002.""    ""Nine-eleven happened there, not here. Europeans don't understand why people would rejoice at ground zero, while it seems relatively easy to understand that in the United States.""   Leah Pisar, who worked at the White House during the Clinton years and wrote a book in French about French-American relations during the Iraq war, ""Orage sur l'Atlantique,"" or ""Storm Over the Atlantic,"" said that underlying the disquiet was Europe's concern about Qaeda retaliation.   ""It's partly the fear of upsetting the Muslim community at home,"" she said, adding, ""there is an angst everyone is sharing over where Al Qaeda will hit back.""    Many European nations remain on a high state of alert after warnings last year that groups of European Muslims, especially Germans, had received training in Qaeda camps in Pakistan and had been sent back to Europe to commit ""Mumbai-style"" attacks on civilians. Some were killed and captured, but government officials say that the threat continues.   Ms. Pisar said that France was also worried about French hostages being held by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the network's North African branch, ""and how this plays into the Arab Spring.""   She also noted that the tone of French foreign policy, under the Gaullist foreign minister, Alain Juppe, who opposed France's full integration into NATO, has shifted away from the pro-Americanism of his predecessor, Bernard Kouchner.    Ms. Bacharan, who is working on a book on 9/11, agreed, saying that Mr. Kouchner ""had a very hard time imposing that view on the Quai d'Orsay, and people were waiting for him to be gone."" Mr. Juppe, she said, spent his career in the Gaullist line of Jacques Chirac and Dominique de Villepin, who made opposition to United States positions a kind of cornerstone of French policy.   Mr. Vaisse, however, noted that the criticism might have been slightly muted by the Libyan operation. ""There, our planes are bombing Libya and tried to kill Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and missed,"" he said.   Mr. Obama has also brought about a tonal shift, he said, noting, ""A couple of years ago, under the Bush administration, the reactions would have been ballistic, and far more pointed.""   There are also questions in Europe over whether the killing of Bin Laden was legal.   A columnist at the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, Heribert Prantl, asked, ""Which law governs the execution of Bin Laden?"" He said that American law required trials before the death penalty and concluded, ""The decision to kill the godfather of terror was political.""   Geoffrey Robertson, a prominent human rights lawyer in Britain who is currently defending the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, was scathing in an interview on the BBC. Mr. Obama's assertion that justice was done was ""a total misuse of language,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""This is the justice of the Red Queen: sentence first, trial later.""   If it were clear that Bin Laden was ""threatening to use a weapon to kill,"" then his shooting is justifiable as self-defense, Mr. Robertson conceded. But if the order was to kill Bin Laden, he said, that would be illegal. And depriving Bin Laden of a trial leaves him ""now as a martyr,"" he said. ""By killing him, you have ironically given him the death he most desired, a fast track to paradise. I think he died with a smile on his lips.""   Ms. Pisar said there was a double standard at work. ""What was the legal basis for decapitating Daniel Pearl?"" she asked, referring to the Wall Street Journal reporter kidnapped and killed by Al Qaeda in Pakistan in 2002.   European skepticism stems from the history of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, she noted. ""But that's what makes the democracy so strong,"" she said. ""It's good that we can ask these questions, and the president has to go out there and be accountable.""   Mr. Vaisse, like many Europeans, believes that the commandos had orders to kill Bin Laden. ""That's my one real doubt,"" he said. ""I think they had orders to shoot, quite frankly. It's so complicated to deal with a living Osama bin Laden. I guess that's my own conspiracy theory.""

551,1917257260.xml,"HAMBURG, Germany -- The Europeans have stopped trying to paper over their differences with President Trump and the United States.Traditionally respectful of American leadership and mindful of the country's crucial role in European defense and global trade, European leaders normally repress or soften their criticism of United States presidents. Europeans were generally not happy with President Barack Obama's reluctance to involve the country in Libya and Syria, for example, or his tardiness to engage in what became an international confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, but their criticism was quiet.
But here at the Group of 20 summit meeting, public splits with Mr. Trump were the order of the day. Those rifts have been reflected in European domestic politics, too, from Britain and France to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that Europe must ""take our fate into our own hands"" and stop ""glossing over"" clear differences.
The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose election has renewed confidence among Europeans, said bluntly: ""Our world has never been so divided. Centrifugal forces have never been so powerful. Our common goods have never been so threatened.""
Mr. Macron, who waved his iPhone around during the meeting as a symbol of global trade, sharply criticized those like Mr. Trump who do not support multilateral institutions but push nationalism instead.
""We need better coordination, more coordination,"" Mr. Macron said. ""We need those organizations that were created out of the Second World War. Otherwise, we will be moving back toward narrow-minded nationalism.""
Mr. Trump and the British vote to leave the European Union ""have proved to be great unifiers for the European Union,"" said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""There is a renewed sense of confidence in Europe after the French election,"" the apparent retreat of populism, an increase in economic growth and the prospect of Ms. Merkel's re-election in September, he said.
""There is an increased willingness to be assertive toward Trump, who makes Merkel look like a figure of international importance,"" Mr. Leonard said. ""If the election is about who can save the international world order from Trump,"" he added, then Ms. Merkel's opposition seems unimportant and she finds an eager partner in Mr. Macron. ""They egg each other on and feel more self-confident together and help keep Europe together, too.""
Jan Techau, the director of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin, said: ""There is now a more openly confrontational language with the United States. The European public is already outspoken about Trump, but now there is a more outspoken European leadership that won't paper over these divisions anymore.""
If Europeans had previously felt constrained, Mr. Techau said, there is now a feeling that ""Trump has no constraints and will say anything, and now the Europeans feel they can do the same."" And, he said, ""that means less respect for each other, and less mutual confidence.""
François Heisbourg, a French security analyst, agreed. ""The reticence has gone away,"" he said. ""On an issue-by-issue basis, there is apparently no penalty for playing hardball with Trump without necessarily affecting security, on climate for example.""
The strains were most visible here on climate policy and trade. Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris accord was widely condemned, and all the leaders aside from Mr. Trump signed up to language that called the agreement ""irreversible.""
""Whatever leadership is,"" said one senior French diplomat, who was not authorized to speak by name and insisted on anonymity, ""it is not being outvoted, 19 to 1.""
The climate debate in the meeting displayed how hard it is to isolate the world's richest, most powerful country.
The Americans did try to persuade some countries, like Turkey and Poland, which Mr. Trump visited just before going to Hamburg, to move toward the American position on climate, but they were rebuffed. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said later that his country might still be in play, depending on money. The American withdrawal, he said, jeopardized compensation for developing countries to cope with compliance.
Australia and Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Trump has wooed, were also leaning toward adopting part of the American position in the final communiqué, especially on ""working closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently,"" European officials said.
One negotiator familiar with the talks said some countries had expressed interest in supporting that American language. Sarah Ladislaw, the director of the energy and security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted that a number of fossil fuel countries that want to continue to export more efficient coal and gas technologies might be relieved to see the change in tune
""There is likely a lot of pent-up sentiment that knows it's probably not the polite thing to say, but they're really pleased the U.S. is saying it,"" Ms. Ladislaw said.
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain also tried to balance Mr. Trump's deep unpopularity in Britain with her need for American support for the country's exit from the European Union and for future trade deals. She was criticized for not making the climate issue one of her four priorities here, and found comfort in Mr. Trump's promise of a ""very powerful"" trade deal for a post-""Brexit"" Britain that could be completed ""very, very quickly.""
Mrs. May even expressed the hope that Mr. Trump might change his mind on the Paris accord, though Ms. Merkel did not agree. And in the end, all wavering members sided with the 19, not the one.
The White House saw progress nonetheless. ""The vast majority of the G-20 supports the president's vision for universal access to affordable and reliable energy, including finding ways to burn fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently,"" said George David Banks, a special assistant to the president on international energy and environment and lead negotiator for climate change during the G-20 conference.
On trade, there was more effort to find compromise, with previous G-20 positions for free trade and against protectionism watered down to secure American support. The communiqué cited, for the first time, the right of countries to protect their markets with ""legitimate trade defense instruments"" -- wording that essentially gives Mr. Trump room to pursue his ""America first"" policy on issues like steel imports, where Washington is talking about restrictions based on ""national security.""
The group agreed to accelerate work on a global review of steel production and sales, though any sanctions must meet the standards of the World Trade Organization.
In a general way, such open disagreements can undermine future coherence in times of crisis, Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics and trade at Cornell University, wrote in an email.
""Trump has put the rest of the G-20 in a largely defensive mode,"" he said, as they try to limit the damage on issues like globalization, multilateralism and climate. But ""it comes at a cost of eroding U.S. leadership,"" he said. ""If even in calm times such rifts are exposed, it could make it more complicated for the group to work together in more complicated circumstances.""
Yet politics also matter. The Europeans are determined to punish Mr. Trump for abandoning the Paris accord as a matter of ""diplomatic dignity,"" said Paul Bledsoe, who was an aide to President Bill Clinton on climate change.
""Because European leaders pleaded with Trump to stay and he rebuked them so directly,"" Mr. Bledsoe said, ""I think they're determined to show the administration there's going to be a price to pay, even if it's not entirely in Europe's own interest.""

3789,1655238914.xml,"       LUHANSKOYE, Ukraine --  The first day of a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine was marred by deadly artillery fire on Sunday, and both the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists accused each other of violating the new accord. Some lingering violence was expected, given the recent intensity of the combat, yet over all, Ukrainian officials said, the accord reached last week was holding. A lull after the midnight cease-fire deadline, however, was followed Sunday morning by a resumption of shelling near the disputed town of Debaltseve, where the fate of about 8,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained unresolved in the negotiations leading to the cease-fire. By midday, shells and rockets were flying in both directions over the front line about nine miles north of the besieged town. The separatists had violated the cease-fire 10 times at various locations, a Ukrainian military spokesman, Anatoliy Stelmakh, said in a statement on Sunday. A local official said two people had died in shelling. The separatists said the Ukrainian Army had opened fire and their forces had little choice but to respond, a rebel news agency, DAN, quoted Eduard Basurin, the military spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic, as saying. ""Units were forced to open fire in response,"" Mr. Basurin said. The clashes focused, as they have for weeks, on Ukraine's fragile, attenuated and possibly severed supply route into Debaltseve. A rebel leader had warned on Saturday that the accord would not apply to that area, if the Ukrainian Army tried to break out of what he said was an encirclement. The Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, has denied that Debaltseve is surrounded. The argument hinges on one section of road stretching about nine miles from this village, Luhanskoye, into Debaltseve. It is heavily mined and within range of both armies' artillery, meaning that neither side can travel it and that neither the separatists nor Kiev can claim undisputed control over it. If Ukraine cannot evacuate or resupply the thousands of soldiers there, the casualties, from artillery barrages, and the eventual surrender of the survivors, could tip the outcome of the war, and quite likely destabilize Ukrainian domestic politics. Mr. Poroshenko has said he may ask Parliament to declare martial law. A dozen or so soldiers, filthy, bearded and wide-eyed, turned up on Sunday at a hospital in Ukrainian-held territory after escaping from the town. They said that comrades in another truck had been blown up by a separatist missile. They were the first known people to have left Debaltseve since Thursday, though their exit seemed to shed no light on the dispute over the openness of the road. After unloading three wounded colleagues and a body, one of the soldiers, who offered only his first name, Viktor, slumped in a hospital corridor and said, ""We got out only because we were lucky."" Soldiers on the supply route have said for days that it was impassable, contrary to the senior leadership's claims. From the last Ukrainian checkpoint here in Luhanskoye, the road stretched off into the mist Sunday morning, cratered and vacant, with nothing moving in either direction. ""You should leave here as quickly as you can,"" a twitchy Ukrainian soldier said. ""This road is closed."" Kommersant, an influential Russian newspaper, reported over the weekend that eight of the 16 hours of cease-fire talks involving the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, last week circled around the fate of Debaltseve. ""Almost half of the time was spent discussing the Debaltseve kettle,"" wrote the newspaper's Kremlin reporter, Andrey Kolesnikov, using the Russian term for a military encirclement. ""Above all, does it exist or not?"" he wrote. ""Vladimir Putin insisted that it exists and that if a cease-fire agreement is reached, it will be odd if it isn't violated: Those in the kettle will certainly try to get out of there; those who have boiled that kettle will try to collect the foam."" Over the weekend, President Obama spoke by telephone with Mr. Poroshenko and expressed ""grave concern"" about the Debaltseve problem. Mr. Obama also spoke with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. President François Hollande of France and Ms. Merkel also spoke by phone to Mr. Poroshenko and the Russian president, Mr. Putin, about the truce, according to a statement issued by Mr. Hollande's office. On the first day of the cease-fire, many people began stirring from bunkers and basements and assessing the damage. In Luhanskoye, soldiers stood outside, smoking against a backdrop of destruction -- discarded ammunition boxes, broken tree limbs and shattered glass. Not a single house had its windows intact. Illustrating how poorly the army was equipped, one soldier was using the lull to repair a battery for his armored personnel carrier, saying he had no spare. Kneeling in a muddy street, he melted a piece of plastic with a cigarette lighter and allowed the blobs to plug a leak in the wall of the battery. A lone pedestrian picked his way through craters on a street, carrying a bag of bread that he said he would feed to his chickens that had not been cared for since Thursday. He was not sure how many had made it. ""It's not a big deal,"" he said. ""But I do want to keep them."" Despite the continued shelling, some residents in these front-line villages said they were focused on the benefits the deal had already brought. Aleksei V. Kravchenko, 73, a retiree in Svitlodarsk, watched plumbers repair a water pipe burst in an artillery strike on Saturday, before the cease-fire took effect. He said he wanted to thank Ms. Merkel for negotiating the truce, despite its limitations, on behalf of his grandchildren. Mr. Kravchenko had built a bomb shelter in his basement and had spent nights with the children during the shelling. ""They would say, 'Grandpa, I don't want to die young,' and I held them, and they were shaking, and I looked in their eyes, and they were afraid,"" he said. ""Now we are hoping.""

62,1540038429.xml,"       DONETSK, Ukraine --  The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany on Wednesday called for extending the truce between government and rebel troops in eastern Ukraine, even as separatist leaders said that the peace process had collapsed. Faced with the threat of additional economic sanctions from Washington, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia discussed an extension of the cease-fire, which is to expire on Friday, in a telephone call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President François Hollande of France and Ukraine's new president, Petro O. Poroshenko.  He said Russia had made a commitment to ease the conflict by revoking an order that provided for the use of the Russian Army in Ukraine. Surprise talks between separatist leaders and representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian governments, as well as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, on Monday offered the first hope for a settlement in the conflict, which has left more than 420 people dead since mid-April, according to the United Nations. Yet on Tuesday, one day after the cease-fire was declared, rebel forces in the city of Slovyansk shot down a Ukrainian Army helicopter with a surface-to-air missile, killing nine servicemen. Aleksandr Borodai, a separatist leader from Russia, said that fighting had resumed almost immediately after the temporary truce was announced Monday. ""There was no peace, and the cease-fire is not being observed,"" said Mr. Borodai, the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, adding that the agreement was violated first by government troops. No further talks with Kiev were planned, he said. ""I don't see the possibility for us to continue the discussion,"" Mr. Borodai said, adding that the achievements of the negotiators ""had no practical meaning."" Mr. Borodai also confirmed that the rebels had acquired heavier arms and artillery, including tanks and howitzers, which he said had been captured from the Ukrainian military. He did not say how many tanks the rebels had. Ukraine and the United States have accused Russia of arming the rebel forces. On Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry began a news conference at NATO in Brussels by calling for Mr. Putin ""to stop the flow of weapons and fighters across the border."" Mr. Kerry said that the missile launcher that brought down the helicopter on Tuesday was Russian-made and urged Mr. Putin to call for separatist forces to lay down their arms. A senior administration official said Friday that several tanks under rebel possession had come from Russia. The Obama administration has drawn up plans to escalate sanctions against Russia if it does not back the current peace plan by halting the flow of weapons and fighters across the Russian border. The sanctions could target some of Russia's largest banks, or energy and defense firms. The Kremlin on Wednesday said that during the phone call with Mr. Putin and the other leaders, ""confidence was expressed"" that the vote in the upper house of Parliament to rescind an authorization to use Russian troops in Ukraine would ""help de-escalate the situation."" The vote by the Federation Council, which took place on Wednesday, was largely symbolic, because Mr. Putin could order urgent military action at his discretion and because the Parliament would very likely restore authority at his request.  The Federation Council voted 153 to 1 to cancel its resolution of March 1 allowing Mr. Putin to send Russian troops to Ukraine. Mr. Poroshenko called the vote ""a positive signal,"" but called on Russia for ""tangible actions,"" according to a statement released by his office. Mr. Poroshenko's office emphasized a different part of the phone call, noting that he had told his counterparts of 52 cases of violations of the cease-fire by militants in east Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of 18 people since June 20. In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Poroshenko hinted at the controversy that the talks in Donetsk had caused. Previously, Mr. Poroshenko's administration had said he would not speak with ""terrorists,"" a term often used by the government for the separatists. ""I know that the fact of such consultations has been perceived controversially by the public,"" Mr. Poroshenko said. ""The so-called hawks demand rapid and severe military actions. Others demand large-scale compromises to avoid war. I will answer both parties: Our goal is not war."" ""Our goal is peace,"" he continued. ""But I would like to emphasize: peace not for any price and under any conditions."" Credit: ANDREW ROTH and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Andrew Roth reported from Donetsk, and David M.

1941,1437283676.xml,"       BERLIN -- In the first step of what could be a long road to building a new German government, the defeated Social Democrats agreed on Friday to enter into talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives over a possible coalition, naming fair wages, good jobs and a strengthening of the country's social system as key points. Recent surveys have shown that a majority of Germans would like to see a ""grand coalition"" government between the country's two main parties, traditionally political rivals. But in the wake of Sunday's national elections, when the center-left Social Democrats had their second-worst showing since the end of World War II, many in the party are more concerned with building up a profile in opposition to Ms. Merkel's conservatives, having become wary of the potential political cost of entering a coalition that could make them appear to be too close to the chancellor. ""We are in an extremely difficult situation,"" Stephan Weil, a Social Democrat who is the governor of the state of Lower Saxony, told the ARD public broadcasting network ahead of the talks, which began Friday night. ""We need to agree on a course for the Social Democrats in the coming years, and that will involve a lot of wrangling tonight, but I expect there will be a clear decision."" The 200 delegates who met Friday evening agreed that a handful of leaders could meet with representatives from the Christian Democrats to sound out common points. If enough are found, delegates will meet again to vote on whether to proceed with formal coalition negotiations. Delegates agreed that issues addressed in the Social Democrats' campaign platform must be address in negotiations. They include passage of a national minimum wage, repealing an unpopular family subsidy for young children who are cared for at home and an increase in some taxes for those in the highest earning bracket. ""Now it is up to Ms. Merkel to begin working on building a government,"" Sigmar Gabriel, the party chairman, said after the meeting. Delegates further agreed that all 447,000 members of the party would vote on a possible coalition agreement. While Social Democrat leaders said the move would ensure ""a high level of transparency democracy within the party,"" some experts saw it as a high-stakes move with possible far-reaching consequences. ""It would be very risky,"" said Timo Grunden, a political scientist at the University of Giessen. If the members vote to seek a coalition, it increases the pressure on Ms. Merkel's party, he said. But if they vote a leadership proposal down, he said, new national elections would be required, presumably along with new party leadership. A new round of balloting could shift the current outcome, in which Ms. Merkel's conservative bloc, made up of her own Christian Democratic Union and a sister party, the Christian Social Union, emerged the clear winner, even though they came up five seats short of an absolute majority. Their partners in government for the past four years, the Free Democrats, failed to win enough votes to remain in Parliament, leaving the chancellor looking for a new party willing to enter into a coalition. The other option for Ms. Merkel, the left-leaning Greens party, won only 8.4 percent of the vote, setting off a crisis in its leadership and leaving it in a weakened position to enter into talks with the conservatives. Coalition-building can be an arduous process, all the more so when those involved are accustomed to opposing one another over key issues. When the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats had to work out an agreement in 2005, it took until the end of November for a government to be formed. The Social Democrats have largely supported the chancellor's policy on the euro, despite hopes from Germany's partners in Europe that their inclusion in a new government might result in a softening of Ms. Merkel's position toward weaker members of the euro zone. Her initial comments on Monday gave no indication of any such intentions, insisting that European policy would continue ""in the same spirit as before.""

2985,1894821654.xml,"CORRECTION APPENDED. With clothing, Marine Le Pen casts herself as the mother of France, Ms. Friedman writes:
On Wednesday, when the far-right presidential candidate of France Marine Le Pen took the stage in the circular television studio in La Plaine Saint-Denis north of Paris for a potentially decisive debate against her centrist rival, Emmanuel Macron, she did so in a neat navy jacket, collarless V-neck white blouse, pegged trousers and spiky heels. Her makeup was soft, her signature blond flip gently curled at the edges. The classic C-suite palette telegraphed a pulled-together professionalism (she almost matched with Mr. Macron), the shoes suggested an unapologetic femininity and the hair added a motherly halo.
For the country glued to the TV, it made for a strategic statement, even before she said a word.
And it underscored the point made by Samir Hammal, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po (the Paris Institute of Political Studies), who said that while ""our male presidents have traditionally cast themselves as the fathers of the nation, she has cast herself as the mother."" To this end, she has been a master at dressing the part.
After all, one of the things the 48-year-old lawyer and mother understood from the very beginning of her political career was just how large a role her own style could play in reshaping perception, not just of herself and her family, but of their party itself. Whatever you think of her politics, and the broader implications of her rise and that of the far right in Europe, that she has gotten so far means it is important to consider the way she has gone about normalizing what was once dismissed as fringe. In this, clothes have played a central role.
Just because they did so in a country where dress is not deemed an unseemly consideration for serious people, and self-expression through fashion is practically a sacrament, does not make her tactical use of her wardrobe any less resonant for us all.
Since 2011, when Ms. Le Pen took over the party her father built and moved it away from its anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic roots to make it a palpable, if uncomfortable, force in French politics, she has been deft about using her own image as a tool in separating herself from the French elites, and about making her formerly toxic party look ... well, like everybody else. Literally.
She has transformed herself, as Mr. Hammal said, from the extremist next door to the ""woman next door.""
""All past leaders, from Louis XIV to Napoleon, have used costume to create legitimacy for their power,"" Mr. Hammal said. ""But Marine Le Pen is one of the best."" She realized early on, he said, that dress could be a tool to help legitimize her party. And that as a woman, with all the greater wardrobe choice and freedom that suggests, she was the ideal person to wield it.
It began with a haircut. In 2007, when Ms. Le Pen became the director of strategy for her father's presidential campaign, she lopped off her Farrah Fawcett locks and adopted her shoulder-grazing flip, going from seductive to Doris Day with a touch of the curling iron. Like Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel, she adopted a uniform of basic pantsuits, though she alternates them with straight, above-the-knee skirts to emphasize her femininity (see her much-discussed campaign poster with its flash of thigh) and the occasional jeans and trench coat. The message was generic female executive with a patriotic color palette: red, blue and white, the tones of the tricolor, set off against black and white.
She has made something of a signature out of being unbranded, abandoning her Dior sunglasses along with the couture trappings of the patrimony that have long been embraced by the French female political establishment.
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a former finance minister, for example, is known for her Chanel jackets and Hermès bags. Rachida Dati, a former justice minister in Nicolas Sarkozy's cabinet, was shown in a Dior dress on the cover of Paris Match. And Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a former mayoral candidate in Paris, wore Dior when she attended the Céline show during her campaign. (She lost, which may have been a signal that things were changing.) Even Brigitte Macron, the wife of Mr. Macron, recently came under fire for borrowing clothes from Louis Vuitton, a practice she began when her husband was finance minister.
By contrast, Ms. Le Pen went so far as to rent a caped, halter-neck blue gown (designer: who knows?) to wear to the Time 100 gala in 2015. Though there was some head-scratching about the choice, the message was meant to resonate with her base at home, not her fellow partygoers.
Indeed, she has been adept at adopting her clothes to her constituencies: wearing a bright red jacket, navy shirt and pumps at a party rally; wrinkled black trousers and a zip-up jacket on the streets of Amiens while talking to striking factory workers.
Mr. Hammal calls this ""mirroring,"" and for a politician running on a populist ticket, claiming to feel the pain of marginalized working men and women, it has been indubitably effective.
""If you listened to the same speech coming out of the mouth of a man, it would not have the same effect,"" he said. ""But because of how she looks when she says it, how maternal she seems, it's much easier to hear.""
After all, in the encyclopedia of political tactics, makeover comes just after Machiavelli. Or, perhaps it should from now on.
Emmanuel Macron's sober suit modified as his numbers shifted, Mr. Trebay writes:
He is the teacher's pet, or chouchou, who once dressed like the big kid who literally married his high school instructor. He is an economics geek with a degree in philosophy who headed a government finance ministry while clad in the strictly-tailored power suits favored by members of the Grandes Écoles elite.
He is athletic and mediagenic, a Kennedy-style maverick, a candidate for the digital age and also one whose pretty-boy looks helped propel him onto GQ France's best-dressed list just as his pragmatic and business-friendly rhetoric carried him to the head of a field of seasoned politicians in the French elections.
He is Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate who faces off this week in the second and final round of voting for the presidency against his rival, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. As a 39-year-old political novice, Mr. Macron has repeatedly demonstrated that a lack of experience running for public office is no deterrent to an ability to manipulate image and shift shape on a dime. His clothes have been one of the many platforms he has used to convey his message to the divided population.
""His style and self-presentation reek of health, vigor and physical prowess,"" Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, a senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion and an expert on fashion semiotics, said in an email.
""The sharp suits make him look disciplined, but also energetic,"" Ms. Cronberg added, and they offer a defining visual contrast with the rumpled and often fumbling appearance of the departing president, the Socialist François Hollande.
Superficially, Mr. Macron's sober two-button suits are all but indistinguishable from those favored by most high-level French businessmen and politicians. Yet they have been modified and altered repeatedly as his poll numbers shifted and he sought to look more -- although never too baldly -- presidential.
In other words, when the dapper tailored suits the candidate wore in both his ministry days and at the start of his campaign -- invariably with a sky-blue shirt and Windsor-knotted, solid-color four-in-hand tie -- first drew attention for their obvious price tags, he promptly ditched them. ""No ordinary person wears suits that cost 1,000 euros,"" Mr. Macron's right-hand aide, Ismaël Emelien, said. ""That's too expensive.""
When his natty midnight-blue suits began attracting the perhaps unwanted attention of the French fashion news media, the candidate immediately lowered his sartorial profile and his expenses. Soon he was spotted dressed as a midprice version of his former self, clad in clothes made for him by Jean-Claude and Laurent Toubol, whose small tailoring shop in the Paris garment district has become a default outfitter of French tyro politicians, from Guillaume Larrivé, 40, a member of the French National Assembly, to Patrice Bessac, 39, the Communist mayor of Montreuil.
Other youthful politicians have faced the challenge Mr. Macron now does: to balance an image representative of the entrepreneurial France he imagines driving into a digital future and a hidebound traditional one. The open-neck shirts of Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, were an image fail. So, too, would a vision of Mr. Macron be in the hoodies and jeans favored by the tech wizards he sees as vital to a French economic future stoked by start-ups like the ride-sharing app BlaBlaCar or the niche internet retailer Vente-privee.
Still, that he elects to wear suits in almost every setting, outside the ski slopes, is both strategic and a necessity, Ms. Cronberg said. ""Those perennial dark suits,"" she explained, continue to serve an important function, despite the widespread abandonment of the suit by the wider fashion world. ""They speak of respectability and tradition and of how powerful men control others by controlling themselves.""

Putin, already a well established geopolitical star, had a splashy day on the global stage at the Group of 20 summit meeting on Friday, even by his own standards.First, Mr. Putin stirred things up in Europe by proclaiming, in an interview with the Financial Times, that the world's liberal political order had ""outlived its purpose.""Within hours, he listened cheerily through an apparent joke by President Trump about rubbing out journalists in Russia.Later, a video of Mr. Putin shaking hands with an extraordinarily glum-looking Theresa May, the British prime minister, touched off another media storm.And over the course of the summit, a gathering of officials from the world's wealthiest economies, he conducted a dozen or so meetings and found time to broker a deal with China claiming to cut out the use of dollars in bilateral trade, a longtime goal for Russia.In the interview with the Financial Times, Mr. Putin said that the ""liberal idea,"" by which he meant the postwar dominance of democracy, human rights, multiculturalism and tolerance, had become ""obsolete.""""Liberals cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,"" Mr. Putin said, according to a transcript.Mr. Putin said that Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany's leader, had erred in allowing a million refugees, mostly Syrians, to settle in her country, and that Mr. Trump was correct in trying to halt immigrants and drugs from Mexico.""This liberal idea presupposes that nothing needs to be done,"" Mr. Putin said. ""The migrants can kill, plunder and rape with impunity because their rights as migrants have to be protected.""But ""every crime must have its punishment,"" he told the newspaper. ""The liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.""In the interview, Mr. Putin also criticized what he cast as excessive tolerance for people of diverse sexual orientation and identity. ""We have no problem with L.G.B.T. persons,"" he said. ""But some things appear excessive to us. They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles.""Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, responded on Twitter, saying: ""I strongly disagree with President Putin that liberalism is obsolete. What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs.""Mr. Putin, 66, a former K.G.B. agent who has been Russia's de facto ruler for nearly 20 years, has long shown an understanding of the power of a provocative phrase, and at times flashed a sense of humor as black as coal.He rose to power in Russia after promising to ""whack in the outhouse"" his terrorist enemies in Chechnya, a turn of phrase that proved wildly popular in Russia.Mr. Putin, who from time to time underscores in his speech that he is not a prudish man, once joked that communist labor had the same flaw as group sex, as it's impossible to tell who is working and who is slacking off.Faced with criticism over human rights abuses in the war in Chechnya early in his tenure, he once threatened at a news conference to castrate a reporter who asked a question about land mine victims.In opening remarks before a bilateral meeting at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Trump, speaking with Mr. Putin in a spirit of bonhomie, had commented about reporters, ""Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn't it? You don't have this problem in Russia, but we do.""Mr. Putin responded that ""it's the same"" in Russia.The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the untimely deaths of 58 journalists in Russia in the post-Soviet period, many of them by murder or unexplained accidents.In a conference call with Russian-based reporters Friday, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, clarified that Mr. Putin was not criticizing the liberal political order per se but what he saw as efforts by Western leaders to impose it to the exclusion of other political systems.""Vladimir Putin, in my understanding, remains very close to the ideas of liberalism,"" Mr. Peskov said.""At the same time, if authoritarianism exists somewhere, this is a question of the people of these countries,"" Mr. Peskov said. ""We should not judge them and change the regime and government in these countries.""Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain offered a less-than-enthusiastic greeting to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Group of 20 summit meeting on Friday. Mr. Putin spent the day at the center of a number of political storms. (POOL PHOTO BY ANDY RAIN)",2019-06-29
3571,888331394.xml,"      Europe's leaders believe they can stave off economic disaster without taking real action. They keep pretending that they will not have to ask taxpayers to help shore up fragile banks, that ever larger doses of austerity will let weak economies like Greece pay off their debts, and that Europe can continue to reap the benefits of monetary union without the shared responsibilities of greater fiscal union.    No one else believes this -- not credit markets, which have bid up interest rates on sovereign debt; not the International Monetary Fund, which has warned repeatedly that major banks appear undercapitalized; and not the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which last week forecast negative growth in the coming quarter for Germany, France and Italy, the euro zone's three biggest economies.    The immediate fear is that one or more major European banks may fail. Confidence is plummeting because they have large holdings of Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds. A major bank failure would damage America's economy as well -- which helps explain the urgent pleas from Washington last week for Europe to come up with a strategy for recovery and growth. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met with European finance ministers on Friday to talk about what such a strategy might look like. But so far, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy have shown none of the political leadership necessary to forge a long-term solution.    Meanwhile, the real world keeps intruding on Europe's political fantasies. The healthy appearance of major bank balance sheets vanishes when future write-downs and partial defaults are factored in. Added capital must be set aside for this contingency, and much of it may have to come from public funds. In return, governments must demand a share of future profits and a stronger regulatory hand.    Countries like Italy and Spain already find it impossible to finance their debt without emergency purchases by the European Central Bank, which is only a temporary solution. Issuing common European bonds would be a good step since Europe as a whole can borrow much more cheaply than its debtor countries.    Most important, European leaders must shift from austerity policies that are leading to recession, not relief. They need to stimulate demand in stronger economies, like Germany, and defer austerity measures in fragile ones. One reason Greece keeps missing its deficit targets is that recession is shrinking tax revenues almost as fast as the government can slash spending. Now Italy, whose growth rates have lagged behind Europe's for a decade, is being forced to swallow the same bad medicine.    Energizing growth requires not just easier monetary and fiscal policies, but continued pressure for labor market reforms and privatization of inefficient state companies. It will also require more centralized coordination of fiscal policy for the euro zone's 17 countries. Yet most are still dragging their feet at carrying out the modest reforms their leaders agreed to in July.    There is no time to waste. A debt and banking meltdown in Europe this fall could fracture the euro and drag the world into renewed recession.       ",2011-09-11

A health care worker receives her first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination center in Rostock, Germany on Feb. 12, 2021 After winning widespread recognition for its handling of the coronavirus last year, Germany now finds itself struggling with its sluggish vaccine rollout and a frustrated population. (Lena Mucha/The New York Times)


ROSTOCK, Germany — It was barely noon, but Steffen Bockhahn’s phone had not stopped ringing with people wanting to know if they qualified for a vaccination, and if not now, when?
Days earlier Germany had changed its guidance on who qualified for vaccines, resulting in a seemingly endless stream of questions from worried local residents to Bockhahn, the health minister for this port city in Germany’s northeast.
“No, I’m sorry, but we are not allowed to vaccinate anyone in Category 2 yet, only those nurses or other caregivers are who are in the first priority group,” he told a caller. “You have to wait.”
More than two months into the country’s second full lockdown, people across Germany are growing tired of waiting, whether for vaccines, getting their government compensation, or a return to normalcy. For Germans, it’s a disheartening comedown.
At the start of the pandemic, Germany showed itself to be a global leader in dealing with a once-in-a-century public heath crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel forged a consensus on a lockdown. Her government’s testing and tracing tools were the envy of European neighbors. The country’s death and infection rates were among the lowest in the European Union. Its health care was stellar. And a generally trustful population abided by restrictions with relatively muted grumbling.
No more. In the virus’s second wave, Germany now finds itself swamped like everyone else. A host of tougher new restrictions has stretched on, amid loud complaints, and even occasional protests before everything was shut down again. Still, infection rates hover around 10,000 new cases per day.
Like elsewhere, fears of new variants first identified in England and South Africa are knocking the best-laid plans sideways. Germany’s vaccination program, lashed to the fortunes of the European Union, has floundered. Only 3.5% of Germans have received their first shots, and roughly just 2% have been fully immunized.
For a country used to being No. 1 in Europe — in economic might, with a reputation for efficiency and organization — the turnabout has not been welcomed.
“For too long the country basked in the glow of its early success,” the left-leaning Süddeutsche Zeitung said in an editorial. “Now the coronavirus has laid bare that Germany has dramatic deficits; in its governance, in its administration and with its politicians.”
A survey by the Pew Research Center showed that while more Germans feel confident in their country’s handling of the pandemic than Americans or Britons, their approval dropped 11 percentage points between June and December 2020.
The mood has only soured further as Germans watch other countries, especially Britain, step up their vaccination campaigns with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — developed with the help of German taxpayers — while they have been left waiting for doses to arrive.
Much of the delay stems from production shortages and Germany’s decision to allow the European Union to negotiate for vaccines on its behalf, as it has for all 27 of the bloc’s member states. But that solidarity effectively penalized bigger, richer countries like Germany. Leaders in Brussels have since admitted to mistakes in their joint bargaining, but that has done little to appease Germans still waiting for vaccines.
Merkel’s government has helped BioNTech refurbish a production facility that opened this month, hoping to ease the burden on a Pfizer plant in Belgium that has struggled to meet its orders. But it will take weeks, if not months, before the increased supply reaches vaccination centers.

The center in Rostock opened in late December, but on many days, only the staff are present because there are no doses to administer. On days when vaccines do arrive, there are often so few available that the staff of retired doctors, German Army soldiers and local volunteers outnumber people arriving for their shots.
“We have a great crew here, there is so much team spirit. They want to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,” Bockhahn said. “But when you are able to handle 1,000 per day and are only reaching just 400 this week, that’s frustrating. It’s quite clear.”

Vaccines are only one point of frustration. Mayors are warning of the death of inner cities if small stores are not allowed to reopen. Some states have reopened schools, while others remain shuttered. Doctors are warning of the lasting psychological damage that the lockdown is having on children.
Parents, too, are frustrated with the lack of support for online learning. Germany’s stringent data protection laws prevent Germans from using U.S.-based digital learning platforms, but local solutions do not always function smoothly. In many public schools, education now consists of teachers sending lessons as email attachments for students to work through on their own.
Small and independent business owners are struggling to comprehend the rules that dictate whether they are allowed to work and if not, whether they qualify for compensation. Many of them are struggling to stay afloat, while others have given up. Small businesses have been hit harder than the industrial sector as the German economy has contracted by 5% over the past year.
Merkel has done her best to buck up a weary public. Over the past month, the normally reserved chancellor has appeared before the Berlin news corps, given two interviews on prime-time television and chatted by video with families overwhelmed by caring for children at home. Each time she offered assurances, whether to parents exhausted by juggling home-schooling with their jobs, or hairdressers eager to return to work.
“I wish that I had something good to announce,” she said, addressing the nation.
So do Germans. With the country gearing up for an general election in September — Merkel has said she will not run again — and votes in several states in the months ahead, the willingness to line up behind the lame-duck chancellor is weakening, as politicians begin jockeying for position before the end of her more than 15 years in power.
“Since the last lockdown, I have reduced all of the overheads that I possibly can,” said Helmuth Fromberger, who runs a small photo studio in the Bavarian town of Mühldorf. “But I’ve reached the point where I can’t cut back any further.”
Normally at this time of year, he would be busy taking portraits and planning for spring and summer weddings. This year he is allowed only to take passport photos, which brings in just about $70 per day. But because he is allowed to stay open, he does not qualify for the benefits drawn up by the government to help businesses offset losses.
“I don’t actually want any handouts from the government,” he said in a telephone interview. “But when they prevent me from working, then they have to take responsibility for that.”

In recent weeks, dozens of hair salons across the country have banded together to bring lawsuits against their forced closures in each of the country’s 16 states. The concerted effort is partially credited with a decision by Merkel and the governors to allow salons to reopen in early March, as long as the number of new infections does not explode.
André Amberg, who runs a hair salon in the central city of Gotha, filed a lawsuit against the government in his home state of Thuringia. He was forced to close his doors in mid-December and file for unemployment.
“What is most frustrating for me is that I am no longer able to decide for myself about my own life and work situation,” he said. “I’m completely at the mercy of the government.”

So Germans wait. Wait for their leaders to come up with solutions. Wait for infection numbers to drop. Wait to get vaccinated.
Dr. Reinhard Treptow, one of dozens of retired doctors who volunteered to administer vaccinations in Rostock, has spent more time waiting for doses to arrive than giving people their shots.
“We could be doing so much more,” he said, gesturing to the stalls — now empty — where doctors administer injections at the center. “What we need are more doses.”

Asked if he thought Germany would have been wiser to acquire vaccines independently of its European Union partners, he hesitated, then noted that his daughter, who lives in South Carolina, had already received her first dose.
“Let’s just say that it hasn’t worked well here,” he said.

2465,434258122.xml,"      Iranian officials continued to cast blame for the nation's recent political crisis on foreign interference on Wednesday, focusing their  ire for the first time  on  Germany, one of the country's  closest trading partners,  with an accusation that  its diplomats and intelligence agents helped  organize protests at the end of December.   The accusations followed stronger statements against Iran's nuclear program by German officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, who raised the scpecter of new international sanctions against Iran, and an announcement on Tuesday by the Munich-based engineering giant Siemens that it would seek no new business there.    ""There is a long tradition of economic cooperation between Germany and Iran,"" Mrs. Merkel said Tuesday at a news conference with the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, at the conclusion of his four-day visit. ""But we believe it is only effective if you try to introduce international sanctions on as broad a base as possible.""    The accusations also coincided with a round of meetings between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and foreign ministers from Russia, Indonesia and Turkey over Iran's nuclear program.   Iranian news reports on Wednesday said that an official with Iran's intelligence ministry told reporters in Tehran that two German intelligence agents -- ""Yogi"" and ""Ingo"" -- were part of a German team that helped recruit young people to join  protests that turned violent during a normally somber Shiite holiday, Ashura.    ""Individuals who were arrested on Ashura were from various groups, one of which was linked with the German intelligence services and was being led by German diplomats,"" said the unnamed intelligence official,  according to the semi-official ILNA news service.   The official told reporters that the protests were organized abroad and cited what he evidence to support his contention: a Facebook page in support of Mir Hussein  Moussavi, an opposition leader,  run by Iranian expatriates living in Germany; ""incitement"" from BBC Farsi and Voice of America; invitations from the People's Mujaheeen, an exile group Iran considers a terrorist organization; and the fact that many arrested protesters were from outside Tehran.   But some details of the Iranian account were a matter of confusion; several Iranian new agencies reported that German diplomats had been arrested, while others said only that German diplomats had been involved.  One report said that it was an aide to Mr. Moussavi who was arrested.    Those that reported the German arrests -- including state television -- did not say if the diplomats were still in custody, while other news agencies reported that the authorities only arrested an aide to Mir Hussein Moussavi, a principal opposition leader.   ""Two individuals from among Germany's diplomats participated in Ashura Day unrest, and they had Green symbols alongside themselves, and they were distributing even these Green symbols, including T-shirts, to this group of boys and girls,"" was how the ILNA semi-official news agency reported the accusation. The MEHR and ISNA semi-official news agencies reported the arrests, while English-language Press TV did not.    The challenge of following events in Iran has grown more complicated since the disputed presidential election last year set of enduring unrest. The government continues to limit foreign access and independent reporting and to penalize local news organizations that offer what the state deems critical reports.    For its part, the German government denied that its agents played any role in the protests, or that its diplomats were arrested. ""We reject these accusations in every possible form,"" Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday.    But Andreas Peschke, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, appeared to leave open the possibility that German nationals might have been arrested, telling a news conference in Berlin, ""No German diplomats were arrested on December 27th last year.""    The German news service dpa reported that  two German police officers who worked at the embassy but did not have diplomatic status had been arrested, but a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry in Berlin said that such  reports were ""rumors and nothing more.""   Whatever the details, it was clear that the Iranian leadership continues to blame its political unrest  on an international conspiracy of foreign governments and expatriate Iranians seeking to topple the government. Iran experts said that the leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, in particular, believe that the West is trying to mastermind a  revolution.   The Iranian intelligence official, in his statement to reporters,  said that a group of expatriates function as liaisons between foreign governments and the opposition inside Iran. They include, he said, a former minister of culture, Atollah Mohajerani, and a prominent cleric, Mohsen Kadivar, both now living in the United States.    ""Anti-Islamic Revolution agents, networks backed by Western intelligence services"" and those who seek to promote ""sedition"" in the country planned the Ashura protests, ISNA quoted the official as saying .    From the  start of Iran's eight-month-old political crisis, the supreme leader,  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,  and his allies in the military and intelligence services have blamed foreign governments for attempting to organize and promote the kind of soft  revolutions that brought down governments in Eastern Europe. Until now,  Iran had focused its accusations on  the United States, Britain and Israel.   Germany is one of Iran's biggest and most important trading partners, but  Berlin has been trying to curtail business with Iran  as part of the increase in international pressure to stop Iran's nuclear program.   At the time of the Ashura demonstrations, Mrs. Merkel condemned the violence as being ""a result of the unacceptable actions of the security forces.""    At the news conference on Tuesday   Mrs. Merkel said that the international community had shown ""great patience"" with Iran, but that ""the time has come for us to discuss sanctions also on the international level.""    On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton, in London for conferences on Yemen and Afghanistan, tried to jump-start the global effort to press Iran on its nuclear program. She also planned to meet Thursday with the  foreign minister of China, which has been reluctant to consider fresh sanctions against Tehran.    The chief executive of Siemens,  Peter Loscher,   told shareholders on Tuesday that the company's  board had decided last October to stop seeking new contracts with Iran by mid-2010.   ""Iran sees itself, so to speak, confronted with the developments on the German side, from Siemens and especially by the clear statements from Merkel during the visit by Peres on harder sanctions,"" said Konstantin Kosten, an expert on Iran at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.   On Monday, Iranian officials summoned the Swiss ambassador, who represents American interests in Iran, and to complain about American involvement in the recent assassination of Masoud Ali Mohammadi, though according to his friends and his writings, he supported the reform movement -- not the hard-line leadership. Iran also implicated Israel and Britain in the killing.   In a speech on Tuesday, Ayatollah  Khamenei said that the protesters would  fail  because they are""dependent on the enemy.""   ""America has spent $45 million in fighting the Islamic system through diplomacy, sanctions, the deployment of spies, hiring mercenaries, and other methods, but has not reached a single positive result,"" he said.

2907,1618074533.xml,"       Of all the candidates running in next Tuesday's American midterm elections, only one, it seems to me, really has Halloween potential -- which is to say, only one has succeeded in identifying herself closely enough with a specific sartorial semiology that a Pavlovian association is created in a viewer's mind. See the garment, think the person. I am speaking, of course, of Wendy Davis, the Texas state senator and beleaguered candidate for governor, as well as famed Mizuno sneaker wearer. A blond wig, a bright suit and those sneakers doth a costume create. Who needs masks when you have fashion? Clothes have the power to define a person and a position, and though they are often seen as handicapping women in positions of authority, acting as a distraction from their achievements and substance, they can also be a strategic communication tool. One that is, ironically, more accessible to women than to men, who are stuck in a never-ending generic suit loop, forced to rely on the distinguishing characteristics of hair and tie color.  If in doubt, simply consider an exhibition that opened Wednesday in London at the Design Museum titled ""Women Fashion Power."" It has little to do with fashion as trend-driven designer vision, makes no aesthetic judgments and shies away from ""power dressing"" in the 1980s-Joan Collins-""Working Girl""-big-shouldered sense of the word. Rather, it focuses on image and authority in the public eye. ""It felt like it was the right time to look at the rise of women in contemporary power roles, and how they view and use fashion to facilitate their place in the world,"" said Donna Loveday, a co-curator, describing the show as one of the most ambitious the museum has done. She and her fellow curator, the fashion historian and journalist Colin McDowell, began work on the exhibition 10 months ago. Designed by Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, it is laid out over almost 6,500 square feet in three parts: There is an analytic ""corridor of power"" that identifies 16 of the most influential dressers in history, starting with Hatshepsut, the Egyptian queen who used elements of male dress to establish authority after her husband's death, and culminating with Hillary Rodham Clinton; a 150-year timeline highlighting moments of public sartorial change (the ""freedom from constraints"" of the turn of the 20th century, the suffragist movement of the 1920s); and, most significant, a gallery of current power players who contributed a Q. and A. and favorite garments that reflect their words. And since, as Ms. Loveday pointed out, ""I don't think there has really been an exhibit in a museum on the subject before,"" it makes me wonder if this signifies a turning point in our own relationship with fashion. Just consider the fact that the show includes 25 high-profile women happy to go public with their thoughts on clothing. This includes the usual suspects: fashion professionals like Natalie Massenet, the executive chairwoman of Net-a-Porter; the designer Vivienne Westwood; and the model Naomi Campbell. But it also includes Wei Sun Christianson, a co-chief executive of Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific; Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris (who also opened the exhibition); Alfiya Kuanysheva, the chief executive of the Kazakhstan finance group BATT; and Kirsty Wark, the British broadcaster. That, it seems to me, is an enormous and meaningful change in the conversation about achievement and gender. The idea that women whose power is undeniable and exists in traditionally male sectors like banking and politics may stand up and say, for the record and posterity, that clothes matter and require (and deserve) thought is, in my experience, unprecedented.  Even just three years ago, Michelle Obama, featured in the corridor of power, was denying giving any real consideration to clothing, announcing on ""Good Morning America"": ""Look, women, wear what you love. That's all I can say. That's my motto."" (It just so happened that she loved wearing dresses from small American brands made by designers with notably diverse backgrounds, hence raising their profile on the international stage -- but, hey, guess that was a coincidence.) Fashion, like money -- if not more than money -- has been the off-limits topic, the subject whispered about and obsessed over but rarely acknowledged in any nonpejorative way. It's the invisible elephant in the room; like disinformation, it's the tool all people use -- and have used, as the exhibition makes clear, since Joan of Arc threw on some male armor -- but refuse to admit they use.  ""For a very long period, as women began entering the workplace and taking up roles traditionally occupied by men, the subject of dress was really put to one side and treated as a frivolous distraction,"" Ms. Loveday said. Indeed, in a Daily Beast article last year about Ms. Davis and her sneakers, the liberal pundit Sally Kohn wrote that noting what women wear ""undercuts the leadership of women and quashes their voice."" It seems to me, however, and this exhibition shows, that the situation is the opposite: What women wear is an embodiment of their voice, and identifying it helps identify their agenda (as it does with men, for that matter).  Granted, there were still women, and some very big names, that chose not to take part in the Q. and A. section of the Design Museum show. Ms. Loveday had Angela Merkel, Queen Elizabeth II and Mrs. Clinton on her wish list, and all begged off from participating in the interactive, though they are mentioned in the show. But, Ms. Loveday said, the reason she was given for their demurrals was not ""I don't want to be seen talking about that subject,"" but rather ""time."" Before you say, ""Well, isn't that the same thing and weren't they just being polite?,"" consider the fact that a few years ago, when I was trying to convene a panel of power women to do some image analysis for a different newspaper, the answer I heard over and over again from chief executives I approached was a straightforward: ""Thanks for thinking of me, but I can't be involved in any overt discussion of fashion. It would undermine my hard-won seriousness."" (I'm paraphrasing, but not that much.) I'm not saying the time excuse should be taken at face value or is anything but an excuse (though it could be true), but the sheer fact that the women involved bothered to make it, as opposed to taking umbrage at the very idea they might think about clothing, is, in my book, a step forward. Besides, even without the active participation of such pivotal figures, it is meaningful to think that for six months visitors to the Design Museum will be able to read the property developer Morwenna Wilson's words -- ""Jackets are very important to me because I am petite and a woman, yet one with responsibility and authority working in a male dominated industry, often with a team of people older than me"" -- and Ms. Christianson of Morgan Stanley attesting that ""I decided that while I was working in a man's world, I was not going to suppress my femininity in an attempt to blend in."" ""It's an incredibly positive message,"" said Ms. Loveday, referring to not just Ms. Christianson's words, but also her willingness to contribute. I would have to agree. Even more pointedly, the fact that this is now a public subject of conversation, blessed by a major institution, suggests that perhaps during the coming British elections, which will take place in May but with campaigning beginning in January, image analysis may be discussed in formerly unheard-of ways -- and vis-à-vis candidates of any sex. And given that after ""Women Fashion Power"" closes in London, it may travel to the United States, Asia and Europe, it could potentially play a part in the presidential election here, if Mrs. Clinton is a candidate. And that in turn means that it is possible that this political cycle, instead of the usual disingenuous disavowals and fights about whether or not clothes are a legitimate part of spin and manipulation and the fight for higher office, we may actually be able to have a meaningful conversation about how exactly our candidates are attempting to communicate through cloth, and what exactly the subtext is.

92,1753352920.xml,"       BERLIN --  The tensions simmering beneath Germany's willingness to take in one million migrants blew into the open on Tuesday after reports that scores of young women in Cologne had been groped and robbed on New Year's Eve by gangs of men described by the authorities as having ""a North African or Arabic"" appearance. Taking advantage of the New Year's Eve street party, hundreds of young men broke into groups and formed rings around young women, refusing to let them escape, the authorities said. Some groped victims while others stole wallets or cellphones.  Witnesses described the atmosphere around the city's central train station as aggressive and threatening, with firecrackers being thrown into the crowd. The women who were attacked screamed and tried to fight their way free, a man who had struggled to protect his girlfriend told German public television. The Cologne police added that they had received 90 complaints from victims, including one who said she had been raped. No arrests have been made. In Hamburg, the police said 10 women had reported that they were sexually assaulted and robbed in a similar fashion on the same night.  It was not clear that any of the men involved were among those who arrived in Germany over the past year from conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a statement, called the assaults disgusting. ""Everything must be done to investigate as completely and quickly as possible those who are guilty and to punish them regardless of how they look, where they come from or what their background is,"" she said. The assaults initially were not highlighted by the police and were largely ignored by the German news media in the days afterward.  The attacks and the livid reaction to them presented a new political challenge for the chancellor, whose decision to take in refugees from conflict-ridden nations opened the doors to waves of migrants last summer and fall. As the number of asylum-seekers has grown and the challenge of assimilating them has become clearer, Ms. Merkel has come under intensifying criticism for failing to anticipate the social and economic costs of her policy. The descriptions of the assailants -- by the police and victims quoted in the news media -- as young foreign men who spoke neither German nor English immediately stoked the debate over how to integrate such large numbers of migrants and focused new attention on how to deal with the influx of young, mostly Muslim men from more socially conservative cultures where women do not share the same freedoms and protections as men. The assaults set off accusations on the right and among some political commentators that the authorities and the news media had tried to ignore or cover up the attacks to avoid fueling a backlash against the refugees. Far-right and anti-immigrant groups and other Germans who oppose the influx seized on the attacks, saying they demonstrated the dangers associated with accepting huge numbers of migrants. ""It is time to send a signal,"" said Christopher Freiherr von Mengersen, head of the nationalist Pro-NRW movement, based in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. ""We locals can no longer put up with everything that is being routinely swept under the rug based on a false sense of tolerance."" Even beyond the usual circle of anti-immigration activists, similar concern could be heard over whether the government's policy had come at too high a price to social stability. ""The government's loss of control is not only taking place on the borders,"" Alexander Marguier, deputy editor in chief of the monthly political magazine Cicero, wrote online. ""For whoever gives up control of who enters the country no longer has control over the consequences of this action."" Henriette Reker, Cologne's mayor, who was stabbed during a campaign event in October by a German man who opposed her welcoming attitude toward migrants, sought Tuesday to play down the links to refugees, after meeting with police, state and city officials. ""There are no indications that this involved people who have sought shelter in Cologne as refugees,"" Ms. Reker said. The assaults reported in Cologne were said to have taken place late Thursday in the city's main train station and the public square in front of it. The station was a central transit point for anyone coming from or going to a fireworks display over the Rhine and the bars and nightclubs in the heart of the city, in the shadow of its landmark cathedral. The police in Cologne say they believe several hundred men, ages 15 to 35 and visibly drunk, were involved in the violence, which began when they tossed firecrackers into the crowd that had thronged the square. The police cleared the area shortly before midnight, blocking the main entrance to the station in an attempt to control the situation, said Wolfgang Albers, Cologne's chief of police. In the chaos that ensued after the square was cleared, the men appeared to have moved into the crowds, and that was when the assaults began. ""Nobody knew where to go,"" Sascha Frohn, who said he was in the station on Thursday, told the public broadcaster WDR. ""We stood with our backs to the wall and could see how people were robbed and German girls were groped. I was surrounded by a group of 50 to 60 people from Arabic countries. They would come up to us, shake hands and then try to reach into our bags."" Only after the square was reopened, after midnight, did the police begin receiving reports that women had been attacked. Cologne, with roughly one million people, is among Germany's most ethnically diverse cities, and it took in more than 10,000 refugees last year. The city authorities said they would increase security after the assaults, including installing closed-circuit surveillance cameras, even as they urged anyone who videotaped the events on Thursday night to come forward. But the situation quickly became as much about politics as about the law enforcement response. Since the start of the year, Ms. Merkel has come under renewed pressure from within her own conservative bloc, with Horst Seehofer, head of the Bavarian sister party to the chancellor's Christian Democratic Union, calling for a cap of 200,000 refugees allowed into the country per year. Calls came from the Bavarian Christian Social Union on Tuesday to deport any asylum-seekers found to be among the perpetrators in Cologne, a sentiment echoed by the left-leaning Süddeutsche-Zeitung in a commentary that noted that German law provides for such action. Yet the commentary, by Heribert Prantl, also warned about the risks of the debate's taking on a poisonous tone that would only make integration of the many young refugees and immigrants legitimately in the country that much more difficult. ""The young men who come to Germany must begin working as quickly as possible,"" he wrote. ""Work socializes. It is about our national peace, which is threatened by the excesses in Cologne and the excesses in the Internet."" Several hundred people gathered in front of Cologne's cathedral late Tuesday to protest violence against women. Several groups promoting women's rights have complained that the authorities have not taken allegations of sexual abuse of women in refugee shelters seriously enough. To prevent further violence in Cologne during the coming Carnival celebrations, when thousands of costumed revelers throng the streets for the beginning of Lent, which falls on Feb. 10 this year, Ms. Reker said that city officials would work to help women protect themselves and to explain the city's attitudes and norms to newcomers. ""We will explain our Carnival much better to people who come from other cultures,"" she said, ""so there won't be any confusion about what constitutes celebratory behavior in Cologne, which has nothing to do with a sexual frankness.""

2025,433584008.xml,"      The United States has rejected Germany's proposal for deep long-term cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, setting the stage for a battle that will pit President Bush against his European allies at next month's meeting of the world's richest countries. In unusually harsh language, Bush administration negotiators took issue with the German draft of the communique for the meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, complaining that the proposal ''crosses multiple red lines in terms of what we simply cannot agree to.''  ''We have tried to tread lightly, but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position,'' the American response said. Germany, backed by Britain and now Japan, has proposed cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who will be the host of the meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Heiligendamm next month, has been pushing hard to get the Group of 8 to take significant action on climate change. It had been a foregone conclusion that the Western European members of the Group of 8 -- Germany, Italy, France and Britain -- would back the reductions. But on Thursday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan threw his lot in with the Europeans, and proposed cutting carbon emissions as part of a new framework to replace the Kyoto Protocol, whose mandatory caps on gases end in 2012. ''The Kyoto Protocol was the first, concrete step for the human race to tackle global warming, but we must admit that it has limitations,'' Mr. Abe said at a conference in Tokyo. He specifically called on the United States and China, the biggest producers of carbon emissions, to lead the fight against global warming. The United States has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because of concerns about damage to the American economy. Bush administration officials have also balked because China and India are not part of it. The push back by the Bush administration over the German proposal has left many European diplomats furious. ''The United States, on this issue, is virtually isolated,'' one European diplomat said on condition of anonymity under diplomatic rules, and then added, ''with the exception of other big polluters.'' Both Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have, in private talks with President Bush, pushed for the United States to agree to the European proposal. Kristen A. Hellmer, a spokeswoman for the White House on environmental issues, said: ''All the G-8 countries are committed to pursuing an agreement. We just come at it from different perspectives.'' A clearly disappointed Ms. Merkel, speaking to Germany's lower house of Parliament on Thursday, sought to lower expectations that Mr. Bush would agree to the more ambitious agenda sought by Europe and Japan. ''I can say quite openly that, today, I don't know whether we will succeed in that at Heiligendamm,'' she said. The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, produces between a fifth and a quarter of the world's emissions, according to government data. Emissions in Europe and the United States have been slowing of late, with a slight drop in the United States in 2006. But much more growth is forecast by various agencies on both sides of the Atlantic and particularly in Asia.  ",2007-05-26
2390,1022367233.xml,"      Stocks rose on Wednesday as stronger-than-expected economic data helped lift energy stocks, overshadowing concerns that a European Union summit meeting would not yield progress in easing the euro zone's debt crisis.   The energy sector showed the strongest gains among the 10 major groups in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Cabot Oil and Gas jumped 9 percent to $41.24 and was the biggest advancer on the S. & P. 500.   Worries about Europe have fed sharp sell-offs in stocks lately, but the declines have been tempered by enough short-term buying to keep the market confined to a trading range.   ""Sentiment is pretty negative,"" said Douglas Foreman, director of equities at Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management. ""When you get people this depressed, markets have a tendency to bounce and that is pretty much where we are at right now.""    Investors seemed encouraged by a better-than-expected report on orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in May, which rose 1.1 percent.   Signed contracts for home purchases jumped 5.9 percent in May to a seven-month high. The PHLX housing sector index climbed 3 percent, taking the year-to-date gains near 26 percent.   Shares of Lennar, a leading home builder, rose 4.8 percent to $28.70 after it reported a rise in new orders for the fifth straight quarter.   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 92.34 points, or 0.74 percent, to close at 12,627.01. The S.& P. 500 index advanced 11.86 points, or 0.90 percent, to close at 1,331.85. The Nasdaq composite index added 21.26 points, or 0.74 percent, to close at 2,875.32.   But uncertainty remained ahead of the meeting of European Union leaders, which begins on Thursday. Few expect anything concrete to emerge from the two-day meeting after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said debt-sharing, an idea backed by France, Italy and Spain, would not happen in her lifetime.   Health care stocks were in focus ahead of Thursday's decision on the 2010 health care law from the United States Supreme Court.    Many investors expect the requirement that uninsured Americans purchase health insurance to be overturned, ""so people have had plenty of time to position their portfolios for that,"" Mr. Foreman said.   Arena Pharmaceuticals surged 28.7 percent to $11.39 on news that the Food and Drug Administration had approved the drug maker's pill to treat obesity, the first new weight-loss drug in 13 years. The Nasdaq biotechnology index gained 1.5 percent.   Shares of Vivus and Orexigen Therapeutics jumped. The companies are also hoping to take weight-loss drugs to market. Vivus shares were up 7.4 percent to $28.33 and Orexigen Therapeutics rose 20.3 percent to $4.92.   Some of Wall Street's top analysts published research about Facebook, and most are cautiously optimistic. Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent, to $32.23, after gaining more than 20 percent in the previous two weeks.   In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 101 6/32, while its yield fell to 1.62 percent, from 1.63 percent late Tuesday.

4042,2442512119.xml,"Mr. Navalny talked with a German prosecutor about being poisoned. Word of his improvement came as France and Sweden confirmed that he had been sickened by Novichok, a Russian nerve agent.BERLIN -- Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader who is recovering from being poisoned, has spoken to a German prosecutor about the attempt on his life and says he plans to return to Russia as soon as he has recovered, a senior German security official said on Monday.Mr. Navalny had been in a medically induced coma at the Charité hospital in Berlin and it was not clear what condition he would be in once he regained consciousness. But the security official, who was briefed on his condition, said Mr. Navalny seemed mentally sharp.""He's fully aware of his condition, he's fully aware of what happened and he's fully aware of where he is,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the case.The news came hours after the German government announced that laboratories in France and Sweden had confirmed that the substance used to poison Mr. Navalny was a form of the nerve agent Novichok, results that match Berlin's own findings and provide additional confidence that the Russian state was involved.""Three laboratories have now independently provided evidence of a substance from the Novichok group as the cause of Mr. Navalny's poisoning,"" a German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement. ""We renew the call for Russia to explain what has happened.""Mr. Navalny remains heavily guarded by German police in the hospital. In his conversation with the German prosecutor, he refused to cooperate with a Russian request to jointly investigate the case with Germany, the security official said, adding that once he recovers, Mr. Navalny plans to return to Russia.""He's not planning to go into exile in Germany,"" the official said. ""He wants to go home to Russia and he wants to continue his mission.""Russian officials were not immediately informed of Mr. Navalny's refusal to cooperate, and did not initially respond to news of the French and Swedish tests. They have insisted that there was no proof Mr. Navalny had been poisoned. They have suggested several alternative theories, including a drug overdose and low blood sugar.In his statement, Mr. Seibert described the use of Novichok -- a class of potent nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union and used at least once before in an assassination attempt by Russian intelligence operatives -- as a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Russia is a signatory.But even as patience with President Vladimir V. Putin is running thin, Berlin is struggling to determine how to respond. Some have suggested canceling the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a nearly completed, $11 billion project to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany. So far, however, the German government, its European allies and the United States have not taken any action aside from raising the prospect of additional sanctions on Russia.The poisoning of Mr. Navalny is the latest in a long string of killings or attempted killings of Kremlin opponents in recent years. On Aug. 20, after campaigning in Siberia for antigovernment candidates for local offices, he collapsed, was hospitalized and flown to Germany for treatment two days later.Local elections were held across Russia over the weekend, and Mr. Navalny and his allies made modest gains. In the opposition's biggest victory, Mr. Putin's United Russia party lost its majority on the City Council in Novosibirsk, a Siberian industrial hub and Russia's third-largest city.The attack on Mr. Navalny increases the strain on the close, complicated and increasingly contradictory German-Russian relationship.Chancellor Angela Merkel has been unusually clear in her sharp condemnation of Moscow's  brazen actions and lack of cooperation. Less than a year ago, a former Chechen rebel leader was assassinated in broad daylight in a Berlin park, a killing that German federal prosecutors say was orchestrated by the Russian state.Ms. Merkel, who normally speaks with Mr. Putin by phone at least once a week, has not spoken to him since Mr. Navalny's poisoning, a senior German security official said. On Monday, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, canceled a meeting scheduled for this week with his German counterpart, Heiko Maas. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry did not mention the Navalny poisoning and said the cancellation had to do with a scheduling conflict.President Emmanuel Macron of France raised the poisoning in a phone call with Mr. Putin on Monday, affirming the French laboratory results and asking that ""all light be shed, without delay, on the circumstances and responsibilities of this attempted assassination,"" according to a readout provided by the French government. The readout did not include Mr. Putin's response.Ms. Merkel has been one of the tougher leaders in Europe when it comes to Russia, demanding a strong line on maintaining economic sanctions imposed after Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, even in the face of pushback at home and in other capitals.But she has also worked hard to keep diplomatic lines to Moscow open. The two countries have deep economic links, not least in the energy market, and a sizable faction in German politics believes that Russia should be an important partner.Ms. Merkel appears to be treading carefully once again -- at least for now. German officials did not raise Mr. Navalny's poisoning last week, when Dmitri Kozak, a close confidant of Mr. Putin, was allowed to land in Berlin for talks related to the war in Ukraine, despite a travel ban.Germany has refused to rule out a re-evaluation of Nord Stream 2, but Ms Merkel has long defended the project and experts say it is unlikely to be scrapped.The German response so far contrasts sharply with Britain's reaction in 2018, after the poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian spy, in the English city of Salisbury. Once the British government announced that Russian operatives had used Novichok in that case, it gave the Kremlin 24 hours to respond, after which it imposed sanctions and rallied allies to expel dozens of Russian diplomats.But German officials insist that the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is not a bilateral issue between Germany and Russia. Unlike Mr. Skripal, who held British citizenship and was attacked on British soil, Mr. Navalny is a Russian who was in Russia when he was poisoned.German officials are considering a variety of possible sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes against individuals, and are hoping for a response backed by all European Union member states.""We want this to be a European sanctions regime to show that this is about our values when a leading opposition politician is poisoned,"" said one senior German security official involved in the discussions.The official said that while it was important to send a message that Russia's behavior was out of line, it should not come at the expense of continued negotiations on issues like the wars in Ukraine and Syria, where Russia is a key player.""This is a terrible thing, we have to sanction it, but it will not lead to a totally new Russia policy,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about internal deliberations. ""The hard reality is: We need Russia on Ukraine, Libya, Syria. We don't want everything to collapse.""Mr. Navalny's recovery could also influence the eventual response, but doctors now expect him to make a full recovery, the senior official said.Traces of the poison were found in samples taken from Mr. Navalny at the hospital in Berlin but also, crucially, on a water bottle that had traveled with him from Russia, German officials said. They have rejected Moscow's demand for ""proof"" that Mr. Navalny was poisoned inside Russia, noting that the Russian authorities had taken their own samples and confiscated dozens of objects before he was flown to Germany.""They have their proof,"" one official said.Within Russia, Mr. Navalny hoped to capitalize on discontent over Russia's economic slump and the coronavirus pandemic. Support for Mr. Putin has softened in recent years and dropped even further this year, said Denis Volkov, deputy director of Levada, an independent polling organization.Russia's political system enforces support for Mr. Putin on a national level but allows more diversity in local elections -- an opening Mr. Navalny tried to seize to loosen the grip of the governing United Russia party. He encouraged the fractious opposition to unite behind a single candidate in each race.In Novosibirsk, United Russia won 22 or 23 seats of 50 council seats, according to preliminary results, with one race still contested. That is down from 33 seats. Mr. Navalny's regional representative there, Sergei Boiko, and other opposition figures won council seats despite the poisoning of their leader, a stink bomb attack on Mr. Navalny's office in the city and allegations of ballot stuffing.Mr. Navalny is aware of the results and said he is pleased, the senior German official said.Mr. Navalny's allies also won a smattering of seats on other councils, including two in Tomsk, the last city he visited on his campaign swing.But no mass movement in sympathy with Mr. Navalny has emerged, and there is no sign that the poisoning has shaken up Russian politics. United Russia's failings were already well known and some losses had been expected, said Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.""I am surprised by how little impact the poisoning"" has had, he said.Katrin Bennhold reported from Berlin, and Michael Schwirtz from London. Reporting was contributed by Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Angela Merkel, above, has not spoken with Vladimir Putin since Aleksei Navalny was poisoned.

2244,238070097.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED PARIS -- A few weeks after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the world plunged into a  financial crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany offered some common-sense advice to reckless bankers, indebted consumers and profligate governments.   ""One should simply have asked a Swabian housewife,"" Mrs. Merkel said during an address to fellow Christian Democrats in December 2008 in the southwest German region of Swabia, hub of the Protestant work ethic. ""She would have told us her worldly wisdom: in the long run, you can't live beyond your means.""   Now, as Europe struggles  to avoid its own Lehman experience -- saving Greece and thus the euro -- the episode says much about the Germans.   Led by France, European neighbors have been pressing for months for Germany, which has the Continent's biggest economy, to throw its financial weight behind a bailout package and a new system of economic governance for the euro zone. In the process, a reluctant Berlin has been called irresponsible, selfish and even un-European.   But if France wants Germany to be more European, Germany wants Europe to be more Swabian. To bring Europe to a  compromise required a deal between Mrs. Merkel and a Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the International Monetary Fund, who met in Berlin last week to pull Greece and the euro zone back from the brink.   The Greek episode has heated up the long culture clash between the European Union's traditional drivers: federal Germany with its Prussian attachment to rules and an instinctive frugality rooted in past economic traumas, and republican France with its tradition of state intervention and a more Mediterranean attitude toward public debt.   Paris and Berlin have had many disagreements in the postwar world, but few are as deep-rooted as those on economic governance, said John C. Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany.   ""This comes from the gut, it's emotional,"" said Mr. Kornblum, who as assistant secretary of state for Europe in the 1990s watched successive French and German leaders spar over how to govern the future single currency.   If there is no political structure in place to safeguard the euro --  a weakness exposed in the current debt crisis --  Mr. Kornblum said it was because Germany and France could never agree on one. ""There are profound philosophical differences between the two sides,"" he said.   These differences are in many ways personified by Mrs. Merkel, daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and two flamboyant Frenchmen: President Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist.   Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Strauss-Kahn are rivals and may even run against each other in the 2012 presidential election. But they share a belief in state intervention that unites most of the French political elite.   Mr. Sarkozy, a Gaullist whose millionaire friends and taste for expensive brands have not gone unnoticed across the Rhine, first roused German suspicions as finance minister in 2004 when he prevented a takeover by Siemens of Alstom, the French maker of trains.   As president, he allowed the budget deficit to rise above the 3 percent euro zone limit even before the economic crisis erupted, and he repeatedly criticized the European Central Bank's interest rate policy.   Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a native of a suburb of Paris who speaks German, has been called ""Mr. Euro"" in France and is credited with steering his country into the euro zone as finance minister in 1997. In Germany, he is also remembered for serving under President Jacques Chirac, a staunch advocate of a political counterweight to the European Central Bank.   So when the two men independently revived calls for an ""economic government"" of the 16 countries that share the euro,  resistance in Germany was instinctive.   In a country where many lost their savings twice in the 20th century -- once to hyperinflation in 1923 and again to currency reform after World War II -- central bank independence and budgetary discipline have become part of the German narrative.   Fear of inflation and broad-based aversion to debt also help to explain a striking divergence in the perception of Germany's wealth at home and abroad. At 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, Germany's budget deficit is low by crisis standards and frequently cited as a justification to appeal to Berlin for solidarity with poorer countries.   In contrast, the French budget deficit has widened to 7.5 percent of G.D.P. But Germans, who have absorbed East Germany and face a declining population, do not feel rich.   ""Germans fear going bankrupt themselves,"" said Mr. Kornblum, now a consultant in Berlin.   Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former minister of European affairs who now leads the French stock market regulator, said: ""The fundamental difference between France and Germany is that, for the French, budgetary, financial and currency stability is a means to an end. For the Germans it is an end in itself.""   Mrs. Merkel, a physicist raised in communist East Germany, has a hard-working, parsimonious lifestyle and an analytical, somewhat bland personality that in many ways reflect the national value system, said Gerd Langguth, author of a 2005 biography of her.   While Mr. Sarkozy resides in the majestic Elysee Palace and has an army of staff members, Mrs. Merkel still lives in the central Berlin apartment she occupied before her election in 2005 and has been seen  doing her own shopping.   There are limits to national stereotyping. Mrs. Merkel's more outgoing predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, made common cause with the French in breaking the euro zone's budgetary limit.   And no German could have defended the legacy of the Bundesbank more vigorously than the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, referred to by some in Paris as ""that Frenchman in Frankfurt.""   But understanding the radically different contexts in which German and French positions are honed is crucial as Europe's two foremost powers grapple with the crisis, said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a research institute based in Brussels.   ""Ultimately this is about whether Germany is ready to lead,"" he said. ""And leading means compromising, rather than only insisting on red lines.""   Correction: May 7, 2010, Friday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the cultural traits that divide Germany from some of its European neighbors in the Greek debt crisis misidentified the birthplace of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Frenchman who is managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

1478,1709511674.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  In late spring, with the war in Syria grinding into its fifth year amid an ever-deepening humanitarian catastrophe for millions of refugees, 14 United States senators wrote a letter to President Obama urging that at least 65,000 of the displaced Syrians be allowed to resettle in the United States. Critics denounced the idea, saying it would open the nation's borders to potential terrorists, and some even branded the authors of the letter as the ""jihadi caucus."" The criticism, which Obama administration officials say is baseless because of screening procedures asylum seekers undergo, was a powerful measure of the lack of political will and the practical obstacles that have hampered the United States' ability to intervene more directly in what has become a full-blown migrant crisis in Europe. Such obstacles, including an American public weary of overseas initiatives after more than a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, remain formidable, even as heart-wrenching photographs of dead children this week focused the American conscience on the Syrian crisis as never before and prompted renewed calls for more aid. Pleas for more aggressive American-led rescue measures seem all the more futile given the failures to reach a consensus on the country's own immigration problems, made vivid in the simmering debate over policing the border with Mexico and calls by a leading Republican presidential candidate to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. ""Even if there were a green light from the Russians and the Chinese, the appetite for yet another military adventure in Syria is very, very limited among the American public,"" said Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow and expert on international institutions at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""I think in this case, the administration is correct, the situation is so incredibly complex among the combatants, there's very little evidence that United States or Western intervention would make anything better. ""That choice has certain moral consequences, and those moral consequences include vast suffering of the people in Syria, and now in them striking out, at least in the case of refugees, for Europe,"" Mr. Patrick said, adding that the crisis was ""largely Europe's responsibility."" The United States has long been the world's largest donor to the international programs that deliver the most direct assistance to refugees, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Refugee Organization, the World Food Program and others. Experts say that the international system of agencies, largely formed after World War II, still does excellent work but is now overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. Worldwide, some 60 million people are said to have been forcibly displaced, often by war, with some 19 million refugees, according to United Nations statistics. Each year, the United States grants residency permits to as many as 70,000 refugees from around the world, most referred by the United Nations refugee agency, which helps administer asylum requests. Only a small fraction of those have been Syrians, in part because the process typically takes up to two years, and the numbers of Syrians referred to the United States only began to increase after the start of the war four years ago. While the State Department has said it plans to increase the number, to perhaps 1,800 by next year, it would be of little more than symbolic value given the more than four million Syrians in need of shelter. Taking in 65,000 Syrians, as the 14 senators had urged, is virtually impossible under the existing asylum process, which requires lengthy background checks. The small number has opened up the United States to charges of hypocrisy as it has implored European allies to accept more. But Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, who just returned from a trip to Europe, said he found America's allies there unable so far to coordinate an effective response. ""It is incumbent on the United States to be of greater assistance, yes, but the Europeans also have a responsibility here,"" Mr. Dent said. ""Our European partners have a much harder time exercising leadership. They don't want the refugees. They don't want the migrants. At the same time, I don't know what they are prepared to do to bring about greater stability in the countries where there are problems.""  Mr. Dent said he found Europe divided by regional interests.  ""Angela Merkel is willing to accept more, but she is unhappy that other countries aren't willing to accept more,"" he said of the German chancellor's pledge to welcome more refugees. ""But what I was hearing in Poland and Lithuania is they aren't focused on this southern crisis at all. They are completely fixated on the Russian threat.""  Within the Obama administration there has been intense discussion about additional action, including the possibility of a major announcement tied to Pope Francis' visit to Washington this month. But beyond providing additional funds, experts on refugee issues say, the United States' options are limited. The United States Navy's Sixth Fleet, which has responsibility for the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic and most of Africa, could deploy rescue ships to help ease the perilous crossings that have led to so many deaths at sea. And there is precedent for the Navy to intervene in the migrant crisis: In 2013, a Navy crew rescued more than 100 Somali migrants from a raft in the central Mediterranean, taking them aboard the amphibious transport dock ship San Antonio. The men were taken to the Maltese Grand Harbor and turned over to the coast guard of Malta. But in the current circumstances, there is no consensus yet among European nations about where migrants rescued in the Mediterranean should be brought to shore. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who signed the letter urging Mr. Obama to accept more Syrian refugees, said there was little attention then, other than from critics, but that the photographs of recent days seemed to raise awareness.  ""It is horrifying,"" Ms. Klobuchar said of the picture of a drowned toddler in Turkey. ""But it is something that we anticipated and that's why we wrote this letter. We knew of the mounting problem for the humanitarian issues, the moral issues.""  Still, she said she understood the political climate. ""I am not naïve about this. I don't know that there is the political will right now to increase the numbers,"" she said. ""But you never know when it might happen.""  Eric P. Schwartz, a former assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, who is now dean of the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, said presidential leadership would help drive public response. ""The folks who lead our humanitarian work in the government are the best in the world, but you need the president of the United States and the secretary of state, but the president in particular, to speak out about our responsibilities here and to define the challenge,"" he said.  Increasing the number of Syrians granted asylum by 50,000 on an emergency basis would also help, he said, by sending ""an extremely powerful signal to Europe and to the world."" Samuel R. Berger, a former national security adviser for President Bill Clinton and now a consultant on international affairs at the Albright Stonebridge Group, said that greater media attention during the Balkan wars of the 1990s had helped raise awareness about the plight of refugees.

2839,1355426776.xml,"       Last month in Paris, Ken Hu, the acting chief executive of Huawei, told a group of journalists that the fast-growing Chinese maker of telecommunications network equipment had not come to France to supplant Alcatel-Lucent in its home market. ""Actually in France, this market is quite developed and Huawei and Alcatel can coexist, just like in China,"" Mr. Hu said at a hotel in the Trocadéro neighborhood. ""I don't want there to be a misunderstanding. We are not here to replace Alcatel. It would be like saying Alcatel is coming to China to replace Huawei."" A month later, on May 17, the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, accused Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE, of violating the antidumping and subsidies laws of the European Union. Mr. De Gucht, a Belgian lawyer, called for negotiations between the European Union and China to avoid an investigation that could lead to punitive customs duties. Now the two sides appear set to meet in an attempt to work out their differences. China has asked that Mr. De Gucht hold an informal meeting with its vice commerce minister, Zhong Shan, in Brussels on Monday, China's Ministry of Commerce and a European Union trade spokesman confirmed on Sunday. ""It appears that the commission is using the telecom equipment situation as some kind of a stick and bargaining chip against China,"" said Stuart Newman, an antidumping expert at the Foreign Trade Association, a Brussels group that represents European trade associations. Mr. Newman said the Europe-China trade relationship had become more difficult over the last two years, driven by disputes over solar panels and now, telecom equipment. The 27-nation European Union is China's biggest trading partner, the destination for Chinese exports worth 289.7 billion euros, or about $377 billion, last year. Last September, Mr. De Gucht opened an antidumping investigation of Chinese solar panel makers after receiving a complaint from a European industry association, EU ProSun. That investigation is set to end this year. The stakes in the solar panel dispute dwarf those of the telecom equipment makers. Last year, Chinese exports of solar panels and components to the European Union were roughly 21 billion euros, while shipments of telecom network gear were only about 1 billion euros, according to European Commission figures. China's commerce minister, Gao Hucheng, said in comments published on Sunday on the ministry's Web site that he hoped the disputes over photovoltaic and telecommunications products could be solved through talks.  A meeting on Sunday between the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also touched on the trade tensions. Both leaders emphasized their desire to resolve the dispute over solar tariffs, which Mr. Li said China considers dangerous to the global economy. ""These are measures that will flood into the neighboring countries, and are not useful to anyone,"" Mr. Li said. A person close to the European negotiating team played down the Chinese push for dialogue, saying the country's trade officials were maneuvering ahead of June 5, when Mr. De Gucht is expected to reveal the level of punitive tariffs that the European Commission intends to impose on Chinese solar panel makers. Serious negotiations with the Chinese will begin only after the commission publishes the customs duties, the person said. An important difference separates the telecom equipment and solar panel situations. For the telecom sector, formal legal proceedings have not yet begun, and an agreement between governments could head them off. On the solar panel case, antidumping and antisubsidy cases are already well along, greatly limiting the statutory authority of European officials to negotiate. Once the European Union announces the preliminary level of antidumping duties, then any deal would legally need to take the form of an offer by the Chinese industry, not the Chinese government. Hakan Wranne, an analyst at Swedbank in Stockholm, said Mr. De Gucht's accusations suggested that the commissioner believed he had a good case against Huawei and ZTE. ""I don't think he would be making these types of claims unless he felt he had solid evidence,"" Mr. Wranne said. But a prosecution of the Chinese telecom equipment makers could cost European rivals in terms of lost revenue in China, where the state-owned mobile operators are preparing for what may be multibillion-euro contracts to build the country's first fourth-generation high-speed networks. Mr. De Gucht said if talks with the Chinese did not bear fruit, he would pursue a case against Huawei and ZTE on the commission's own initiative, a rare ex officio proceeding, to protect European companies from potential retaliatory trade actions in China. Two of Europe's three big equipment makers, Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks, released statements saying that they opposed the European inquiries on free-trade grounds. ""Ericsson does not support this move by the commission,"" the Stockholm-based company said in its statement. ""Ericsson is a strong supporter of free trade, and we don't believe in this type of unilateral measure. Our policy is for open, free and unrestricted trade and global supply chains, benefiting users and societies."" Nokia Siemens, the Finnish-German venture, pointed out that it had also advised Mr. De Gucht in clear terms of its opposition. ""We absolutely oppose any efforts to restrict free trade and erect trade barriers of any kind and have urged the commission to refrain from taking such steps,"" Nokia Siemens said. ""We have made that position clear to the commission both verbally and in writing."" John Clancy, a spokesman for Mr. De Gucht, said the commissioner was not available for an interview and declined to comment on the statements of the telecom equipment makers. Unlike its peers, Alcatel-Lucent, a struggling French-American equipment maker that lost 339 million euros in the first quarter, released a statement urging the Europeans and Chinese to find a joint solution. The Paris-based company has had a subsidiary in China, a joint venture with a government partner called Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell, for three decades. ""We maintain the strong hope that the parties find a solution to benefit both the E.U. and its trading relationship with China,"" Alcatel-Lucent said. In France, opposition to perceived Chinese dumping has sparked discussion -- but no concrete proposal -- in Parliament for government to begin ""certifying"" network gear for the French market. During his visit to Paris, Mr. Hu, the Huawei executive, told a French reporter that such a proposal would only be fair if it applied to all companies, not just Huawei. ""It must be fair and equitable,"" he said. In China, a country that is on the verge of building one of the world's largest 4G networks, fair access to markets is also being pursued by Western equipment makers, whose shares of the Chinese market have declined with Huawei and ZTE's growth. China Mobile, the country's largest wireless operator, with 710 million customers, is considering whether to begin awarding the first 4G contracts this summer. The operator said it planned to build more than 200,000 base stations this year. China Mobile's domestic rivals, China Unicom and China Telecom, are also planning 4G networks. Mr. De Gucht has confronted Chinese telecom equipment makers before. In June 2010, a Belgian maker of 3G USB modems, Option, filed a complaint that accused Chinese rivals of dumping dongles in Europe. Mr. De Gucht's staff began to investigate the claims. But the case was halted five months later when Option withdrew its complaint after agreeing to license some technology to Huawei and sell the Chinese company a semiconductor business in a partnership agreement valued at 35 million euros. One European industry executive, who declined to speak publicly given the delicate state of the trade negotiations, said Mr. De Gucht may have been disappointed by the abrupt end to the case, which he had considered legally solid. Mr. Wranne, the Swedbank analyst, said the European trade commissioner and the Chinese may find a last-minute solution to avoid trade penalties. ""Huawei, ZTE and the commission have an interest in avoiding a broader trade dispute -- everyone does,"" Mr. Wranne said. ""But at this point, it could go either way."" Credit: KEVIN J.

295,2330268562.xml,"Queen Elizabeth II, whose public statements tend to avoid controversy or specifics, is expected to hint at the tumult for the royal family and the nation.LONDON -- Queen Elizabeth II has had a trying year.She will admit as much, it seems, in her annual, prerecorded message that will be broadcast on Christmas Day, when she will call 2019 ""quite bumpy,"" according to excerpts released on Tuesday by Buckingham Palace.Though it was not clear exactly what the queen was referring to, a quick overview of 2019 explains why it might have felt rough at times.In January, her husband, Prince Philip, apologized after he was involved in a car crash that left two women injured, sparking a public debate on older drivers. He agreed to relinquish his driver's license.In August, the queen was dragged into British politics when Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked her to suspend Parliament, a move that was later ruled unlawful by the country's Supreme Court.A few weeks later, her grandson Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, went public about their emotional struggles in a candid interview filmed during their official tour of Africa. The couple's environmental activism was questioned over their use of private jets, and Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, were unable to shake off headlines of a rumored rift in their relationship.But the biggest challenge for the royal family came in November, when Prince Andrew, the queen's second-oldest son, stepped down from his public duties after he gave a catastrophic interview to the BBC about his relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.""Quite bumpy"" sounds less awful than ""annus horribilis,"" as she once called 1992 -- the year when the marriages of three of her four children broke down, including that of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and fire damaged Windsor Castle. But her description of 2019 makes clear that it has been tougher than 2018, which she characterized in last year's Christmas broadcast simply as a ""busy year.""The bumps of 2019 have continued into the final days of the year. After the queen recorded her message, Prince Philip, 98, was admitted to a London hospital for what Buckingham Palace described as a precautionary measure to treat a pre-existing condition. He left on Tuesday, after spending four nights there.Though she is not expected to get into specifics in her address, the queen will focus on the importance of reconciliation -- a notion that could apply both to her family and to Britain. The country, which has just emerged from a general election, has been scarred by divisive politics surrounding the Brexit debate, including renewed calls for Scottish independence and concerns about weakened ties to Northern Ireland.The queen is to say that ""small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding,"" according to a statement from the palace.""The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference,"" she is to add.She is also to refer to the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which was commemorated in June by world leaders, including President Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, in a ceremony that the queen hosted in Portsmouth, a port city in southern England.As head of state, the British monarch is expected to remain publicly neutral on political matters, and the queen's addresses tend to be broad, anodyne and even a little opaque. Her talk this year of reconciliation between wartime ""sworn enemies"" could be taken as advice to political parties and opponents in the Brexit fight, as well as nations. (Jeremy Corbyn, the exiting leader of the opposition Labour Party, suggested earlier this month that he does not usually watch the Christmas address.)""By being willing to put past differences behind us and move forward together, we honor the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost,"" she is to say.The BBC is scheduled to broadcast her Christmas address at 3 p.m. local time on Christmas Day.It was filmed in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, with the queen sitting at a desk decorated by family photographs, a picture released by the palace shows. Prince Harry, Meghan and their 7-month-old son, Archie, were nowhere to be seen -- an absence that is sure to be parsed by the British tabloids, which are always eager to seize on a hint of dissension among the royals.The couple will also be absent from the royal Christmas at Sandringham House, the queen's country estate in Norfolk, England, as they are spending the holidays in Canada. They shared their Christmas card on social media on Tuesday.Michael Wolgelenter contributed reporting.Queen Elizabeth II recorded her Christmas broadcast at Windsor Castle.

2039,1446866041.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  The nation's top spymaster said on Tuesday that the White House had long been aware in general terms of the National Security Agency's overseas eavesdropping, stoutly defending the agency's intelligence-gathering methods and suggesting possible divisions within the Obama administration. The official, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, testified before the House Intelligence Committee that the N.S.A. had kept senior officials in the National Security Council informed of surveillance it was conducting in foreign countries. He did not specifically say whether President Obama was told of these spying efforts, but he appeared to challenge assertions in recent days that the White House had been in the dark about some of the agency's practices. Mr. Clapper and the agency's director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, vigorously rejected suggestions that the agency was a rogue institution, trawling for information on ordinary citizens and leaders of America's closest allies, without the knowledge of its Washington overseers. Their testimony came amid mounting questions about how the N.S.A. collects information overseas, with Republicans and Democrats calling for a congressional review, lawmakers introducing a bill that would curb its activities and Mr. Obama poised to impose his own constraints, particularly on monitoring the leaders of friendly nations. At the same time, current and former American intelligence officials say there is a growing sense of anger with the White House for what they see as attempts to pin the blame for the controversy squarely on them. General Alexander said news media reports that the N.S.A. had vacuumed up tens of millions of telephone calls in France, Italy and Spain were ""completely false."" That data, he said, is at least partly collected by the intelligence services of those countries and provided to the N.S.A. Still, both he and Mr. Clapper said that spying on foreign leaders -- even those of allies -- was a basic tenet of intelligence tradecraft and had gone on for decades. European countries, Mr. Clapper said, routinely seek to listen in on the conversations of American leaders. ""Some of this reminds me of the classic movie 'Casablanca' -- 'My God, there's gambling going on here,' "" Mr. Clapper said, twisting the line from the movie uttered by a corrupt French official who feigns outrage at the very activity in which he avidly partakes. Asked whether the White House knows about the N.S.A.'s intelligence-gathering, including on foreign leaders, Mr. Clapper said, ""They can and do."" But, he added, ""I have to say that that does not extend down to the level of detail. We're talking about a huge enterprise here, with thousands and thousands of individual requirements."" The White House has faced criticism for the N.S.A.'s surveillance practices since the first revelations by a former agency contractor, Edward J. Snowden, in June. But in recent weeks it has struggled to quell a new diplomatic storm over reports that the agency monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for more than a decade. White House officials said that the president did not know of that surveillance, but that he has told Ms. Merkel that the United States is not monitoring her phone now and would not in the future. On Wednesday, a delegation of senior German officials is scheduled to meet at the White House with Mr. Clapper, the president's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice; his homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco; and other officials. Several current and former American officials said that presidents and their senior national security advisers have long known about which foreign leaders the United States spied on. ""It would be unusual for the White House senior staff not to know the exact source and method of collection,"" said Michael Allen, a National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration and a former staff director for the House Intelligence Committee. ""That information helps a policy maker assess the reliability of the intelligence."" Mr. Allen, the author of book about intelligence reform called ""Blinking Red,"" said this information often comes to the president during preparation for phone calls or meetings with the foreign leaders.  The White House declined to discuss intelligence policies, pending the completion of a review of intelligence-gathering practices that will be completed in December. But a senior administration official noted that the vast majority of intelligence that made it into Mr. Obama's daily intelligence briefings focused on potential threats, from Al Qaeda plots to Iran's nuclear program. ""These are front-burner, first-tier issues,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ""He's not getting many briefings on intelligence about Germany."" Another senior administration official said that Mr. Obama did not generally rely on intelligence reports to prepare for meetings or phone calls with Ms. Merkel. ""He knows her well, he speaks with her regularly and our governments work together every day on a wide range of issues,"" said this official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic concerns. ""Because we talk so frequently, we know where they stand and they know where we stand on most issues."" Mr. Clapper and General Alexander got a warm reception from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, who defended the N.S.A.'s methods and said he had been adequately briefed about its activities.  But elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the outrage among America's allies was clearly fueling concern. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and one of the fiercest defenders of American surveillance operations, said Monday that she did ""not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers."" Ms. Feinstein said her committee would be conducting a ""major review"" of the intelligence programs. Another strong defender of the N.S.A., Speaker John A. Boehner, agreed that ""there needs to be review, there ought to be review and it ought to be thorough,"" he said. ""We've got obligations to the American people to keep them safe. We've got obligations to our allies around the world."" ""But having said that, we've got to find the right balance here,"" he added. ""We're imbalanced as we stand here."" An aide to Mr. Boehner said, ""The speaker still believes our surveillance programs save lives, but the president needs to do a better job of managing and explaining them."" On Tuesday, House Democrats and Republicans introduced a bill that would curb some of the N.S.A.'s practices, including the bulk collection of telephone data inside the United States. ""The picture drawn is one of a surveillance system run amok,"" said Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, a sponsor of the bill. ""Our intelligence community has operated without proper congressional oversight or regard for Americans' privacy and civil liberties."" Even on the House Intelligence Committee, members sparred over what they had been told by the intelligence agencies about eavesdropping on foreign leaders. Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat and a senior member of the committee, said that he had first learned about the practice after the recent news media reports.  ""Would you consider that a wiretap of a leader of an allied country would be a significant intelligence activity requiring a report to the intelligence committees?"" Mr. Schiff asked Mr. Clapper.  Mr. Clapper said the agencies had ""lived up to the letter and spirit of that requirement.""  Mr. Schiff disagreed, saying that the agencies had much work to do ""to make sure we're getting the information we need."" He said that disclosures about such eavesdropping could create significant ""blowback.""  Mr. Rogers disputed Mr. Schiff's claim, saying that Mr. Schiff needed to take the time to educate himself about what the committee had been briefed on.  ""To make the case that somehow we are in the dark is mystifying to me,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""It is disingenuous to imply that this committee did not have a full and complete understanding of activities of the intelligence community as was directed under the national intelligence priority framework to include sources and methods.""

In an image provided by the museum, restoration work performed on Vermeer’s “Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window” at the Dresden State Art Collections in Germany. An image of Cupid was covered over in this painting for nearly 300 years(Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden via The New York Times)


DRESDEN, Germany — After nearly three centuries behind a layer of paint, a naked Cupid has surfaced in one of the world’s best-loved artworks, drastically altering the background of a quiet interior scene.
The plump, golden-locked god in Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window,” was revealed in a restoration project that Stephan Koja, director of the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden, Germany, described as “a detective story and an adventure.”
The painting is the focus of an exhibition at the gallery, opened Thursday by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, and running through Jan. 2. It is one of just 35 works definitively attributed to Vermeer: The Dresden show, called “Johannes Vermeer: On Reflection,” unites 10 of them alongside works by contemporaries from whom Vermeer learned, including Pieter de Hooch and Gerard ter Borch.
Ever since an X-ray of “Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window” was made more than 40 years ago, scholars have been aware of the Cupid, who stares out of a painting within the painting. The section, in the upper right of the canvas, was hidden under a rectangle of paint behind the girl’s head. But they had always assumed that Vermeer had erased the god himself.
So when curators at the Dresden State Art Collections, which oversees the Old Masters Picture Gallery, first decided to restore the painting in 2017, there were no plans to expose him. But the rectangle responded differently from the rest of the painting to a solvent that restorers used to remove the varnish, Koja said.
That suggested the paint contained different components from Vermeer’s, making it more likely that it was applied by another hand. The darker shade also suggested a later artist might have tried to match the original paint after it had darkened with age.
The museum appointed an advisory panel of Vermeer experts and restorers. The group agreed that removing microscopic samples from the painting for testing was justified — a decision, Koja said, not to be taken lightly. Analysis of the tiny fragments gave conclusive evidence that the Cupid was overpainted years — even decades — after Vermeer completed the work in the late 1650s, Koja said.
“We found a layer of varnish with dirt on top of it” that must have accumulated later, Koja added. “It was clear the top layer of paint wasn’t by Vermeer. It was a distortion by a foreign hand against the intention of the artist.”
After the expert panel gave the go-ahead, restorers exposed a strip beneath the painted rectangle, about half an inch wide. Not only was the brushwork on the Cupid unmistakably Vermeer’s, it was also still in excellent condition, Koja said.
“The results of the tests were so overwhelming that it was clear what we had to do,” he said. The panel agreed that Christoph Schölzel, a painting restorer at the Dresden museum, should expose the Cupid in full. Schölzel took a year and a half, working inch by inch with a scalpel and a steady hand under a microscope.
Koja said the painting had gained something, not only in terms of composition and color balance, but also with respect to its content. While the blush on the girl’s cheeks previously made clear that she was reading a love letter, the god of desire on the wall adds a message about the kind of love Vermeer might have meant. His Cupid is shown trampling on a mask, a symbol of deception, to show that love conquers deceit and dishonesty.
The picture-within-a-picture also connects the work to Vermeer’s later interior scenes, many of which portray figures by windows, flooded in light. These often capture a moment in which the subject is lost in thought, alone, sometimes in the middle of a domestic task. Paintings or maps on the walls behind them add to the viewer’s understanding of the characters’ inner life.

The same Cupid appears in three other Vermeer paintings, including “Young Woman Standing at a Virginal,” which is also in the Dresden show and is on loan from the National Gallery in London. But in this work, there is no mask crushed under Cupid’s foot — instead he holds what looks like a letter. In “Girl Interrupted at Her Music,” which the Frick Collection in New York has sent to Europe on loan for the first time for the Dresden show, the Cupid looms over the couple in the foreground, leaving no room for doubt about their thoughts.
It is likely that the Cupid was based on a real painting in Vermeer’s possession. An inventory of his estate, which included about 50 paintings, mentions “a Cupid.” While the painting has not been located or identified, the curators say they believe that it was probably a contemporary work by Dutch painter Caesar van Everdingen. (Another Cupid painting by that artist is on display in the Dresden exhibition.)

Some mysteries remain. It is not clear exactly who painted over the god — nor why, or when — although we know that other Vermeer paintings were altered by later generations to meet contemporary tastes.

The discovery has also prompted speculation about another of his works, “Woman With a Pearl Necklace,” which is in the collection of the Berlin State Museums.
The woman in that painting, dressed in yellow trimmed with ermine, stands in front of a mirror, her fingers on the ribbons at either end of the necklace, in a moment of quiet introspection. Behind her is a stark white wall. Analysis has shown that a map hanging on the wall was painted over — but by whom?
Uta Neidhardt, chief restorer for Dutch painting in the Dresden State Art Collections, said it could have been done by Vermeer himself, but added, “Our colleagues in Berlin are bound to face a lot of questions.”
Koja said that the Dresden team would be happy to assist if curators in Berlin decided to investigate more closely. But Katja Kleinert, the official responsible for 17th-century Dutch and Flemish painting at the Berlin State Museums, said that analysis conducted less than two decades ago showed that the map — unlike the Dresden Cupid — was never painted to completion.
“It was only sketched,” she said. “We are pretty sure our wall was painted by Vermeer.”

900,434337387.xml,"      Greece skirted disaster this week by persuading investors and politicians that it is finally on track to fix its finances. But even before the dust settles, the government is setting the stage for a potential conflict with Germany, France and other European governments that may raise doubts about the sustainability of the euro project.    In the last two days, Greece's finance minister has threatened to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout if Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other European politicians resist pledging aid to help Greece cope with its newfound frugality. Asking the fund for help could create a new round of financial and political turmoil by sending the message that Europe cannot resolve its own problems, analysts said.   ""It would be damaging for the euro zone going forward because it would sow seeds of doubt about whether this is really a currency union, or just a group of countries that share a currency,"" said Simon Tilford, the chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London.    Policy makers and leaders of many countries that use the euro see Greece's troubles as a problem within the family. They want a homegrown political solution to show that Europe can fix internal economic crises without outside help.    Turning to the I.M.F., which often helps struggling emerging-market nations, is seen as a stigma that is to be avoided, a concern underscored by the European Central Bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, on Wednesday. ""I do not trust that it would be appropriate to have the introduction of the I.M.F. as a supplier of help,"" he said.    No member of the euro zone has had to borrow from the I.M.F. since the official use of the common currency began in 1999, and no major industrialized country in Europe has done so since Britain in 1976.    But from Greece's perspective, the I.M.F. would force the government to swallow nearly the same bitter medicine that Germany, France and others have required -- but at least Athens would receive guaranteed financial aid from the I.M.F. in return.    In addition, it is not  clear that Germany and other European governments seeking to contain the crisis have the resources or expertise to monitor Greece and other profligate euro members for the many years that it will take for the troubles to blow over. And if Greece has to refinance more and more of its debt in the coming months, the crisis could intensify.   ""It's a black eye for the euro zone if one of their members has to turn to the I.M.F. for support,"" Randall W. Stone, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, said. ""That's embarrassing. On the other hand, it's potentially more damaging to create a precedent for the rich European countries to bail out the poorer ones when they get into financial trouble.""   Greece's game of brinkmanship may well bring the I.M.F. to its doorstep.  ""I think the I.M.F. is going to get called in before the end of the day,"" Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and former I.M.F. chief economist, said in a phone interview from Germany. ""Greece's austerity plan is like a New Year's resolution. It's not going to be easy to enforce.""    For Greek leaders facing wide civil unrest, including the unions' occupation of  the country's finance ministry on Thursday, the threat of turning to the I.M.F. can serve useful ends.    ""People like to blame the I.M.F. for the policies they impose, but in many cases these are policies the governments know they have to push through,"" said James Raymond Vreeland, a political scientist at Georgetown University. ""They use the leverage of the I.M.F. so it's a little more politically palatable.""   But even setting aside the symbolic implications, some experts believe that an I.M.F. bailout would deeply rattle the markets.   Despite the reassuring bond sale on Thursday, investors could quickly drive up Greece's borrowing costs if they come to believe an I.M.F. intervention is likely, said Michael L. Mussa, a former I.M.F. research director who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.   ""The market is expecting other Europeans to do something,"" Mr. Mussa said. ""If that expectation is disappointed, I don't see how they're going to resolve the crisis.""    The biggest challenge is in Germany, which has historically tended to enforce fiscal and economic rectitude on its neighbors. Many German taxpayers are vehemently opposed to paying for the profligacy of their free-spending neighbors in Greece and other southern European countries that let their deficits soar sky-high instead of taming them when times were good.    At the same time, German banks also underwrite much of the Continent's debt and exert considerable influence in domestic politics, according to Mark S. Copelovitch, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Germany ""doesn't want its banking sector to go under because Greece has defaulted,"" he said.   Yet nightly broadcasts of widespread strikes in Greece, and accusations by some in Athens that Germany owes Greece for inadequate reparations paid out after the Second World War, have some Germans thinking that intervention by the I.M.F. may be worth the trouble.    ""In Germany, the public might favor an I.M.F. intervention if it reduced Greece's reliance on German funds,"" said Justin Vaisse, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.    European power struggles are also at stake. Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former I.M.F. chief economist, said  that Germany has long sought to have a German lead the European Central Bank, and an I.M.F. intervention could be seen as tarnishing Germany's credibility.     Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, views Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F. leader and a former French finance minister, as a political rival, and would be loath  to give him a perceived victory.   For weeks, the I.M.F. has tried to say as little as possible about Greece other than to state that it stands ready to help. Mr. Stone said that strategy seems the wisest for now. ""The only thing worse than announcing an I.M.F. program is announcing that maybe you're going to have one,"" he said.

1673,2131761781.xml,"PARIS -- Dozens of leaders from around the globe marched in the soaking rain down the Champs Élysée on Sunday, expressing solidarity for an international order that had its origins in the end of a world war 100 years ago, an order now under increasing pressure on both sides of the Atlantic.Only after these leaders arrived by foot at the Arc de Triomphe did President Trump show up, protected from the rain as he made an individual entrance. A few minutes later, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia did the same.For Mr. Trump, at least, the separate arrival was attributed to security concerns. But somehow it felt apt that these two leaders would not arrive with the crowd.No one has done more to break up the postwar global system in the last couple of years than Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. As the anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I was commemorated on Sunday, Mr. Trump's brand of ""America First"" nationalism was rebuked from the podium while he sat stone-faced and unmoved, alienated from some of America's strongest allies, including his French hosts.But while he may have been out of step with many of the leaders gathered around him, Mr. Trump remains at the vanguard of forces that are redefining the Western political paradigm in countries like Poland, Hungary, Italy and Turkey. In Britain and Germany, two of the Continent's major powers, nationalist movements have upended the establishment.So a ceremony meant to celebrate the ties that bind the world today in effect showcased the divisions that are pulling it apart.""Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,"" President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a speech at the Arc de Triomphe, welcoming the leaders and extolling an old system now under siege. ""Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying: 'Our interest first. Who cares about the others?""'Recalling the forces that led to World War I, Mr. Macron warned that ""the old demons"" have been resurfacing and declared that ""giving into the fascination for withdrawal, isolationism, violence and domination would be a grave error that future generations would very rightly make us responsible for.""Mr. Trump, who recently declared himself ""a nationalist,"" appeared grim as he listened to the speech through an earpiece and clapped only tepidly afterward. He had no speaking role and made no mention of the issues Mr. Macron raised during an address later at a cemetery for American soldiers killed in the war.The ceremony led by Mr. Macron encapsulated the tension in the international arena as Mr. Trump seeks to rewrite the rules that have governed the world in recent decades. He has abandoned international agreements on trade, nuclear proliferation and climate change, and disparaged alliances like NATO and the European Union.On the campaign trail this fall, Mr. Trump railed against what he called the ""rule of corrupt, power-hungry globalists,"" as he put it at a rally in Houston. ""You know what a globalist is, right? You know what a globalist is? A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what? We can't have that.""Mr. Macron has now, in effect, given a rebuttal. In addition to the speech, he also used an interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN that aired Sunday to define himself as ""a patriot"" rather than a ""nationalist.""""I do defend my country,"" Mr. Macron said. ""I do believe that we have a strong identity. But I'm a strong believer in cooperation between the different peoples, and I'm a strong believer of the fact that this cooperation is good for everybody, where the nationalists are sometimes much more based on a unilateral approach and the law of the strongest, which is not my case.""Despite the friction with Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump's views have been embraced by other Western leaders, some of whom, like Viktor Orban in Hungary, have made an anti-immigrant stance the keystone of their policy.""He's not isolated,"" said Bruce Jentleson, a scholar at Duke University, citing nationalist politicians across Europe. ""They've all benefited from him as precedent."" Other leaders have even adopted and adapted Trump phrases like ""fake news"" and ""America First"" for their countries.But, Mr. Jentleson said, it ""mostly gives him second-tier players like Poland, Hungary, Italy, and not the big guys like Germany and France.""And even some of those nationalists do not favor unraveling the world order entirely so much as changing the rules, as with President Xi Jinping of China or the Europeans who want better arrangements within the European Union, not a departure from it.Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for Europe, said Mr. Trump's nationalism did not reflect a consensus even within his own administration, which still has senior officials with a more traditional internationalist outlook.""The danger to the world is not that Trump will lead the nationalists, sweeping them to remake the world in an ugly, pre-1914 image or a dystopian counter-world of the U.S. siding with the fascists in World War II,"" he said. ""The danger is that Trump may take the U.S. out of the game -- à la the interwar period -- long enough for one of the serious nationalists, Putin or Xi, to do major damage.""Aside from the discord with the French president, Mr. Trump's two-day visit to Paris was marred by his decision on Saturday to scrap a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at the foot of the hill where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought. Aides cited the rain in canceling a helicopter flight, but it went over badly in Europe.Mr. Trump had another chance to pay respects to the war dead on Sunday at the Suresnes American Cemetery outside Paris, where 1,565 American soldiers are buried. Speaking in a drenching rain, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the soldiers and praised Franco-American relations, largely sticking to his prepared text without responding to Mr. Macron.""The American and French patriots of World War I embodied the timeless virtues of our two republics -- honor and courage, strength and valor, love and loyalty, grace and glory,"" he said after visiting a field of white crosses. ""It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago.""In contrast to the stiff interactions with the American president, Mr. Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, representing two nations that were once bitter enemies, demonstrated the close friendship that has emerged from the rubble of war. In appearances over the weekend, the French and German leaders -- who are facing their own political struggles at home -- appeared affectionate, and Mr. Macron on Saturday posted a picture of the two holding hands along with the single word ""Unis,"" or ""United.""Mr. Putin, on the other hand, seemed focused on Mr. Trump, approaching him at the Arc de Triomphe, shaking his hand and giving a friendly pat on the arm. The two later chatted briefly at a lunch for all the visiting leaders, according to the Kremlin, but will wait for a formal meeting until later this month, when both will be in Buenos Aires for a Group of 20 summit meeting.In marking the centennial of the armistice, Mr. Macron said that from the ashes of that war and the next one came hope. ""This hope is called the European Union, a union freely entered into, never before seen in history, a union that has freed us of our civil wars,"" he said.Yet absent from the ceremony was the prime minister of Britain, which is currently in the throes of trying to detach itself from the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May attended her own country's commemorations on Sunday, although she made a point of visiting France and Belgium on Friday to lay wreaths at the graves of soldiers killed in the war.Among the leaders present on Sunday were Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, King Felipe VI of Spain, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and dozens of others.The ceremony, in some measure Franco-centric by dint of being held in Paris, made a palpable effort to reach out to other countries that lost hundreds of thousands of people.While the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, opened the ceremony, the most moving moments came when high school students in yellow scarves read century-old letters from eight men and women who either fought or lived through World War I, sticking to the language in which they were written, including English, French and German.After the ceremony and subsequent lunch, Mr. Macron opened the Paris Peace Forum, a three-day conference to discuss fostering multilateralism. ""History will retain an image -- that of 84 chiefs of state and of governments united,"" he declared.""What is uncertain for the future is how this image will be interpreted,"" he continued. ""Will it be a ringing symbol of a durable peace among nations or the photograph of the last moment of unity before the world goes down in new disorder?""Mr. Trump was not there to help answer that question. He skipped the forum and headed back to the United States.Follow Peter Baker and Alissa Rubin on Twitter: @peterbakernyt and @alissanyt.Led by President Emmanuel Macron of France, world leaders marched down the Champs-Élysées in Paris on Sunday to mark the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I.

2181,914750484.xml,"      Last week's stock rally was extended on Monday, as European leaders discussed shoring up the euro and investors awaited the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season.   Measures of industrial, energy and financial shares had the biggest sector gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Shares of Alcoa, the aluminum producer, rose almost 3 percent before the company reported its quarterly results after the markets closed. Broadcom rallied 2.5 percent after Deutsche Bank said soft fourth-quarter results for chip makers created a buying opportunity for the industry.   The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.2 percent to 1,280.70. Last week, the gauge gained 1.6 percent, the second-best start of a year since 2006. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 32.77 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,392.69. The Nasdaq composite index closed up 2.34 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,676.56.   ""We'll see some earnings growth this year, but not a lot,"" said Kevin Caron, a market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in Florham Park, N.J. ""As long as U.S. fundamentals continue to move in a positive direction and as long as investors are comforted by the actions taken to maintain liquidity in Europe, the markets will be more complacent.""   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France sought on Monday to devise a plan for rescuing the euro over the next three months. Euro zone leaders may complete their new budget rule book by Jan. 30, one month ahead of schedule, and they are considering accelerating capital contributions to the bailout fund being set up this year to stem the debt crisis.   American corporations ended 2011 with the slowest profit growth in two years as the mending economy was met by a European slump that vexed companies reliant on global sales. S.& P. 500 companies, which beat analysts' estimates in the previous 11 quarters, are forecast to report a 6 percent increase in per-share profit during the September-December period, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg.   American companies ""are the cleanest dirty shirt, but we have to ask the question to what extent are they being hit on revenue and to what extent can they continue to contain costs,"" Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pacific Investment Management Company, the world's largest manager of bond funds, said during an interview on Bloomberg Television.   The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1/32, to 100 13/32. The yield remained unchanged from Friday at 1.96 percent.    Alcoa, the first Dow company to announce results for the fourth quarter, rose 0.4 percent in after-hours trading after gaining 2.9 percent, to $9.43, in regular trading. After the market closed, Alcoa reported its first quarterly loss in more than two years, in part because of lower aluminum prices. The loss of 3 cents a share, excluding restructuring costs, matched the average projection from 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.   Other industrial companies also gained. Caterpillar added 1.4 percent to $97.10. Schlumberger advanced 1.5 percent to $68.82. Bank of America increased 1.5 percent to $6.27.    Semiconductor shares rallied after Deutsche Bank raised the industry to overweight from equal weight. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2 percent.   Netflix, the streaming movie and DVD-by-mail service, increased 13.8 percent to $98.18, for the biggest advance in the S.& P. 500. The company forecast that it would attract millions of subscribers within a few years to the Internet film and television service it started in Britain and Ireland on Monday.   Inhibitex, a biopharmaceutical firm, soared 140 percent, to $23.70, after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy it to increase its position in hepatitis C medicines.   Other hepatitis C drug developers also rallied. Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 percent to $9.66. Achillion Pharmaceuticals jumped 23 percent to $9.72.

2823,920030151.xml,"      BERLIN -- After weeks of protests, Romania's prime minister resigned Monday, the latest European leader to fall victim to a mood of public outrage over austerity measures and stagnant growth.   Thousands of Romanians took to the streets across the country last month to protest austerity measures. The prime minister, Emil Boc, said Monday that he was stepping down because it is important to preserve the stability of the country.   The president, Traian Basescu, immediately named the current justice minister, Catalin Predoiu, as interim prime minister. After a meeting on Monday afternoon with leaders from the main political parties, Mr. Basescu announced that he was nominating Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, a former foreign minister who now heads Romania's foreign-intelligence service, as Mr. Boc's replacement, pending parliamentary approval.   Mr. Basescu said negotiations would begin Tuesday for the appointment of a new government. ""The No. 1 priority of the government is the effort to improve the standard of living of the people,"" Mr. Basescu said. Romania is by many statistical measures the second-poorest member of the European Union.   Parliamentary elections were already scheduled for later this year, by law no later than November, and the government had fallen below 20 percent approval rating in recent opinion surveys.   The economy had begun growing again after a deep recession in 2009 and 2010, but Mr. Boc's popularity suffered after he raised taxes sharply and made steep cuts in government wages to comply with a rescue program from the International Monetary Fund. With his resignation, Mr. Boc joined leaders from around the European Union who have left office: in countries that have received bailouts, like Portugal, Greece and Ireland; in those on shaky ground like Spain and Italy; and in more fiscally stable countries like Finland, Denmark and Slovakia.   President Nicolas Sarkozy of France hopes to avoid seeing his name added to the list of ousted leaders when voters go to the polls this spring, but the public has shown a voracious appetite for political change as difficult economic conditions persist.   Even as Europe's attention remains focused on the debt negotiations in Athens and its repercussions for the euro, Mr. Boc's resignation served as a stark reminder of the troubles facing countries outside of the euro currency area. The Hungarian national airline, Malev, halted all flights Friday, as creditors began seizing its planes parked on foreign soil over unpaid debts. Hungary, which has also been the scene of large-scale demonstrations, is seeking further assistance from the International Monetary Fund.   Romania suffered a sharp reversal of fortune as the global financial crisis worsened and foreign lending tightened up. After the economy grew 7.3 percent in 2008, it shrank a painful 6.6 percent in 2009, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. The country was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Union in 2009 for emergency loans totaling $27 billion at the exchange rates at the time.   Unlike Hungary, however, which is also struggling to stabilize itself and has had bumpy negotiations with the I.M.F., Romania is ""on track"" in goals of improving economic growth while maintaining fiscal and financial stability, according to an assessment of the country's progress under the loan program released Sunday by staff members from the monetary fund, World Bank and European Union.   ""I don't anticipate the change in government would necessarily cause any major changes in that,"" said Jeffrey Franks, the fund's mission chief for Romania, in a telephone interview from Bucharest. ""The key focus is to maintain the hard-fought, hard-won economic stability that Romania has achieved at some considerable sacrifice in recent years.""   The fund had been in discussions with opposition as well as governing parties, and Mr. Franks said there was ""broad political support for the main issues in the program.""   Austerity has become a controversial topic in Europe as the debt crisis has worsened. From Greece to Ireland, opponents have criticized a philosophy pushed by Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel, for what they see as painful cutbacks in services and public employment to pay for bad decisions by financial institutions and mismanagement by governments. Many economists, particularly in the United States, argue that tightening spending at a time of stagnation or even outright recession only prevents robust recovery.   Mr. Franks said that the I.M.F. assistance provides a lifeline and gives countries like Romania more time to make necessary changes. ""In the end, for small countries like Romania, particularly emerging markets, the ability to run large fiscal deficits is constrained by the willingness of someone to lend,"" Mr. Franks said.   Political analysts said Mr. Boc's resignation did not come as a surprise. ""From a political point of view, the ruling coalition was already exhausted,"" said Dorel Sandor, a political analyst and consultant in Bucharest.   Mr. Sandor said that the demonstrations revealed a deep disappointment with all political parties and not just the government. ""The common people in the streets react against everybody,"" he said, ""and this could be a sign of real trouble for the political environment in Romania.""   Protests have continued over the past week, albeit on a smaller scale. Demonstrators said the resignation of a popular health official (which proved short-lived) and the proposed reform of the health care system only provided the spark for the protests, which quickly grew to reflect a broader discontent with their wages and pensions, with employment prospects and deep-seated corruption.   ""I took this decision to defuse the political and social situation in the country, but also in order not to lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering -- the economic stability of the country,"" Mr. Boc said.

1640,1027631228.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED ATHENS -- Only a month after Greece installed a new government, the country is facing renewed peril. Its official lenders are signaling a growing reluctance to keep paying the bills of the nearly bankrupt nation, even as the government is seeking more leniency on the terms of its multibillion-euro bailout.   Adding to the woes, there is little agreement within either side. The Greek government is itself a motley coalition of conservatives and Socialists, and the leaders of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, known as the troika, are increasingly divided among themselves. That is creating even more uncertainty as Greece and the rest of Europe head for yet another showdown, renewing doubts about how long Athens can remain within the euro zone.   Even as fears mount in Europe about the rapidly worsening situation in Spain, Greece's problems are far from solved. The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, is expected to make his first visit to Athens since 2009 on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras as the troika begins yet another assessment of how well the country has complied with a spate of harsh austerity measures imposed as the price for loans. Greece's lenders say they will not finance the country any further unless it meets its goals. But many experts say that the targets were never within reach and that pushing three increasingly weak Greek governments to comply has only profoundly damaged the economy.   ""We knew at the fund from the very beginning that this program was impossible to be implemented because we didn't have any -- any -- successful example,"" said Panagiotis Roumeliotis, a vice chairman at Piraeus Bank and a former finance minister who until January was Greece's representative to the International Monetary Fund. Because Greece is in the euro zone, he noted, the nation cannot devalue its currency to help improve its competitiveness as other countries subject to I.M.F. interventions almost always are encouraged to do.   At the same time, Mr. Roumeliotis and others note, the troika underestimated the negative effect its medicine would have on the Greek economy.   ""The argument that is used usually by the troika in order to criticize Greece -- and to ignore their mistakes -- is that the deep recession is because of the nonimplementation of the structural reforms,"" Mr. Roumeliotis said. While Athens has fallen woefully short on that front, he conceded, the bigger problem is that the severe cuts contributed to the downward spiral by decimating economic demand within Greece.   It remains to be seen whether the troika is prepared to force Greece to default. Much of the talk on both sides is aimed at extracting concessions in negotiations. But while Greece has been pushed to the edge before, it now appears to be running out of time because its European partners, however complicit in Greece's current plight, appear to be running out of patience.   On Monday, the European Commission reaffirmed that the next tranche of aid to Greece would probably not be disbursed until September, putting the country at greater risk of running out of money to pay salaries and pensions.   At the end of last week, the European Central Bank cut off a crucial source of cash for Greek banks, saying that it would stop accepting Greek government bonds as collateral for low-cost loans until the troika completes its report, which is not expected until late August at the earliest. Greek banks must now borrow from the Greek Central Bank at a higher interest rate, from a fund with limited means; if it runs out, Greece would have to start printing drachmas.   Mr. Samaras's government will try to persuade the lenders keeping it on life support that the targets they set are off base because Greece's economy keeps contracting as a result of the tax increases and spending and wage cuts mandated by the troika. Greece's economy shrank 3.5 percent in 2010 and 6.9 percent in 2011 and is expected to contract 7 percent this year, a decline reminiscent of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Unemployment is at 22.5 percent and expected to rise to 30 percent, while Greece's main retailers' association warned on Monday that sales were expected to drop 53 percent this year.   The original plan called for Greece to return to financing its debts on the open market in 2014, an idea that one European official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, now calls a ""fiction.""   Complicating matters is the fact that the troika's institutions have different mandates and constituencies. ""The troika is not one homogeneous bloc,"" said Guntram B. Wolff, the deputy director of Bruegel, a public policy research institute in Brussels. ""They have different views.""   Some experts say that the I.M.F. has been quietly pushing to ease the austerity terms while European leaders have mostly been trying to satisfy Germany's demands to keep Greece on a tight leash to persuade its own voters to support the bailouts.   In an interview, former Prime Minister George Papandreou, a Socialist who was in power when Greece asked for a bailout in 2010, said Athens was given nearly impossible targets at the outset because Germany wanted to send a message to other European countries of what could await them if they asked for the same, a reality now spreading across southern Europe.   ""There was the moral hazard idea: 'We can't give Greece money too cheaply,' "" Mr. Papandreou said. ""There was a sense: 'Punish them. We have to be careful that if we make it too easy for a bailout, others will want similar things.' ""   While Greek officials say they were set up for failure, the mood in Germany has grown less sympathetic and calls for a Greek exit from the euro zone have escalated. Alexander Dobrindt, the general secretary of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said provocatively on Monday that the Greek government should now pay half its wages and pensions ""in drachmas,"" Greece's former currency.   Meanwhile, Germany's economy minister, Philipp Rosler, said on television last weekend that ""for me, a Greek exit from the euro zone has long since ceased to be a frightening prospect.""   As Germans sharpen their statements, in Greece the cuts have come at a steep political cost: the more the economy contracts, the less consensus the government has to carry out the fundamental changes needed to help restart growth.   Despite the obstacles, Greece has made substantial strides. From 2009 to 2011, it slashed government spending before interest payments by 20 billion euros, or 18 percent -- a feat even Greece's critics concede would be challenging for any government. It is also expected to reduce the number of civil servants it had in 2009 -- 874,000 -- by more than 100,000 by the end of the year.   Today, the coalition is divided over how to identify an additional 11.5 billion euros in cuts from 2013 to 2014 without causing a total collapse in basic services. In the coming days, it is expected to announce the merging of state entities and cuts to social welfare payments. Athens has said it will not lay off state workers, but reduce them through attrition and early retirement. And it has set a ceiling of around 2,400 euros a month for pensions.   But some of the government's gain in reducing its deficit has come from not paying its bills to Greek companies, making things worse for the economy when thousands of such companies are going out of business.   ""A reform needs two things: time and trust,"" said Anna Diamantopoulou, a minister in the governments of Mr. Papandreou and Lucas Papademos. ""We needed time to persuade people, but we did not have it.""   ""If you want to restructure a small company, that takes two years,"" she added. ""Can you restructure a country in two years?""

1273,2376082522.xml,"While world leaders are at last speaking out about the gravity of the pandemic, their voices are less a choir than a cacophony, with the United States absent from its traditional conductor role.LONDON -- In Frankfurt, the president of the European Central Bank warned that the coronavirus could trigger an economic crash as dire as that of 2008. In Berlin, the German chancellor warned the virus could infect two-thirds of her country's population. In London, the British prime minister rolled out a nearly $40 billion rescue package to cushion his economy from the shock.As the toll of those afflicted by the virus continued to soar and financial markets from Tokyo to New York continued to swoon, world leaders are finally starting to find their voices about the gravity of what is now officially a pandemic.Yet it remains less a choir than a cacophony -- a dissonant babble of politicians all struggling, in their own way, to cope with the manifold challenges posed by the virus, from its crushing burden on hospitals and health care workers to its economic devastation and rising death toll.The choir also lacks a conductor, a role played through most of the post-World War II era by the United States.President Trump has failed to work with other leaders to fashion a common response, preferring to promote his border wall over the scientific advice of his own medical experts.In an Oval Office address on Wednesday night, he imposed a 30-day ban on travel from Europe to the United States, claiming, without evidence, that the European Union's lax initial response had brought more cases of the virus across the Atlantic, with ""a large number of new clusters"" seeded by travelers from the Continent.Mr. Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has taken to calling the contagion the ""Wuhan virus,"" vilifying the country where it originated and complicating efforts to coordinate a global response.The same denigration of science and urge to block outsiders has characterized leaders from China to Iran, as well as right-wing populists in Europe, which is sowing cynicism and leaving people uncertain of whom to believe. Far from trying to stamp out the virus, strongmen like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia have seized on the upheaval it is causing as cover for steps to consolidate their power.Yet it is too simple to lay all this at Mr. Trump's door, or on world leaders collectively. Part of the problem is simply the fiendish nature of the pathogen.Coronavirus has resisted the tools that countries have brought to bear against previous global scourges. Mysterious in its transmission and relentless in its spread, it has led countries to try wildly divergent responses. The lack of common standards on testing, on the cancellation of public gatherings and on quarantines have deepened the anxiety of people and eroded confidence in their leaders.The simultaneous shocks to supply and demand -- shuttered iPhone factories in China; empty gondolas in Venice; and passengers abandoning cruises, hotels and airlines everywhere else -- is a new phenomenon that may not respond to the weapons that governments wielded against the dislocation that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the financial crisis of 2008.""The nature of this crisis is qualitatively different than the one in 2008 because the traditional tools are not as effective,"" said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Even if the U.S. took a leadership role, the traditional playbook would not be all that relevant here.""Britain, for example, won praise for its robust economic response, which, in addition to billions of pounds for hospitals and workers sidelined by illness, included a sharp interest rate cut by the Bank of England.Yet stocks in London still tumbled, if not as steeply as on Wall Street, where investors brushed off Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's proposal to allow Americans to delay paying their income taxes, which he claimed would pump $200 billion into the economy.Mr. Trump's other big idea, a cut in the payroll tax, was pronounced a ""nonstarter"" by House Democrats, who scrambled instead to introduce legislation to provide financial help to patients, workers and families affected by the fast-moving epidemic and speed it to a House vote on Thursday.To Mr. Haass, the intense focus on limiting the economic blow was understandable, given the carnage in the markets, but premature. He said countries needed to put their energy into slowing and mitigating the spread of the virus before they embarked on fiscal programs to repair the economic damage.The trouble is that, with few exceptions, their efforts have been hapless. In the United States, the delay in developing coronavirus test kits and the scarcity of tests have made it impossible for officials, even weeks after the first cases appeared in the country, to get a true picture of the scale of the outbreak.In hard-hit Italy, quarrels broke out between politicians and medical experts over whether the authorities were testing too many people in Lombardy, inflating the infection figures and fueling panic in the public. Italy's response could be weakened further by the anti-vaccination movement that was once embraced by the populist Five Star Movement, which took power in the last government.Even comparing one country's case count with another's is almost impossible, given the different testing procedures and diagnostic criteria around the world, said Dr. Chris Smith, a specialist in virology at the University of Cambridge.In the most extreme example, China's case count skyrocketed when it began recording positives based on people's symptoms, rather than a on lab test, the method most countries are still using. But even lab tests might yield different results in different places, depending on the targets labs are using and the ways health workers collect and process specimens.""Different countries are doing different things,"" Dr. Smith said of the testing programs. ""You're not comparing apples to apples.""The rise of populism has exacerbated the problem by reducing the incentives of countries to cooperate. European leaders, in a three-hour teleconference on Tuesday night, agreed to set up a 25 billion euro investment fund, or $28.1 billion, and to relax rules governing airlines to curb the economic fallout.But they failed to overcome national objections to sharing medical equipment like face masks and respirators, given that health issues are the responsibility of national governments. Germany, the Czech Republic and other countries have tightened export restrictions on this gear to keep it for their own citizens.Chancellor Angela Merkel's warning that the virus would infect 60 percent to 70 percent of people in Germany -- a figure she attributed to the ""consensus among experts"" -- was the most forthright admission of the scale of the problem by any world leader. It was fully in character for a physicist-turned-politician, reinforcing her status as the liberal West's foil to Mr. Trump.""We will do whatever is needed,"" she said. ""We won't ask every day, 'What does this mean for our deficit?""'Yet even Ms. Merkel's position has been weakened by the resurgence of the far right in Germany. Germany rebuffed a request for medical equipment from Italy, only to see China offer the Italians an aid package that includes two million face masks and 100,000 respirators.In Britain, which left the European Union in January and was exempted from Mr. Trump's travel ban, there are already concerns the country will not have access to a vaccine, or will have to pay more for it than other European countries.Mr. Johnson's government, which won its recent election on a populist-inflected platform of ""Get Brexit Done,"" is now struggling with how to communicate the risks of the outbreak to its public.The Johnson government has put a lot of stock in a so-called nudge unit in Downing Street that specializes in behavioral psychology.

1521,433271225.xml,"      Russia's shutdown of natural gas lines to Ukraine lasted less than 48 hours, but the repercussions could last far longer in Western Europe, which also relies heavily on Russian gas. Even as the flow of gas to Germany, France and other countries resumed at normal levels by Tuesday evening, public officials and energy experts called on the Continent to rethink its energy policy. Russia's standoff with Ukraine has exposed a deep European dependence on Russia, the officials and experts said. To reduce that vulnerability, they said, Europe should seek out other gas suppliers and develop alternative fuels, like clean-burning coal, nuclear power and renewable energy. ''If Russia is prepared to run the risk of cutting off supplies to its neighbors if they have a disagreement, how reliable are they as a supplier?'' said William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the International Energy Agency, which advises 26 industrialized nations. ''You have to ask the question.'' Russia is virtually the sole supplier of gas to large swaths of Central and Eastern Europe, and to close neighbors like Finland. France and Italy buy between a quarter and a third of their imported gas from Russia. In Germany, which is by far Russia's largest customer and has made energy the cornerstone of a broad economic alliance with Moscow, some experts said the standoff might even have political implications. ''Germany's alliance with Russia was not just conceived as a commercial deal, but as a way to integrate Russia into Europe,'' said Alexander Rahr, a Russia expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. ''This could be in jeopardy if the gas dispute continues.'' The European Union, he said, is likely to rush to Ukraine's defense in its dispute with Russia over gas prices, giving Germany little choice but to fall in line. And Russia can no longer count on the friendship between President Vladimir V. Putin and Gerhard Schroder, who stepped down as German chancellor in November. Mr. Schroder's successor, Angela Merkel, has not commented publicly on the dispute between Moscow and Kiev. But her economics minister, Michael Glos, said Monday that Germany would increase its Russian gas purchases only if Moscow proved itself to be a dependable supplier. Mr. Glos also rekindled a debate over Germany's larger energy policy, saying the new government ought to reconsider the Schroder government's plan to phase out nuclear power by 2021. Mrs. Merkel supports extending the life of Germany's nuclear plants. But during negotiations to form a government, she was unable to persuade the Social Democrats with whom she shares power to shelve the planned phase-out, which had been championed by Mr. Schroder's coalition partner, the Green Party. ''The latest developments show how important it is to draw on a balanced, broad energy mix,'' Mr. Glos said in a statement on Monday. In a radio interview, he added, ''The German nuclear power plants were doomed by the Red-Green coalition to be switched off only for political reasons.'' Some experts predicted that Russia's recent actions would strengthen Mrs. Merkel's hand. Germany imports more than 40 percent of its gas from Russia, and within hours of the shutdown, the largest German supplier, E.ON Ruhrgas, said it was not getting its normal amounts of gas. ''We understand that Russia cannot continue to subsidize Ukraine with very cheap gas, given rising market prices,'' the company's chairman, Burckhard Bergmann, said in a statement. ''But it is also important to raise prices to the international market level in steps that Ukraine can cope with.'' Mr. Bergmann's careful tone is not surprising, given his company's complex ties with Russia. Ruhrgas owns a stake in Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, in addition to being one of its main customers. It is also a partner with Gazprom in a $4.7 billion project to build a pipeline from Russia, under the Baltic Sea, to Germany and other parts of Western Europe. Mr. Schroder brokered that deal with Mr. Putin shortly before he left office. He later accepted a job as the chairman of the board of a Russian-German consortium that is building the pipeline -- a decision that drew withering criticism from across the political spectrum here. Experts note that the energy alliance between Germany and Russia originated under Helmut Kohl, Mrs. Merkel's political mentor, not Mr. Schroder -- a fact the chancellor is sure to recall when she visits Moscow this month. She is unlikely to derail an arrangement that has profited both nations. ''She might tell them when she goes there about the mess one can make by using energy as a political tool,'' said Mr. Rahr. ''But she will do nothing to question the energy alliance between Germany and Russia.'' Other experts argue that the European Union should negotiate an agreement with Russia that guarantees fair prices to all its members. Otherwise, there will be further disputes like this one. While many here said they welcomed a debate over energy policy, some worried that it would be limited to perennial topics like nuclear power rather than forward-looking issues, like renewable energy. Ukraine, for example, has the most potential of any European country to generate energy from crops, grasses and trees, often referred to as biomass, because of its rich soil and low population density, according to Hermann Scheer, president of the European Association for Renewable Energy. ''Those who prolong the current energy system are simply provoking things like the gas dispute,'' he said.  ",2006-01-04
1017,1760421779.xml,"       Of the 4.5 million people who have fled the Syrian war, only 2,647 have been taken in by the United States. Why do we make it so hard for them to get here? ""WE AREN'T the kind of family that sends our daughters to work,"" Mahmoud al-Haj Ali told me one evening this fall. He'd just returned to the family's dingy second-floor apartment in Aurora, Ill., from the warehouse where he and his 19-year-old daughter, Sham, sorted boxes. At work, Mahmoud tried to keep her in sight. ""I saw how tired she was,"" he continued. ""It's more than she can take."" Sham's English classes provided only a shaky foundation in the language, and she struggled to negotiate basic conversations. Mahmoud also spoke little English - we were sitting with an interpreter - but he could manage the essential. Mahmoud work tomorrow, Mahmoud no work tomorrow, he said in self-parody. But he, too, was tired. He rolled up his sweatpants to reveal a swollen leg. In Syria, Mahmoud, 57, who once owned a flourishing locksmith business in the Emirates, would have already retired. ""We didn't expect it to be so expensive,"" he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. ""What can we do?"" The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn't enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan. Mahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh's bedroom and found the bill for the family's airfare: $6,130. ""Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,"" he said. Most nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis' sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they're twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren't. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot. Now, collapsed on the couch, the twins scrolled through homemade videos of Ahmad strolling around their new neighborhood in sunglasses and found footage showing the rubble of their hometown, 6,000 miles away. The al-Haj Ali family comes from Khirbet Ghazaleh, a town of 16,000. It is 15 miles from Daraa, where the revolution against Assad began, in 2011, after his security forces arrested and tortured a group of students for writing antigovernment slogans. The al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government's ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad's forces. Then the airstrikes began. Government security forces raided the family's home dozens of times. Their cousins, who lived next door, were imprisoned and tortured. Still, the al-Haj Alis hung on; they adapted to living in a war zone, spending evenings in the dark. Then, one morning in August 2012, they learned from a television news report that Azizeh's brother, a high-ranking official in Assad's military, had defected overnight to Jordan. His family would most likely be punished, with death, in his stead. He hadn't warned them. He couldn't: His phone was bugged, and sending a message would only have further endangered them. The al-Haj Alis never slept at home again. Within days, they left Syria for Jordan by car. Azizeh feared they'd be unable to make it across the border and was even more terrified that the names of her family members would be on a blacklist and that they would be arrested. Mahmoud handed their keys to a neighbor whose house had been flattened by airstrikes. ""If we're not back by sunset,"" he told her, ""you can have our house."" The war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Netherlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem. The al-Haj Alis worry he may never make it to Aurora. The family had been in Illinois for eight months when ISIS attacked in Paris, killing 130 people. Early reports claimed that one of the terrorists made his way to Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee. European countries imposed new border restrictions, and 31 American governors, including the governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, called for a moratorium on Syrian refugees. In December, when a militant couple shot up a center for the disabled in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and earning accolades from ISIS, the rhetoric grew more vociferous. A store clerk was shot in Michigan, a Somali restaurant was set ablaze in North Dakota and anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked around the United States. Azizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now. The al-Haj Alis are five of the 2,647 Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the United States, roughly 0.06 percent of the more than 4.5 million driven from the country since the uprising began in 2011. The scale of the crisis is such that of the 20 million refugees flooding the world today, one in four is Syrian. Although President Obama has committed to bringing at least 10,000 more Syrians to the United States by this October, that number is still a trickle compared with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's effort to resettle 25,000 in Canada; Chancellor Angela Merkel's acceptance of nearly 93,000 in Germany last fall; and President François Hollande's promise to bring 30,000 more Syrian refugees to France over the next two years. Why has the United States taken so few? ""It's extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee - the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,"" says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria's continuing war - what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as ""the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict."" Until recently, Syria's refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria's neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months. McDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. ""It's important to the president's view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we're doing our part,"" McDonough told me recently. Paris threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one militant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria's civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood. Republican presidential candidates seized on the Syrian refugee issue as proof that Obama wasn't keeping Americans safe. Dr. Ben Carson conflated Syrian refugees with ""rabid dogs."" Jeb Bush called for deprioritizing Muslim refugees from the Middle East in favor of Christians. Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment, proclaiming that Muslims should be sent to ""Muslim-majority"" countries while ""Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them."" Donald Trump upped the ante by calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. In November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown. In the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. ""Every phone call I've had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I've underscored that we recognize the fear,"" McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to ""send a message"" to ""the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing - mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people."" The Syrian crisis is often described as a crisis of migration, but that's not how it began. ""This exodus didn't come out of nowhere,"" says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, senior adviser for the Syrian American Medical Society. The war in Syria has left some 250,000 people dead and displaced millions. And Syrian-American activists often refer to it as Obama's Rwanda. ""From Day 1 of the Syrian catastrophe,"" says Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of the organization People Demand Change, ""the U.S. started signing checks to the U.N., but they missed the point."" The point, he said, is ending the war, not creating a welfare state made up of refugees. ""It's not a zero-sum choice,"" Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama's national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. ""We're working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,"" he said, ""but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?"" For millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. ""The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,"" Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria's neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live ""between Iraq and a hard place."") Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups. Resettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. ""This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,"" Blinken said. ""Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families - we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists."" In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece. The refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. ""These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they're in tin boxes in the desert,"" says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. ""It's not a pull factor that makes them move, it's a push factor,"" says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. ""If there isn't a means to survive here, they will go,"" she went on. ""Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die."" Waseem al-Haj Ali and his wife, Noorhan, keep two blue suitcases packed in the apartment they once shared with their family in Amman. ""It's a nightmare,"" Waseem said on a recent evening. ""There's no future here in Jordan. I can't even get a driver's license."" In exasperation, he raised his eyebrows, bushy like his father's. The apartment's peeling walls were covered in blue and purple flowers, drawn by his brother Ahmad before he left for America. Early last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cultural-orientation classes - which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and privacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. ""Arizona is like the gulf,"" she recalled learning. ""Hot, dry and full of snakes."" Ten days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn't go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem's parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn't sure his parents could make it without him. ""I'm trying to be patient for my parents,"" he said. ""If it weren't for them, I would've already left."" ""If we don't get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we'll leave for Europe,"" he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn't swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have? ""We think only about traveling,"" he said. ""All we want is to go the United States."" Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. ""We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,"" Noorhan said. ""That's it. We don't want a palace or some luxury life."" When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn't dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refugees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. ""My father used to be a wealthy man,"" Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud's locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone. Among Syrian refugees, ""on hold"" is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem's case ""is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."" Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant's security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem's name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, ""recurrent vetting"" raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: ""If you have an 800 credit score and you're good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card."" Or maybe it was Azizeh's brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. ""I'm not looking for beauty or history,"" he said. ""I'm looking for a country with human rights and freedom."" Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh's brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support - which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride - to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States. As months passed with no answers, Waseem turned over the strange questions he was asked during his final interview. Could these hold the key to the predicament in which he now found himself? Did he intend to commit terrorism in the United States? No. Did he intend to visit a prostitute in the United States? No. Refugees often refer to questions like the last one as ""the crazy questions,"" a senior immigration official told me: queries that, by law, immigration officials must ask to determine grounds of inadmissibility, even though they're anachronistic. Others include Are you a member of the Nazi Party? and Are you a habitual drunkard? The system of vetting refugees was first overhauled after Sept. 11. Since then, America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and conflicts in Africa and Asia have led to further refinements in how the United States evaluates refugees. Since 2007, for instance, the Defense Department has worked with the Homeland Security Department to share its intelligence on Iraqis, who represent one of the largest influxes of refugees to the United States in the last decade (more than 85,000 since 2008). Many won the right to apply for admission to the United States after risking their lives to aid American soldiers. Yet, as these Iraqis began to arrive, opposition to resettling them was swift. It began, for the most part, with fringe groups. Ann Corcoran, a conservative from rural Maryland, started a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch, in which she chronicles news related to Muslims and others arriving in the United States. She warns that Muslims are coming to build ""cities within cities"" and to establish Shariah law in America. Corcoran told me that in Iowa last spring, she handed her book, ""Refugee Resettlement and Hijra to America,"" directly to Donald Trump. Resettling refugees isn't a perfect process. ""No immigration program is completely without risk,"" a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. ""We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,"" Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, ""We are the opposite of stove-piped - we're incredibly networked."" One common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she's interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren't considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals. In addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They're also experts in country-of-origin information. ""Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,"" one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. ""We detect lies based on what's happened in the country of origin. It's not just hour-by-hour events; it's ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom - we know what their dresses look like."" U.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable to percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or ""deprioritized"" include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family. Syrians, like other refugees, don't choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. ""We're not a labor department,"" a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. ""If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don't encourage that."" All of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant's entire family visits the State Department's Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes. This fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. ""ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,"" says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. ""The threat is real."" Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. ""We don't leave holes, and we don't take chances,"" Richard told me. ""If there's any doubt about someone, they don't come."" Indeed, as León Rodríguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering ""based on their showing up in the databases."" (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of ""national security concern."") Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-IIaj Ali family, says, ""You'd have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way."" After the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on ""circuit rides"" - traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States. ""Just having an interview doesn't sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,"" Richard says. ""First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they're caught lying, then they're not going to make it, no matter how worthy."" At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, ""on hold."" From Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. ""How are you?"" he asked. He hadn't anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins' school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn't sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad's security forces; they could face American high school. ""Oh,"" Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father. ""The worst thing is this game of waiting,"" Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. ""It kills your soul."" The situation unfolding at West Aurora High wasn't quite as Azizeh understood it. Ron Murphy, an assistant principal of operations at the high school, explained that yes, the Aurora police were called in as a precaution (Mohamed even snapped a selfie with an officer). But it had nothing to do with the boys. After a student tweeted his support for Trump and Trump's stance on immigration, a Twitter war broke out. Even though there was no credible threat, the school took steps to reassure parents and defuse the situation. More than half of the school's population is Hispanic. The issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class. Outside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor's opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government. In Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syrian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus - a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem, and through which one of the attackers had entered the country legally. In January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming ceasefire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. ""We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,"" Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. ""Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,"" Kirk said. ""Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe."" One winter afternoon, not long after the incident at the boys' school, Azizeh nursed a cup of tea and talked bleakly of the family's future. What if the governor had the power to keep Waseem out of Illinois? And if he couldn't come, what would they do? Then there were the boys. ""I'm worried someone will target them,"" she said. She also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn't eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. ""That's too expensive,"" Sham said. ""It would take too many years."" To secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately. After picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. ""Problem, problem, problem,"" she said, pointing to her daughter's bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes. In a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse. The family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn't cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market. School was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home. For a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family's homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base? If Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now - either killed by the Assad government's barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt. Issam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem's unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. ""Depression in kids doesn't look like sadness,"" Smeir said. ""It looks like restlessness and anger."" The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag - the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband. ""Students ask about what Syria was like before the war,"" Ahmad said at home after work one evening. ""We say it was beautiful. It's kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria."" That day at school, during their first-period English class, their reading-comprehension portion involved a lesson about Cappadocia, Turkey, where people built an underground city to protect themselves during invasions. Afterward, the teacher handed out work sheets quizzing the kids on what they had learned. Why did people in Turkey live underground? The answer was B: to hide from their enemies. But Ahmad circled C: to live. Three days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. ""After all the news,"" she wrote, ""we have no hope to travel to America."" 'It's extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee - the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better.' 'We think only about traveling. All we want is to go the United States.' 'It's kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria.' Eliza Griswold is a writer based in New York. While on assignment for the magazine, she has covered the exodus of Christians from the Middle East, poetry in Afghanistan, fracking in Western Pennsylvania, Special Operations troops in Africa and more.

""The al-Haj Ali family welcomed me graciously around the world once their mother, Azizeh, vetted me,"" Griswold said. ""It felt like a sad kind of 'Where's Waldo?' - I could go anywhere to visit Azizeh's children, yet she isn't sure she'll see them again.""  ",2016-01-24
356,434092842.xml,"      The House passed legislation on Friday intended to address global warming and transform the way the nation produces and uses energy.   The vote was the first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change. The legislation, which passed despite deep divisions among Democrats, could lead to profound changes in many sectors of the economy, including electric power generation, agriculture, manufacturing and construction.   The bill's passage, by 219 to 212, with 44 Democrats voting against it, also established a marker for the United States when international negotiations on a new climate change treaty begin later this year.    At the heart of the legislation is a cap-and-trade system that sets a limit on overall emissions of heat-trapping gases while allowing utilities, manufacturers and other emitters to trade pollution permits, or allowances, among themselves. The cap would grow tighter over the years, pushing up the price of emissions and presumably driving industry to find cleaner ways of making energy.   President Obama hailed the House passage of the bill as ""a bold and necessary step."" He said in a statement that he looked forward to Senate action that would send a bill to his desk ""so that we can say, at long last, that this was the moment when we decided to confront America's energy challenge and reclaim America's future.""   Mr. Obama had lobbied wavering lawmakers in recent days, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore had made personal appeals to dozens of fence-sitters.   As difficult as House passage proved, it is just the beginning of the energy and climate debate in Congress. The issue now moves to the Senate, where political divisions and regional differences are even more stark.   Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, a co-sponsor of the bill, called the vote a ""decisive and historic action"" that would position the United States as a leader in energy efficiency and technology.    But the legislation, a patchwork of compromises, falls far short of what many European governments and environmentalists have said is needed to avert the worst effects of global warming. And it pitted liberal Democrats from the East and West Coasts against more conservative Democrats from areas dependent on coal for electricity and on heavy manufacturing for jobs.    While some environmentalists enthusiastically supported the legislation, others, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, opposed it. Industry officials were split, with the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers opposing the bill and some of the nation's biggest corporations, including Dow Chemical and Ford, backing it.    Republican leaders called the legislation a national energy tax and predicted that those who voted for the measure would pay a heavy price at the polls next year.   ""No matter how you doctor it or tailor it,"" said Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, ""it is a tax.""   Only eight Republicans voted for the bill, which runs to more than 1,300 pages.   Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, stalled the vote by using his privilege as a party leader to consume just over an hour by reading from a 300-page amendment added in the early hours of Friday.    Apart from its domestic implications, the legislation represents a first step toward measurable cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that administration officials can point to when the United States joins other nations in negotiating a new global climate change treaty later this year. For nearly 20 years, the United States has resisted mandatory limits on heat-trapping emissions.   The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was in Washington on Friday to meet with Mr. Obama, strongly endorsed the bill even though it fell short of European goals for reducing the emissions of heat-trapping gases.   Mrs. Merkel, a longtime advocate of strong curbs on emissions, has been pushing the United States to take a leading role before the climate negotiations, set for December in Copenhagen.   After meeting with Mr. Obama, she said she had seen a ""sea change"" in the United States on climate policy that she could not have imagined a year ago when President George W. Bush was in office.    The House legislation reflects a series of concessions necessary to attract the support of Democrats from different regions and with different ideologies. In the months of horse-trading before the vote Friday, the bill's targets for emissions of heat-trapping gases were weakened, its mandate for renewable electricity was scaled back, and incentives for industries were sweetened.   The bill's sponsors were making deals on the House floor right up until the time of the vote. They set aside money for new energy research and a hurricane study center in Florida.   The final bill has a goal of reducing greenhouse gases in the United States to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by midcentury.   When the program is scheduled to begin, in 2012, the estimated price of a permit to emit a ton of carbon dioxide will be about $13. That is projected to rise steadily as emission limits come down, but the bill contains a provision to prevent costs from rising too quickly in any one year.   The bill would grant a majority of the permits free in the early years of the program, to keep costs low. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the average American household would pay an additional $175 a year in energy costs by 2020 as a result of the provision, while the poorest households would receive rebates that would lower their annual energy costs by $40.    Several House members expressed concern about the market to be created in carbon allowances, saying it posed the same risks as those in markets in other kinds of derivatives. Regulation of such markets would be divided among the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.    The bill also sets a national standard of 20 percent for the production of renewable electricity by 2020, although a third of that could be met with efficiency measures rather than renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal power.   It also devotes billions of dollars to new energy projects and subsidies for low-carbon agricultural practices, research on cleaner coal and electric vehicle development.   Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming, posted an appeal on his blog for passage of the legislation.   ""This bill doesn't solve every problem,"" Mr. Gore said, ""but passage today means that we build momentum for the debate coming up in the Senate and negotiations for the treaty talks in December which will put in place a global solution to the climate crisis. There is no backup plan.""   The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, with Representative Henry A. Waxman, Left, and Representative Edward J. Markey After the Vote.

3198,878805500.xml,"      BERLIN -- The latest bailout in the Greek rescue has all the elements of what is fast becoming almost commonplace European intrigue.   The French president arranges a private summit meeting with the German chancellor. Europe's top central banker resists calls to allow Greece to write off some debt, fearing it could undermine the euro. The Greeks cry out that their sovereignty is infringed.   And only when markets teeter toward panic is a deal finally reached in Brussels to stave off more attacks on the euro zone's vulnerable southern countries and prevent, for the moment at least, a broader run on financial markets.   The dramatic elements in the latest round of messy European compromise are not in themselves new. The question is whether the deal reached Thursday for another Greek bailout, this time valued at $157 billion, and relief for Portugal and Ireland is a decisive step to calm Europe's financial storm or simply postpones another reckoning for the weakest southern European economies and the euro itself.   The consensus emerging is that European leaders went farther than ever before, crossing even their own red lines to shelter their decade-old currency. But many also worry that the intensive bargaining necessary to make an agreement possible resulted in a weak accord, saving face for all the key parties.    Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, an economic research institution in Brussels, said Thursday's meeting ""clarifies the horizon and pushes it forward."" But relief was not the same as solutions, Mr. Pisani-Ferry said, adding that he thought the private sector had not made enough concessions for the long run. Greece is almost sure to need further debt restructuring, he said.   The deal involved delicate compromises from all parties, especially Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the European Central Bank. Each gave something and could claim a prize as well. The Europeans eased the burden on Greece, gave a modest bill to the private financial institutions and empowered a European-wide fund to act more broadly to buy up bad debt. The moves seemed to appease the markets, for now.   Babis Papadimitriou, an analyst for the Kathimerini newspaper in Greece, warned that its government had not shown great skill at putting into effect measures it had approved, including the opening up of closed professions and the privatization of over $70 billion in state assets.   The issues are political as much as economic. European democracy is fraught with the complications of 27 member nations, 17 of which use the euro, plus European institutions with shifting responsibilities. It was all on display in this crisis -- internal German politics, the qualms of the European Central Bank, the plight of the Greeks and market anxieties over Italy and Spain, which are too big to bail out.   The biggest sticking point in reaching a broader accord to relieve Greece of some of its crippling burden of debt is Germany, where Mrs. Merkel has steadfastly resisted using European resources -- meaning the wealth of Germany and other relatively prosperous members of the union -- to write down Greek debt. Past bailouts provided new loans to Greece to help it pay off old ones, but ultimately just added to the country's overall debt load.    But as markets swooned again this past week, pressure mounted in Germany. Even members of her own party attacked her with a ferocity unseen during the slowly unfolding crisis, saying she was jeopardizing European unity. President Obama called Mrs. Merkel on Tuesday to remind her how fragile the world financial system had become and of Germany's responsibility.   Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, was also pressed to consider steps he had previously insisted were impossible. On Wednesday, he called the bank's 23-member governing council together in the bank's high-rise headquarters in Frankfurt to discuss allowing the first default by a country that uses the euro.   Though staunchly opposed to compelling private banks to share the costs on Greece, which would mean at least a partial default in the eyes of bond rating agencies, the members of the bank council recognized that Germany was determined that any new bailout involve some pain for the private sector. But the council would insist on several conditions. European countries must guarantee Greek bonds so they will remain eligible as collateral for central bank lending. The bloc must support Greek banks and step up assistance for Greece's economy.    And if private investors took losses on their holdings of Greek debt, that step must not been seen as a precedent that might be extended to other nations like Ireland or Portugal. ""It should be unique,"" said a bank official.   President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was described as worried that Mrs. Merkel might not even attend the meeting Thursday. They had spoken by phone in what he described as a ""sterile"" conversation. He decided to fly to Berlin Wednesday afternoon.    ""I need to deploy my energy,"" Mr. Sarkozy told his cabinet before leaving, ""but at the same time I need to not hurt anyone's feelings.""   After negotiating all afternoon and into the night, they were joined around 10 p.m. by Mr. Trichet, who had come from Frankfurt, and a call was placed to Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council. The meeting ended past midnight.    A possible deal had been reached, but Mr. Trichet left looking unhappy, as the French daily newspaper Le Monde reported. He had been cajoled into accepting the possibility of a selective default, meaning an organized write-down of some debt.    Everyone had to give something up. Mr. Sarkozy let go of his plan to tax banks to pay for bailout funds. Mrs. Merkel accepted a reinforcement and expansion of the region's rescue fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility. The fund would be allowed to buy sovereign debt on the secondary market and from the European Central Bank.   The fund would also stand ready to inject new capital into troubled European banks. It would be instructed to tender its loans at a wholesale price, with none of the punitive extra interest Mrs. Merkel once favored.    The fund would begin to look like a European monetary fund, making all euro zone taxpayers responsible for guaranteeing most of the debts of countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland. German officials and voters were cool to the idea. But not as wary as the austerity-beaten Greeks to further deep spending cuts.   The 20-member Greek delegation arrived the day before the meeting with significant apprehension. Until Thursday evening they were not sure they would get a deal. Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, met with Josef Ackermann, chief of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the International Institute of Finance, the international bank group.    Mr. Ackermann acted as an intermediary between politicians and bankers, knowing it was impossible ""to bring this package through Parliament without private sector participation,"" as he told German television.   Mr. Ackermann's involvement helped clear the way for big private banks to accept a modest write-down on the value of their Greek bonds. And a meeting over Gummi bears, cookies and a thermos of coffee between Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Sarkozy and George A. Papandreou, prime minister of Greece, opened the door to a broader agreement that other European nations might accept.    After opening statements at the Thursday summit, Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the crisis had not been handled correctly. ""We should have solved some of these issues before,"" he said, according to a senior European Commission official.    But a diplomat said the financial stakes seemed higher this time. Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy ""were speaking with one voice,"" the diplomat said.    The Dutch and Finnish delegations inserted language demanding that the Greeks secure loans with buildings, land and companies slated for privatization. ""We are a sovereign country, not a company,"" said one member of the Greek delegation. ""It was very insulting."" Mr. Papandreou made it clear that would create a political crisis at home, possibly prompting the government's fall.    In the end, no one emerged with all demands met, but no one emerged an obvious loser, either.   Mrs. Merkel won contributions from private banks she desperately wanted, but let the euro zone slide closer to the sort of economic government that German taxpayers abhor. Her shift reflected growing panic at home that her dithering had endangered the European integration project central to German policy since the end of World War II.   While the European Central Bank conceded on private sector participation and the prospect of a selective default on Greek debt, the bank achieved its goal of tightening euro area fiscal discipline and shifting responsibility for supporting Greece to European countries. The pact also allows the European stability fund to buy European government debt in open markets, relieving the central bank of that task.    Mr. Sarkozy, for his part, hailed the new powers for the stability fund as ""the initiation of a European monetary fund,"" a longstanding French goal.   As she faced reporters in Berlin Friday, Mrs. Merkel seemed confident. ""All of Europe has undertaken reforms that a year and a half ago would not have been conceivable,"" she said, pointing to the higher retirement age in Spain, the sale of state-owned assets in Greece, savings packages in Ireland and Italy and even a new commitment in France to bring down its budget deficits.    ""You have to tackle the problem at the root,"" she said.

463,1807205636.xml,"       Berlin -- Four attacks in a week have left Germany anxious. On July 18, a teenage refugee attacked passengers on a train near Würzburg with an ax and a knife. Three days later, an 18-year-old shot and killed nine people in Munich. And two days after that, a Syrian refugee killed his girlfriend and co-worker at a kebab shop in Reutlingen, a few hours before another Syrian refugee detonated a bomb in Ansbach, killing himself and wounding 15. In terms of motivation, the attacks came from all directions. The Würzburg and Ansbach attackers claimed allegiance to the Islamic State, while the Munich killer said he wanted to copy the Norwegian right-wing extremist and mass murderer Anders Breivik. All of this has Germans reeling. What kind of extremism poses the greater danger to Germany -- the Islamic State, or the German far right? Are we safer as a globally engaged society, or should we isolate ourselves? It had been a tough year for Germany already. After welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees, we started 2016 with the dozens of  sexual assaults outside Cologne's main train station on New Year's Eve, followed a few months later by surprising gains by the anti-refugee, far-right Alternative for Germany party in state elections. And the past week's events add to an existing climate of anxiety. Fear of terrorism was already at a high: 73 percent of Germans surveyed in April and May said they feared terrorism, the first time the issue took first place on the list of Germany's leading concerns since the survey began 20 years ago. Though the Würzburg attack came first, it was the Munich attack that changed everything. It took hours for the police to find the killer. Rumors flew of other attacks around the city; its 1.5 million residents were told to stay indoors; trains were diverted, as if Munich was under quarantine. That evening, the entire country was transfixed with fear, glued to their TVs or cellphones. The fact that the death toll stayed in the single digits is irrelevant; the experience, the collective fear, will stick with us. The Alternative for Germany party was quick to link the attack to Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy. On Friday night, long before the police had details on the Munich perpetrator's motives, a party leader tweeted: ""Merkel, thank you for terrorism in Europe."" When the police did release more information on the gunman on Saturday, stressing that they could find no ties to Islamist groups, there was a strange feeling of relief in the liberal corners of the social networks: Thank God, it was just a shooting rampage! The far right was wrong! But then a refugee detonated a bomb in Ansbach, and the narrative flipped again. The only simple truth after our week of horrors is that there is no simple truth. And yet it will clearly alter Germany's collective self-perception. We have joined the ranks of the victims of international terrorism. The shell that seemed to protect Germany from the horrors experienced by others -- by the United States and by so many countries in Europe, the Arab world and Asia -- is broken, if it ever existed. In an odd way, it's like a coming of age, a shedding of a child's illusion of being inviolable. But perhaps more so in Germany than any other country in Europe, the fear of terrorism isn't limited to the possible attacks themselves; it is about what our bête noire, the German far right, will do with it. We have already seen the political risks of xenophobia; the right-wing sentiments of the Munich attacker raise the possibility that xenophobic violence will escalate further. What it all adds up to, though, is a fear that the attacks will change the character of Germany itself, destroying the tolerant, cosmopolitan identity that we have assiduously built over decades, and that we cultivate as if it were a prize flower. Given our history, we have always been aware of its fragility; but in recent decades we have been more confident about our relatively new selves -- even, dare we say, proud of what Germany is today. Since the attacks, leaders from the centrist parties have been offering detailed suggestions for policy changes to counter terrorism, a desperate attempt to prove the ability of mainstream politics to respond. But however sensible their suggestions, none of them can compete with easy populist slogans like ""No asylum for Muslims"" or ""Shut the borders."" Rebuilding trust and fighting the rise of the new far right starts with blunt honesty, investigating the backgrounds of all attacks without political bias, whether they are Islamist or xenophobic. It also means being realistic: The only way to truly prevent such attacks is to renounce the freedom and openness that make modern Germany worth defending. Accepting that premise without accepting its conclusion is the greatest challenge facing us, and the West.

1023,1695932050.xml,"       In the end, after trying every possible tactic, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece threw in the towel and accepted the toughest demands yet made by creditors to extend life support for Greece and keep it in the eurozone. That may avert an immediate catastrophe, but there is little to celebrate since it will do little to address, much less repair, the slow-moving disaster of the Greek economy. The Greek Parliament has to approve the main portions of the package by Wednesday just to start negotiations on a new three-year bailout of up to 86 billion euros ($96 billion). Despite pleas from the Greeks for debt relief, the creditors gave only vague indications that they might consider easing terms on Greece's total debt of more than 300 billion euros, which it cannot possibly repay. Mr. Tsipras certainly didn't help his cause with the European leaders by calling for a confusing last-minute referendum, in which Greek voters rejected an earlier bailout deal. And now his capitulation has enraged members of his left-wing Syriza party, raising the possibility of another national election, with the attendant unknowns, or at least a thorough reshuffling of the government. The guiding notion behind the creation of the European Union was to resolve problems like this through consensus and cooperation. Instead, the final 17-hour negotiating session was marked by acrimony not only between Greece and the European leaders, but also between Germany and France; between the German finance minister and the head of the European Central Bank; between north and south, east and west. So the tragedy is not only that the Greek debt crisis has no end in sight, but that instead of the one-for-all-and-all-for-one ethic that was supposed to govern Europe, the rancorous talks showed a roomful of national leaders with sharply differing conceptions of what to do about a bankrupt fellow member. The Greek Parliament is likely to accept the deal, if only because there is no choice. Austerity will remain firmly in place, and the increased taxes and reduced pension payments imposed in the package will only further erode the demand that the Greek economy needs to avoid a deepening depression. The deal also requires that a fund be created to sell off public assets worth 50 billion euros to repay debts and recapitalize banks, a condition hard for a socialist government to swallow, and continued monitoring of Greece's adherence to bailout terms by the International Monetary Fund. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the one who should be most dedicated to European unity, declared after the deal was sealed that its ""advantages far outweigh the disadvantages."" The one advantage of the agreement reached early Monday is that it buys some time. But unless that time is used to discuss how to really reduce the Greek debt and restore its moribund economy to life, it will not be long before eurozone leaders are locked in another agonizing debate about what to do. Germany and its allies have driven a hard bargain, but in forcing Greece to submit they have not resolved the crisis of the monetary union or advanced the European project.

704,434043860.xml,"      Close on the heels of the pope's rehabilitation of a group of schismatic bishops, including one who denied the Holocaust, a second scandal has compounded a debate within the church over whether Pope Benedict XVI's focus on doctrine and his perceived  insensitivity to political tone are alienating mainstream Catholics and undermining the church's moral authority.    On Sunday, a priest known for such provocative statements as blaming the sins of New Orleanians for Hurricane Katrina asked the pope to rescind his appointment as an auxiliary bishop in Austria.    The affairs have engendered a storm of criticism of the church hierarchy and led to frantic efforts to mollify angry and confused parishioners around the globe, while the latest controversy has raised concerns that the actions could be part of a disturbing pattern.    The Vatican expert George Weigel, in a recent essay in First Things, an American religion journal, criticized the Vatican for its ""chaos, confusion and incompetence.""   In Vienna on Monday, 10 Austrian bishops convened a crisis session to deal with the fallout. Erich Leitenberger, a spokesman for the Vienna Archdiocese, said church officials around the country had been inundated with letters, phone calls and e-mail messages, including from parishioners saying they were leaving the church.   Austria, a majority-Catholic country with a complicated Nazi past, had been reeling from the pope's revocation of the excommunication of four schismatic bishops from the ultraconservative Society of St. Pius X, including Bishop Richard Williamson, who has denied the existence of the Nazi gas chambers as well as the scale and genocidal intent of the Holocaust.   While that firestorm was still raging, Benedict ignited another by appointing the Rev. Gerhard Maria Wagner, known for his Katrina comment and for saying that homosexuality was curable, as the auxiliary bishop of Linz.    Cardinal Christoph Schonborn, the highest ranking Catholic official in Austria, said Monday that the decisions about the schismatic bishops and Father Wagner were unrelated, and that they were ""made on different tracks."" But their proximity intensified the rancor among more reform-minded Austrian Catholics.   Mr. Leitenberger said, ""The displeasure grew exponentially.""   Outside St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, Elisabeth Felbermair, 28, said she was relieved that Father Wagner was stepping aside. ""Thank God he's going,"" she said, calling his views ""too reactionary."" She said she would probably leave the church, though for personal reasons not directly related to the controversies of recent weeks.   For many Catholics, the issues are larger than Father Wagner. As the Austrian newspaper Die Presse said on its front page on Monday, ""His name stands for a battle over direction: should Linz be more faithful to Rome or should the church be more democratic and more liberal?""   Likewise, the outrage over Bishop Williamson was directed not only at his Holocaust denial and the Vatican's delay in fully condemning it, but also over concerns by centrist Catholics about the direction of the church and their place within it.   Indeed, even as local churches have scrambled to reassure parishioners that the controversies were anomalous, others see Benedict's interest in reaching out to traditionalists as perfectly consistent with his past views.    A theologian more at home in the library than the stadium Mass, Benedict was for two decades head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and was more attuned to the theology of esoteric doctrinal questions rather than their potential political ramifications. If his recent missteps had unintended consequences, they have still demonstrated to many parishioners that his concerns are far removed from theirs.   ""We had to restore a lot of confidence to those who were upset, who needed to know that we recognize the concerns of many Catholics,"" said Msgr. Bernard Podvin, the spokesman for the French Bishops Conference. ""It's a very, very big job.""   Monsignor Podvin said the French Catholic hierarchy had been trying to explain that the values of the Society of St. Pius X did not represent the views of ""the Catholic community.""   The society was founded in 1970 by a French archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, in opposition to the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council, which included a commitment to religious liberty and a document absolving contemporary Jews of responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus.    The four schismatic bishops were excommunicated in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated them without a papal mandate. In revoking the excommunications, the pope sought to heal a lingering schism, seemingly oblivious to how it might play beyond the walls of the Vatican.    The most intense outrage came from Benedict's native Germany, where the Holocaust remains a third rail and its denial is a crime. Both Chancellor Angela Merkel and the German Catholic hierarchy have been fiercely outspoken in their criticism of the pope.    The Vatican later called on Bishop Williamson to recant and said that the pope had not known of his views at the time of the decision. Bishop Williamson has apologized for the ""media storm"" caused by his remarks, but not for their content.    In the United States, ""the outrage is coming not so much from the pews, but from the community of professional theologians who fear that by accepting the bishops of the Society of St. Pius X back into the church, the liturgical and theological reforms of Vatican II are somehow endangered,"" said the Rev. James Massa, the executive director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He called that fear ""an overreaction,"" noting that Benedict's ""whole career as a priest and scholar has been shaped by the council.""   In Mexico, another crisis is undermining confidence in the church: this month, the Legionaries of Christ, a conservative religious order, said that its founder, the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, had led a double life and fathered a child in an affair. Before his death last year at 87, Father Maciel was forced by the Vatican to leave his ministry after allegations that he had sexually abused seminarians.    In his criticism of the Vatican hierarchy, known as the curia, Mr. Weigel said a curia that allowed the Bishop Williamson controversy to explode was not ""a curia capable of conducting an investigation that can command public credibility.""   The quick decision by the Vatican to accept Father Wagner's withdrawal in Austria may reflect a new sensitivity to that concern and would not have been made lightly, says Hubert Feichtlbauer, an author in Vienna who writes about church issues. ""The Vatican really took a risk, and had to consider the possibility that other places might put up similar resistance to unwanted candidates,"" he said.    That risk may have been overridden by other concerns.   ""The larger problem is the inability of the church leadership to come to terms with the modern world,"" Mr. Feichtlbauer said. ""The problem is a long-term one,  and in no way is it solved.""   Credit: RACHEL DONADIO and NICHOLAS KULISH; Rachel Donadio reported from Rome, and Nicholas Kulish from Vienna.

4028,1467584916.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  A presidential advisory committee charged with examining the operations of the National Security Agency has concluded that a program to collect data on every phone call made in the United States should continue, though under broad new restraints that would be intended to increase privacy protections, according to officials with knowledge of the report's contents. The committee's report, the officials said, also argues in favor of codifying and publicly announcing the steps the United States will take to protect the privacy of foreign citizens whose telephone records, Internet communications or movements are collected by the N.S.A. But it is unclear how far that effort would go, and intelligence officials have argued strenuously that they should be under few restrictions when tapping the communications of non-Americans abroad, who do not have constitutional protections under the Fourth Amendment. The advisory group is also expected to recommend that senior White House officials, including the president, directly review the list of foreign leaders whose communications are routinely monitored by the N.S.A. President Obama recently apologized to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for the N.S.A.'s monitoring of her calls over the past decade, promising that the actions had been halted and would not resume. But he refused to make the same promise to the leaders of Mexico and Brazil. Administration officials say the White House has already taken over supervision of that program. ""We're not leaving it to Jim Clapper anymore,"" said one official, referring to the director of national intelligence, who appears to have been the highest official to review the programs regularly. But resistance from the intelligence agencies is likely. In an interview two months ago, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the soon-to-retire director of the N.S.A. and the commander of the military's Cyber Command, suggested that a major cutback in American spying on foreign nationals would be naïve. And officials who have examined the N.S.A.'s programs say they have been surprised at how infrequently the agency has been challenged to weigh the intelligence benefits of its foreign collection operations against the damage that could be done if the programs were exposed.  One of the expected recommendations is that the White House conduct a regular review of those collection activities, the way covert action by the C.I.A. is reviewed annually. Another likely recommendation, officials say, is the creation of an organization of legal advocates who, like public defenders, would argue against lawyers for the N.S.A. and other government organizations in front of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the nation's secret court that oversees the collection of telephone and Internet ""metadata"" and of wiretapping aimed at terrorism and espionage suspects. Mr. Obama has already hinted that he objects to the absence of any adversarial procedures in front of the court's judges. But even if the N.S.A.'s activities are curtailed, it may be hard to convince Americans -- or Germans, Mexicans and Brazilians -- that the agency's practices had changed. In part, that may depend on how much public transparency is built into programs that the government has spent years cloaking. The advisory report offers the first signs that the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who took thousands of documents from the agency's archives and has given some of them to news organizations, may lead to changes in the programs he exposed. While Mr. Snowden has been widely condemned in Washington for violating his oaths to protect secrets, and for taking up asylum in Russia instead of facing prosecution, it now appears likely that his disclosures will lead to the result he told interviewers he was seeking. Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss any specific recommendations of the panel. ""Our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that as we gather intelligence, we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies, and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world,"" she said. ""We need to ensure that our intelligence resources are most effectively supporting our foreign policy and national security objectives -- that we are more effectively weighing the risks and rewards of our activities."" She added that the review was especially focused on ""examining whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state; how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners; and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.""  The five-person advisory group of intelligence and legal experts, several of whom have long connections to Mr. Obama, is expected to deliver its lengthy, unclassified report to the White House by this weekend. Among its members are Richard A. Clarke, who served in the Clinton administration and both Bush administrations and has become an expert on digital conflict; Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A.; and Cass R. Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who served in the Obama White House and is married to Samantha Power, the ambassador to the United Nations. Two leading legal academics are also members: Peter Swire, an expert in privacy law, and Geoffrey R. Stone, a constitutional law expert and a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School, where Mr. Obama once taught.  Members of the advisory group have declined to talk about their recommendations until the report is published. But fragmentary accounts of their main conclusions have begun to seep out, as word has spread of a preliminary briefing they gave to Mr. Obama's top advisers. Two officials said that the advisers had gone further to challenge the intelligence agencies' ways of doing business than they had expected. ""There's going to be a lot of pushback to some of their ideas,"" said one person familiar with the contents, who declined to go into detail. Another said that the report was ""still being fine-tuned,"" and that elements of the recommendations may change. As a senator, Mr. Obama was critical of the Bush administration's efforts to extend the N.S.A.'s surveillance powers, but as president he has embraced most of the programs begun during Mr. Bush's time, including the bulk collection of telephone metadata. Only one major N.S.A. program, involving the bulk collection of metadata from about 1 percent of all emails sent inside the United States, is known to have been ended during Mr. Obama's presidency.  Once it is delivered to the White House, the report is expected to feed into another review being conducted by national security officials across the administration. Mr. Obama has indicated that he plans to announce a range of changes, though officials say that is not likely to happen until early next year. At some point, officials say, the advisory group's entire report will be made public. In an interview last week on MSNBC, Mr. Obama said, ""I'll be proposing some self-restraint on the N.S.A., and, you know, to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidence."" But he gave no details. Mr. Obama asked the advisory group to determine whether the N.S.A. had overreached, putting new programs in place because it had the technological capability, rather than weighing the costs to privacy. ""What's coming back is a report that says we can't dismantle these programs, but we need to change the way almost all of them operate,"" said one official familiar with the advisory group's instructions. So far, the intelligence agencies have largely opposed most proposals for major changes in the programs that they developed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. For example, General Alexander has told Congress that it would not be possible to dismantle the bulk collection of data about American telephone calls until there was an efficient way to search quickly for data held by communications companies like AT&T and Verizon. Many of those companies do not retain the information for more than 18 months, and say they do not want to take on the burden and legal liabilities of holding it longer. But General Alexander suggested in the interview two months ago that it may be several years before the United States can develop technology that would make it unnecessary for the government to amass that data in its own storage sites.

3513,2395146709.xml,"This much was clear on Monday: The path to reopening is confusing.Italy's prime minister outlined a plan to ease lockdown restrictions as the country recorded its fewest new coronavirus cases since March 10. New Zealand said retailers and restaurants could reopen on Tuesday and schoolchildren could go back to class, five weeks after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ""go hard and go early"" strategy that was credited with holding down infections.In the United States, Colorado, Minnesota and Mississippi joined the handful of states that have started to reopen their economies, and the Navy made plans for the hospital ship Comfort to leave New York after the last of its 182 patients was discharged.By contrast, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said his stay-at-home order ""will remain in effect until further notice,"" and governors in New Mexico and Hawaii have extended their stay-at-home orders through May. And in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, sounding strong but looking somewhat pale after having been out with the coronavirus himself, declared that lifting social-distancing measures would bring on ""not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster.""Other signs of the patchy ways in which the world was approaching emerging from lockdown: Switzerland, which brought down one of Europe's highest per capita rates of infection, allowed a limited number of businesses to reopen on Monday. Across the border in Germany, face masks became mandatory for passengers on public transportation and customers in many stores (but not in Berlin, which decided against requiring shoppers to wear them). Chancellor Angela Merkel and the 16 state governors are to meet again on May 6 to discuss any further loosening of the rules.Schoolchildren in Norway were back in class, and with barber shops free to reopen, the country's culture and health ministers both got haircuts. The culture minister, Abid Raja, said his wife had given him a trim during the lockdown because the facial recognition app on his cellphone ""almost didn't recognize me.""For all the attention on when and how to lift restrictions, one change was made quietly, so quietly it went unnoticed for nine days. On April 18, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added six possible symptoms of the coronavirus to its list, an update that acknowledged the unpredictability of the virus in individual patients. These are the new symptoms: chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell.Cautious Plans to Reopen New York and New JerseyGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Monday that 337 more people had died of the virus in the state, and Mr. Murphy reported an additional 106 deaths in New Jersey. New York and New Jersey together account for more than 40 percent of the cases in the United States. The one-day totals were less than half of what the two states reported at their peaks.Both governors have begun to offer details on reopening. Mr. Cuomo's order shutting down nonessential businesses in the state is scheduled to expire on May 15, and he said at his daily briefing that he would extend it in many parts of the state. He said in a radio interview later in the day that he hoped to decide this week whether schools could reopen before the end of the academic year. He said he would coordinate the decision with Mr. Murphy and Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut.At his own briefing, Mr. Murphy listed benchmarks that his state would have to clear to reopen. He also said the three states might not take exactly the same steps. ""But I think you'll see our steps harmonized,"" he said. That suggested that downstate New York, including New York City, and northern New Jersey would gear up again later than other areas.Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Murphy talked about hiring contact tracers -- Mr. Cuomo said as many as 7,000 might be needed to figure out who had crossed paths with infected patients in New York State. There is an app for that in Australia, which has had 6,700 cases and 83 deaths, and there were 1.1 million downloads in the first 12 hours it was available. The government said that about 10 million people would have to use the app for it to be effective.Mr. Cuomo also continued his attack on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who last week called federal aid for states hit by the coronavirus ""blue state bailouts"" and suggested those states should file for bankruptcy. Mr. Cuomo gave a shout-out to the governor of Mr. McConnell's home state, Kentucky, Andy Beshear, a Democrat who also took issue with Mr. McConnell, a Republican. ""It is hard for a governor, especially Andy, who is a relatively new governor, to stand up to a senior official and speak truth to power,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""That is hard. Takes guts. Takes courage.""Closing the StreetsSocial distancing takes space, more space than on the typical sidewalk, so New York City will close at least 40 miles of streets to vehicle traffic. The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, had been pressing for 75 miles' worth, which Mayor Bill de Blasio had resisted until Monday, when he announced a goal of 100 miles, still only a small fraction of the 6,000 miles of streets in the city. He said streets near or within parks would be blocked off first.New York is not the only city to close streets as automobile traffic has declined during the pandemic. For example, officials in Oakland, Calif., announced two weeks ago that they would limit 74 miles of streets to pedestrians and cyclists.Romania's Response: Millions in FinesIn some places, lockdown rules are enforced carefully -- and the price is high.Romania levied $95.5 million in fines for lockdown violations from March 24 to April 19, roughly what the country took in from its corporate profit tax in February. Romanians caught without a valid reason for being outside -- or without identification -- can be fined as much as 20,000 lei, or about $4,450. One violator was Mayor Robert S. Negoita of Bucharest's Sector 3, who was apprehended after cycling in a park. He argued that he had been inspecting the park, but the BBC reported that he was fined 10,000 lei.Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.",2020-04-28

The mathematician Ingrid Daubechies has pushed past limits, setbacks and bias to pioneer definitive work in digital image processing and data science - and make a path for women in the field. / By Siobhan Roberts / Photographs by Jeremy M. Lange

while preparing for a long research trip to Madagascar, the mathematician Ingrid Daubechies bought a 50-inch flat-screen TV for her husband, so he could invite friends over to watch Premier League soccer games. After setting it up, the couple turned on a match, and while Daubechies' husband, the mathematician and electrical engineer Robert Calderbank, became transfixed by the action, she got distracted. ""Oh, wow!"" she said. ""They use wavelets!""
Wavelets are versatile mathematical tools that can be thought of as a zoom lens, making it possible to spotlight the information that matters most in an image. The telltale signs of wavelets that Daubechies spotted were on the field, pixelating at larger scales, producing a fuzzy patchwork of green. ""Look here,"" she exclaimed. ""You can see artifacts in the grass.""
""Yes, yes,"" Calderbank replied. ""Who cares about the grass?"" He just wanted to watch the game.
A professor at Duke University, in Durham, N.C., Daubechies' métier is figuring out optimal ways to represent and analyze images and information. The great mathematical discovery of her early career, made in 1987 when she was 33, was the ""Daubechies wavelet."" Her work, together with further wavelet developments, was instrumental to the invention of image-compression algorithms, like the JPEG2000, that pervade the digital age. ""Mathematical caricature"" is how Daubechies sometimes describes the way digital images strive to capture our reality with exaggerated simplifications, reducing what we see in the world to its essential features through pixel proxies and other mathematical manipulations. Wavelets can enable computers to provide greater resolution - functioning, in a sense, as human eyes naturally do, seeing more detail at the focal point and leaving the rest of the view comparatively blurry. (Daubechies, it might be worth noting, has a lazy right eye, and her left eye isn't great, either.)
Calderbank's amused indifference to the grassy pixelations nicely illustrates the power of wavelets: They find the action in an image, the important content. Little is lost if the grass is blurry. But when a goal is called back because of a questionable offsides decision, viewers and officials want to see fine-grained close-ups of the contentious moment.
Daubechies is most famous as a pioneer of wavelets, but more broadly, her scientific contributions over the last three decades have rippled out in all directions from the field of ""signal processing."" In mathematical terms, as in common parlance, a signal is something that conveys information. Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who first met Daubechies in 1998 when they were colleagues at Princeton, points out that signal processing ""makes up a huge proportion of applied math now, since so much of applied math is about the geometry of information as opposed to the geometry of motion and force"" - that is, it's more about the warp and weft of information than physical problems in, say, fluid dynamics or celestial mechanics.
Daubechies has sought out all sorts of ways to engage in the digital transformation of society. She has done key research studying analog-to-digital conversion technology, and through a tapestry of collaborations, she has brought her mathematical insights to areas of study including internet traffic, evolutionary morphology (analyzing data collected from lemur teeth and bones, starting with that Madagascar trip) and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Daubechies' wide-ranging and collegial mind-set has amounted to something of a social movement, the Stanford statistician David Donoho says, with projects large and small that ""send a beacon out."" He cites one of her more recent ventures: fineart conservation involving the Ghent Altarpiece - ""The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,"" a 15th-century polyptych attributed to Hubert and Jan van Eyck, arguably among the most important paintings in history. Time after time, Donoho says, Daubechies sparks research groups that signal: ""This is a happening thing.""
Many accolades have followed, including Guggenheim and MacArthur fellowships. In 2012, when she became a baroness (a title granted by Belgium's King Albert II), she composed a motto for her coat of arms evoking wavelets: ""Divide ut comprimas,"" or ""Divide so you can compress"" - borrowing from the Latin ""Divide ut regnes,"" or ""Divide so you can conquer."" In 2019, she received an honorary degree from Harvard, alongside the German chancellor Angela Merkel (who happens to have a doctorate in quantum chemistry).
And yet at times during her career, Daubechies worried about being a complete fake. And she still considers herself an oddball as a mathematician. ""I came out of left field,"" she says - she trained as a physicist before migrating into mathematics. ""And I think there are people who feel left field is where I belong."" She doesn't mind. She revels in finding meaningful and practical problems - and solutions - where other mathematicians assume there are none. Indeed, she puzzles over any problem she can find, and she is always game to take on the problems of others as well.
""I called her the deus ex machina adviser,"" says Cynthia Rudin, a Duke computer scientist who is one of her former Ph.D. students. ""When you're in the depths of despair, your project has crashed and burned and you have almost proven that what you're trying to do is impossible, Ingrid comes along and pulls you out of the pit of doom, and you can keep going.""
In the summer of 2018, when she turned 64, Daubechies threw herself a party in Brussels, about an hour away from her hometown in eastern Belgium. (Daubechies acquired American citizenship in 1996.) She chose to celebrate that birthday - rather than her 60th or 65th - because 64 is a more compelling number. It is a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on), and powers of two hold special sway in science, especially in digital signal processing, in which binary patterns of zeros and ones encode information. In binary notation, the powers of two are particularly pleasing, because they all begin with a one followed by increasing quantities of zeros: 2 = 10, 4 = 100, 8 = 1000, 16 = 10000, 32 = 100000. Daubechies, in the summer of 2018, was turning 1000000.
Daubechies booked a venue, a caterer, a troupe of majorette dancers known for farce - and then at the party made a surprise appearance in the baton-twirling cancan line, disguised in makeup and a tutu. Afterward, she did what a mathematician more typically does to commemorate a special birthday: She attended a conference in her honor. Three days of talks among students and collaborators past and present offered delicacies to tickle her eclectic fancy: exploring how high-dimensional geometry is revolutionizing the M.R.I. industry; ""going off the deep end with deep learning,"" a type of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks; and investigating dark matter and dark energy and gravitational waves. A common denominator was wavelets, which facilitate the expansion or compression of information (often by powers of two).
In her recent fine-arts research, Daubechies has used wavelets as an intermediate tool, extracting and simplifying an image's essential features in preparation for more in-depth analysis. A week before her birthday conference, she attended the sixth international workshop on image processing for art investigation at the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, which featured the continuing restoration on the famed altarpiece. Her work in this area began at the first ""IP4AI"" workshop, in Amsterdam in 2007, with a computational analysis of Vincent van Gogh's brushstrokes to characterize the ""core"" of the artist's style and help identify forgeries.
The Ghent Altarpiece's 12 panels - together standing about 12 feet wide by 17 feet tall - have presented several problems for conservators that Daubechies and her fellow mathematicians are helping to solve. One investigation involves a pair of double-sided panels depicting large portraits of Adam and Eve on one side, with smaller scenes painted on the other. When using X-rayed images to assess damage, conservators have difficulty ""reading"" the intermingled images. After processing the visual information using wavelets, Daubechies and her team deployed a deep neural network algorithm - typically used for facial recognition - to separate the content of the X-rays. Another investigation explored whether a book depicted in a central panel is merely symbolic, with deliberately illegible squiggles for letters, or a reproduction of an actual text obscured by the craquelure, the web of cracks in the paint. ""I come up with a problem, she comes up with a solution,"" Maximiliaan Martens, an art historian at Ghent University, said at the workshop. ""Usually, I get lost in the mathematics.""
The talks quickly became technical - one mentioned ""disrobing Adam and Eve with the linear-osmosis model"" - and there was heated debate about the advisability of using artificial intelligence to conserve iconic artworks. On the last day, Daubechies visited the altarpiece at St. Bavo's Cathedral. ""Whenever I come to Ghent, I always try to see it,"" Daubechies told me. She was baptized Catholic, and while she's not religious, she embraces what she calls a ""feeling of spirituality."" But she can't reason that out - ""and I don't need to,"" she said. Peering up at the masterpiece through the hushed darkness, she commented that whereas beautiful art gives an emotional delight and resonates spiritually, beautiful mathematics gives ""a logical shortcut, an intellectual delight.""
Wavelets offer delight, for instance, because they allow ""sparsity"" - they succinctly capture and represent fine-grained detail only when it's relevant or desired. ""This feature is enormously helpful in a variety of A.I. and data-science settings,"" says Rebecca Willett, a professor of computer science and statistics at the University of Chicago. ""By leveraging a sparse representation of a signal or image, computers can 'learn' from fewer examples, and data can be stored with fewer bits. Ingrid's work is enormously significant on its own, and it also inspired a generation of researchers to explore new ways beyond wavelets to represent signals and images and develop new theory and tools that can better exploit sparse representations.""
'When you're in the depths of despair, your project has crashed and burned and you have almost proven that what you're trying to do is impossible, Ingrid comes along and pulls you out of the pit of doom, and you can keep going.'
Daubechies closed out the summer of her 64th birthday at the Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. During a midnight lecture she explained how, as a mathematician working with an algorithm, she filled in the altarpiece's craquelure. ""You do it mathematically the same way as an art conservator would do it visually,"" she said. After one algorithm identifies voids left by cracks, another algorithm guesses, based on the adjacent areas, what is likely to have been there. Through this process (and with expert interpretation by paleographers), the book came into focus: a work by the Italian theologian Thomas Aquinas. Daubechies concluded her talk with another motto she oft repeats: ""Math can help! As always!""
At a deeper level, however, it is not known what's going on inside machine learning's black box. Systems that humans can understand and query would make the technology more transparent, reliable and trustworthy. And to this end too, Daubechies thinks mathematics can help. Machine learning's success - demonstrated perhaps most strikingly with GPT-3, the language-prediction model that can write essays, answer trivia questions and compose computer code, among other text-oriented tasks; and AlphaFold, an artificial-intelligence technology that, in its ability to predict protein structures, solved a 50-year-old ""grand challenge"" in biology - is something that Daubechies believes mathematicians and mathematically inclined scientists should attend to more. ""Machine learning works very well, and we don't know why it works so well,"" she says. ""I consider that a challenge for mathematicians, to understand it better. If we do, it will go much further than if we don't."" Usually, the argument is that beautiful, pure mathematics eventually - in a year, in a century - produces compelling applications. Daubechies believes that the cycle also turns in the opposite direction, that successful applications can lead to beautiful, pure mathematics. Machine learning is a promising example. ""You can't argue with success,"" she says. ""I believe if something works, there is a reason. We have to find the reason.""
Coming of age in the 1970s, during feminism's second wave, Daubechies went off to the Free University in Brussels expecting to be the best. Since childhood, she had been intrigued by mathematical truths - when she couldn't fall asleep, she computed the powers of two in her head. Despite her interest in math, she planned to study engineering; her father was a civil engineer. She loved making things, including patterns for her dolls' clothing, transforming flat material into three-dimensional creations. And she was interested in how machinery worked. But during a class visit to a civil-engineering department, the concrete constructions undergoing durability testing seemed like ""glorified Ikea."" She switched to physics. Her mother - who, Daubechies recalls, was bored out of her mind as a homemaker and so went back to college, studied criminology and found work as a youth-protection counselor - was aghast: ""Physics! Engineering is a profession. Physics is like being an artist.""
Physics meant a lot of math classes. One classmate was Jean Bourgain (a winner in 1994 of the Fields Medal, the so-called Nobel Prize of mathematics, who died in 2018). Daubechies quickly figured out that Bourgain was at least her equal at math. When she realized he was superior, she promptly developed a crush: ""He was the first boy I met who was smarter than I was.""
Daubechies did her Ph.D. at the Free University, but given her interests, the French American physicist Alex Grossmann, based in Marseilles, became one of her advisers. Not long after, in the early 1980s, Grossmann and the French geophysicist Jean Morlet began using techniques from quantum mechanics to study seismic traces, the wavy curves plotted by a seismograph. They coined the term ""wavelet"" - in French, ""ondelette,"" meaning ""small wave."" Daubechies became swept up in her adviser's enthusiasm for tackling a new topic and forging a technique that led to the new paradigm: wavelet theory.
In mathematics, waves are fundamental and ubiquitous. The sine wave is a smooth, periodic undulation, a mathematical idealization of waves found in nature: energetic seismic waves produced by earthquakes; sonic booms propagating through air; tsunamis spreading across water. ""And even things that don't have this wavy effect, things that are much more complex, can be constructed as a conspiracy of different waves,"" Daubechies says. ""You can build almost anything by combining, in clever ways, waves of different wavelengths.""
This idea dates back two centuries: In 1822, the French physicist and mathematician Joseph Fourier published a paper outlining his analytical theory of heat. (Fourier is credited with discovering the greenhouse effect.) He proposed that all periodic functions - all periodic phenomena - could be understood as sums of sine and cosine waves. Throughout the 19th century, Fourier analysis evolved to include wider classes of phenomena, including waves that change their shape over time rather than repeating identically forever. Fourier analysis helped solve problems in physics and engineering. But this approach had its limitations: It couldn't efficiently handle signals with abrupt changes, like spoken language or pictures with sharp edges and sudden transitions in luminosity. In the 20th century, scientists in disparate fields overcame these difficulties by developing tools that coalesced into the mathematical theory of wavelets.
Wavelets, in essence, allow for bespoke representations of data, a versatile tailoring to the type of information within any given data set. They are more adaptable; they can efficiently and effectively capture those abrupt changes. Sometimes Daubechies gives a fancifully impractical musical metaphor to describe the difference. For Fourier analysis, she envisions a room full of thousands of idealized tuning forks, each sustaining a uniquely assigned note indefinitely. When the tuning forks are struck, at just the right time and intensity, and within short intervals of one another, the frequencies of their reverberations - ""woooOOOooo, woooOOOooo, woooOOOooo"" - combine and conspire to produce a rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
Wavelets, by contrast, are a more sophisticated symphony orchestra of tuning forks that each ring for a shorter time. They can, in a manner of speaking, read and convey all the information contained in the musical score: information about tempo and note duration, and about even more granular nuances of musicality, like variations in the same note on different instruments, or the same note on the same instrument by different musicians, or the attack at the start of a note, or the purity of tone held for bars at a time. ""With wavelets you can decompose all that in an efficient way,"" Daubechies says.
In 1984, still at the Free University, Daubechies became a tenured research professor in the department of theoretical physics. With Grossmann's encouragement, she had waded into wavelets the year before. She found that when asking ""why"" and ""how"" questions in signal analysis, the answers she came up with, as she recalled in her Guggenheim statement, ""were often not the same as the standard ones, and in some cases my answers were better. This was exciting, of course, and led to my first work on wavelets.""
In May of following year, she met Calderbank. He has worked in the realm of quantum computing since the beginning, in the 1990s (he is the ""C"" in CSS error correction); and he has made significant contributions to coding and information theory for wireless communications that support billions of cellphones. Then employed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., Calderbank was on a three-month exchange to the math division of the Brussels-based Philips Research. He and Daubechies were both extricating themselves from other relationships at the time, and by the end of the three months they decided to give a go of life together. She arranged a stint as a guest researcher at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, starting in the spring of 1986. During the next year, she made her big breakthrough, the Daubechies wavelet.
The puzzle that Daubechies solved was how to take a recent wavelet advance - a thing of beauty, by the French mathematicians Yves Meyer and Stéphane Mallat, but technically impractical - and make it amenable to application. To ""put it on its head,"" Daubechies would say, but without making it ugly. As she said in the Guggenheim statement: ""It is something that mathematicians often take for granted, that a mathematical framework can be really elegant and beautiful, but that in order to use it in a true application, you have to mutilate it: Well, they shrug, That's life - applied mathematics is always a bit dirty. I didn't agree with this point of view.""
By February 1987, she constructed the foundation for what grew into a ""family"" of Daubechies wavelets, each suited to a slightly different task. One key factor made her breakthrough possible: For the first time in her career, she had a computer terminal at her desk, so she could easily program her equations and graph the results. By that summer, Daubechies wrote up a paper and, sidestepping a hiring freeze, secured a job at AT&T Bell Labs. She started in July and moved into a house recently bought with Calderbank, whom she married after popping the question the previous fall. (Calderbank had made it known there was a standing offer, but he resisted proposing out of respect for Daubechies' declared opposition to the institution of marriage.)
The ceremony was in May in Brussels. Daubechies cooked the entire wedding dinner (with some help from her fiancé), a Belgian-British feast of chicken with endive and Lancashire hotpot stew, chocolate cake and trifle (among other offerings) for 90 guests. She had figured that 10 days of cooking and baking would be manageable, only later to realize that she had neither enough pots and pans for the preparation nor refrigerator space for storage, not to mention other logistical challenges. Her algorithmic solution went as follows: Have friends lend her the necessary vessels; fill said vessels and pass them back for safekeeping in their fridges and for transport to the wedding. She encouraged the more gourmand guests to bring hors d'oeuvres instead of presents. Her mother, putting her foot down, bought an army of salt-and-pepper shakers.
Daubechies continued her wavelets research at AT&T Bell Labs, pausing in 1988 to have a baby. It was an unsettling and disorienting period, because she lost her ability to do research-level mathematics for several months postpartum. ""Mathematical ideas wouldn't come,"" she says. That frightened her. She told no one, not even her husband, until gradually her creative motivation returned. On occasion, she has since warned younger female mathematicians about the baby-brain effect, and they have been grateful for the tip. ""I could not imagine that I would ever have trouble thinking,"" Lillian Pierce, a colleague at Duke, says. But when it happened, Pierce reminded herself: ""OK, this is what Ingrid was talking about. It will pass."" Daubechies' female students also mention their gratitude for her willingness to push for child care at conferences, and sometimes even to take on babysitting duties herself. ""My adviser volunteered to entertain my toddler while I gave a talk,"" a former Ph.D. student, the Yale mathematician Anna Gilbert, recalls. ""She seamlessly included all aspects of work and life.""
In 1993, Daubechies was appointed to the faculty at Princeton, the first woman to become full professor in the mathematics department. She was lured by the prospect of mingling with historians and sociologists and their ilk, not only electrical engineers and mathematicians. She designed a course called ""Math Alive"" aimed at nonmath and nonscience majors and gave talks for the general public on ""Surfing With Wavelets: A New Approach to Analyzing Sound and Images."" Wavelets were taking off in the real world, deployed by the F.B.I. in digitizing its fingerprint database. A wavelet-inspired algorithm was used in the animation of films like ""A Bug's Life.""
""The Daubechies wavelets are smooth, well balanced, not too spread out and easy to implement on a computer,"" Terence Tao, a mathematician at the University of California, Los Angeles, says. He was a Princeton grad student in the 1990s and took courses from Daubechies. (He won the Fields Medal in 2006.) Daubechies wavelets, he says, can be used ""out of the box"" for a wide variety of signal-processing problems. In the classroom, Tao recalls, Daubechies had a knack for viewing pure math (for curiosity's sake), applied math (for practical purpose) and physical experience as a unified whole. ""I remember, for instance, once when she described learning about how the inner ear worked and realizing that it was more or less the same thing as a wavelet transform, which I think led to her proposing the use of wavelets in speech recognition."" The Daubechies wavelet propelled the field into the digital age. In part, wavelets proved revolutionary because they are so mathematically deep. But mostly, as Calderbank notes, it was because Daubechies, a tireless community-builder, made it her mission to construct a network of bridges to other fields.
In due course, the awards began piling up: The MacArthur in 1992 was followed by the American Mathematical Society Steele Prize for Exposition in 1994 for her book ""Ten Lectures on Wavelets."" In 2000 Daubechies became the first woman to receive the National Academy of Sciences award in mathematics. By then she was mothering two young children. (Her daughter, Carolyn, 30, is a data scientist; her son, Michael, 33, is a high school math teacher on Chicago's South Side.) And by all appearances she was handily juggling it all.
But despite her many successes, she was incapacitated by insecurities - sometimes she could barely get out of bed. At 40, after a difficult period, she found help and was finally diagnosed with chronic depression, having suffered dark episodes since puberty. Through therapy and medication, she found a manageable equilibrium. ""When I'm busy and happy, I feel I don't need the medication,"" she told me at Burning Man, where the profusion of radical creativity caused her to nearly forget her pills more than once.
During the pandemic, one particularly mood-elevating project has been ""Mathemalchemy,"" a collaborative math-art installation that opens in January at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. As Daubechies' husband told her, ""You found a way to do Burning Man at home"" - albeit via an estimated 334 hours of virtual meetings and 7,582 emails among a team of 24.
""But it's always a bad idea to skip,"" Daubechies says of her medication, because within a day, she starts sliding. She doesn't mind talking about depression, in part because she believes it's good for people to know that success doesn't inoculate against mental-health vulnerabilities and that it's a chronic problem requiring chronic solving. ""It's never really solved,"" she says. ""That is the case with many, many things. There is no static equilibrium."" She likens it to bicycling: ""You have to compensate, all the time.""
In 2010, Daubechies and Calderbank moved to Duke University, where he is now a professor and the director of the school's Information Initiative. The same year, she was elected president of the International Mathematical Union - another female first - and on her watch, in 2014, the I.M.U. awarded the Fields Medal to Maryam Mirzakhani, its first female recipient, following more than 50 male winners (Daubechies served as chairwoman of the medal committee). In 2014, the University of Cambridge tried to hire both Daubechies and Calderbank. Daubechies was offered the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics, held previously by, among others, Stephen Hawking and Isaac Newton - but never by a woman. Duke successfully counteroffered: The provost guaranteed funding to recruit and hire female mathematicians until they made up 30 percent of the faculty. This is a data-driven target: Surveys by the American Mathematical Society indicate that at universities with R1 status, the highest research classification, women constitute about 30 percent of math Ph.D. students, but only about 17 percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty.
One mathematician refers to the protean talents of her former adviser by describing Daubechies as 'the Meryl Streep of mathematics.'
Daubechies, for her part, has been unaware of biases affecting the trajectory of her career (though she admits to being oblivious to the subtleties of social signals). But from a societal perspective, the gender gap in math (and science) is a mere sampling of the fact that, according to a United Nations report that arrived in her inbox in March last year, 90 percent of the world's population has a ""deeply ingrained bias against women."" For 2020, Duke's hiring committee made offers to five women - ""the Fab Five,"" Daubechies calls them. Only two accepted; the scarcity of female candidates makes for fierce competition. One of them, Jessica Fintzen, first met Daubechies at Duke, though she knew her work. ""She's a role model as a very successful female mathematician,"" Fintzen says. ""You need to have a certain character to ignore the biases and survive.""
Countering underrepresentation is difficult and fraught, but there is also the inextricable challenge of facing down explicit sexism. For decades, the standard test image in the signal processing community was a picture, cropped to a headshot, of Lena Forsen, a Playboy centerfold model in 1972. Wearing a feathered hat and looking over a bare shoulder, Forsen made repeat appearances on conference screens and in papers. Even Daubechies used the photo for a time, unaware of its origins. But around the turn of the century, in solidarity with growing opposition to the picture, she swapped in another image that she still uses today: When she gives a talk explaining the essence of wavelets, her slides show four increasingly blurry copies of a sailboat photo (the message being that even at the coarsest scale, the image still contains useful information). The infamous ""Lena"" picture was still the go-to test image in the late 2000s, when the applied mathematician Rachel Ward, now a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, did her Ph.D. with Daubechies. (Ward refers to the protean talents of her former adviser by describing her as ""the Meryl Streep of mathematics."") In 2013, Ward and a co-author published a paper that instead used a headshot of Fabio Lanzoni, the Italian fashion model and actor. ""As young, untenured professors,"" Ward says, ""we felt the only way we could make a statement was through parody.""
Daubechies has also seen discrimination while serving on hiring and jury committees, and usually suggests that transgressors take an implicit bias test, as she has done herself more than once. Her tendency until recently was to let minor instances go with an eye-roll and perhaps a knowing glance to her colleague Lillian Pierce. But then she and Pierce had a conversation about these predicaments, and Daubechies concluded that passive exasperation was sending the wrong message. ""I realized that as a more senior woman, my responsibility was to stand up,"" she says. She took a course at Duke called ""Moving From Bystander to Upstander.""
Daubechies and Pierce first met at Princeton. An undergraduate at the time, Pierce was in the habit of typing up her research in a computer lab that was always empty. One day an office administrator told her that the lab was for grad students only and that she had to get out. ""I was petrified and horrified that I had done something wrong,"" Pierce says. ""Then I heard a voice behind me saying, 'Give her a key!' I don't think I had seen Ingrid in person before that moment. But it's classic Ingrid in that she believes in enfranchising people. And if people want to do math, they should be given the key.""
The advocacy sometimes generates pushback. A couple of years ago, serving on a national award committee, Daubechies backed the nomination of an excellent midcareer female mathematician instead of an older male who ended up the winner. The episode made Daubechies angry, and it brought on a period of discouragement and pessimism: ""Somehow, I just felt tired. Tired of the struggle to show that women can be great mathematicians, too, and are often undervalued."" Maybe, Daubechies thought, she had been living under a delusion, imagining that her efforts and those of others could have any real effect. ""It is a puzzle to myself as well, to feel this way - defeatism is not something I have a lot of experience with,"" she says. ""In fact, it was the major topic of my most recent therapy session!""
More characteristically, Daubechies redoubles her efforts - perhaps following some cathartic weeding in her garden - and perseveres. After all, she is the oddball mathematician who came out of left field and prevailed. At a big math conference not too long ago - the last she attended in person before the pandemic - Daubechies overheard a joke that she retold a few times on the way home. Somehow, it seems apropos: ""I don't get even,"" she said. ""I get odder.""

2512,2424601122.xml,"Domestic political pressures and longstanding cultural differences are putting a brake on Angela Merkel's push for swift agreement.BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders gathered on Friday to start hammering out a giant aid package to help their economies recover from the coronavirus calamity. But even before they began, the haggling had exposed fundamental differences between member states that must be finessed in coming days if they are to succeed in saving Europe's economy.The major sticking point is how much latitude to give those receiving the aid to spend it as they please. Since much of the money is  guaranteed by wealthier northern states, some of them are demanding that strings be attached to push economic, political, environmental and social reforms.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose nation recently took over the European Union's rotating presidency and who has led efforts to push ahead with the package, previously sounded optimistic. But she was cautious as she arrived about the prospects of reaching a deal.""It would be desirable but we must also face reality,"" she said. ""I expect very difficult negotiations,.""The  talks will continue at least into Saturday night, and no announcement is expected until then.It was the first time E.U. leaders held an in-person meeting since the outbreak of the pandemic that has upended so many of their plans, and officials hoped that being together would help them advance compromise faster.Video  showed them wearing masks and greeting each other with gentle bows and elbow-bumps. The leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- who have most challenged the bloc's liberal, democratic principles -- broke ranks and posed together maskless.The logistics around organizing the meeting in the time of Covid-19 were cumbersome. Special floor markings indicated distancing and the preferred flow of officials in the building.The leaders met in the biggest room in the new Europa building. It fits 300 people. Only the heads of 27 governments and the leaders of E.U. institutions were admitted. Earlier guidance had indicated that the leaders would be allowed on occasion to be visited by close advisers. But the usual dozen-plus entourage per leader is a thing of the past: they were limited to five advisers each.The show of bonhomie disguised political pressures and longstanding cultural differences that have slowed the quest for a swift agreement  spearheaded by Ms. Merkel along with France's president, Emmanuel Macron.Familiar trenches are being dug. Some northern European countries led by the Netherlands want sweeping liberalization of southern countries' economies and a reform of their public finances in exchange for stimulus.Most members from Europe's west want Hungary, Poland and other eastern members to adhere to environmental targets, to stop eroding the rule of law and to end attacks on immigrants and minority groups such as their Jewish and L.G.B.T. citizens if they are to tap E.U. funds.The leaders will try to agree on 1.8 trillion euros in funding -- about $2 trillion -- of which just over €1.1 trillion will be allocated to the bloc's budget for the next seven years, the normal way of setting out E.U. spending, and €750 billion will be separated out for a pandemic recovery fund.The recovery component under discussion includes a bold proposal that will enable the E.U. administrative branch, the European Commission, to borrow in the financial markets on a large scale and offer part of the funds it raises for free in the form of grants to needy members.In practice, that will mean more creditworthy E.U. nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face  onerous borrowing costs.In combination with a European Central Bank program to buy member states' debt at low interest rates to enable them to continue funding stimulus programs, the proposed €750 billion plan would be a major help to those most in need, especially in the European south where structurally weak economies were hammered by the coronavirus.Economists predict a recession unseen outside wartime in the region. Italy, Spain and France, the bloc's third, fourth and second-largest economies, will suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10 percent each this year.Greece and other smaller economies that were recovering from the bloc's last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren't sufficient to self-fund their recoveries, which leads them to turn to the European Union for help.Richer countries like Germany, which has played a catalytic role in forging compromise, stand to benefit from a fast and steady recovery in their weaker southern neighbors. They share a currency, the euro, and a common market for their goods and services.Germany's shifting role, from leader of the conservative rich north to champion of compromise, could be the deciding factor in this new battle for the European Union.""Germany has made a visible differentiation of its position,"" said Maria Demertzis, an economist and the deputy director of the Brussels-based research institute Bruegel. ""It hasn't forgotten issues of conditionality and reforms, but, for this moment, it's reordering its priorities.""This leaves the northern nations to be led by the Dutch, who are demanding a role in scrutinizing how the money is spent by their peers, which Italy and others view as unacceptable encroachment on their business.They instead propose that the European Commission act as a fair arbiter of whether countries' stimulus plans are wise and well designed.Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who faces a close election in less than a year, wants his Parliament to have a say in the disbursement of funding, a view that no other nation shares.""I estimate the chance of us reaching an agreement this weekend is less than 50 percent,"" Mr. Rutte said as he arrived at the meeting in Brussels on Friday morning, dimming hopes for a quick agreement.His insistence on strict conditions to the aid has irritated southern members, leading to tensions that are bound to play out in the negotiations.""To be fair, what the Dutch are saying isn't wrong, when they raise issues of big debts, or flag that countries need to reform,"" Ms. Demertzis said. ""But the question is timing: Is this the conversation you want to be having right now? The diplomacy is not right, the substance is.""It is far from certain that they'll reach an agreement. It is possible, rather, that they continue their talks on Sunday and even reconvene later this month, but there is consensus that they should have an agreement before an August summer break.tAnd while the proposed package includes mechanisms that would force countries to adhere to ambitious environmental goals and push them to improve the way they deal with their rule of law and minorities at home, certain eastern members object.""Linking those two areas, those two completely different legal areas, creates an enormous threat of legal certainty,"" said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland as he arrived at the meeting. ""We can't agree to that.""In the run-up to the meeting, his ally Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary prepared for a similar battle, getting his Parliament to vote on a resolution stating that E.U. procedures against Hungary for rule-of-law violations must be closed before the new budget is adopted, and that funding shouldn't be dependent on rule-of-law requirements.The aid package under discussion will allow the European Commission to develop new muscles that will make it resemble a federal government more than ever before. But many members view the institution with suspicion because it is a vast bureaucracy with little democratic accountability.The commission has in the past used the E.U. budget to issue bonds, but never at the scale proposed, and never to then distribute those loans for free. The proposals stress that this will be a  one-time exercise to combat a disastrous recession.The proposals will also allow the commission to find ways to raise its own funds, for example through a tax on carbon emissions, digital services and other cross-border activities. If it goes ahead, the commission will be managing both spending and revenue sides of the E.U.  balance sheet, and will be given the authority to levy taxes, a privilege usually reserved for elected governments.""We need to see what comes out of the meetings, but if this passes, it is in the direction of the countries backstopping a grant: This is an incredible step forward,"" said Ms. Demertzis. ""Everyone is talking about this being a one-off, but as we all know, there's nothing more permanent than temporary measures.""Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels and Ben Novak contributed from Budapest.At an E.U. meeting in Brussels this weekend, richer countries want to force other members to agree to economic, political and environmental reforms before they get pandemic assistance.

2279,1999049408.xml,"BERLIN -- After more than four months of tortuous negotiations, with her fate and Germany's hanging in the balance, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday announced a deal for a new government.But it was telling that Ms. Merkel, in power for 12 years, looked more weary than jubilant.
The new deal with the same old coalition partners -- her conservative alliance and the left-leaning Social Democrats -- is precisely the government that Germans had voted against in inconclusive elections last September. It leaves the far-right Alternative for Germany as the country's leading opposition party. And it comes at a high cost for Ms. Merkel, the incredible shrinking chancellor, who had to relinquish key ministries.
But what is troubling for many Germans is not necessarily bad news for Europe, which for years has depended on stability in Berlin and has been waiting in limbo as Ms. Merkel stumbled toward a deal.
The new arrangement must still be approved by the Social Democrats' rank and file. But if endorsed, the coalition may provide France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, with the partner he has been looking for to help buck up the European Union and move it away from the austerity policies that were identified with Ms. Merkel's old team and often blamed for stifling growth.
""Good news also for Europe!"" tweeted Pierre Moscovici, the French finance commissioner of the European Union.
In the new coalition, the powerful German Finance Ministry, once led by a hard-line Merkel ally, Wolfgang Schäuble, will be run by a Social Democrat. The party was critical of the government's tightfisted policies and may prove more flexible.
""A slightly weakened Germany could be one of the things that helps create a sense of a more balanced Europe,"" said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.
""Certainly, the fact that Wolfgang Schäuble is not finance minister will be greeted with enormous relief,"" he said, referring to anger in parts of Europe over painful austerity measures after the eurozone crisis.
It is hard to overstate the scope of German influence over European affairs during the Merkel era, especially in economic policy. Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Mr. Schäuble became the face of the German-led austerity policies imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece. Even as the Obama administration and an array of economists called for looser policies, the Germans held firm.
Beyond economics, Ms. Merkel has been the rock of European foreign policy, demanding a tough line on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia after the conflict in Ukraine while other European countries were far less enthusiastic.
And it has been Ms. Merkel who has pointedly stood up to President Trump, to the cheers of many Europeans and others who have embraced her as a defender of the liberal order.
But now the political landscape has shifted, not only in Germany, but also elsewhere in Europe.
The rise of Mr. Macron in France, if celebrated by those who support a stronger European Union, is also being interpreted as a rebalancing of power away from Berlin.
But France still needs Germany, not least to help bridge a growing rift between east and west on the Continent. Nationalist leaders in Central and Eastern Europe, led by Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, are challenging the liberal consensus at the heart of the European bloc.
The window to reshape Europe is short: Come fall, the last leg of the Brexit talks, a hard-fought election in the German state of Bavaria and the prospect of European elections will make it harder.
The answer of Ms. Merkel and the Social Democrats -- in no small part to persuade Germans that their ""grand coalition"" straddling left and right was still needed -- was to cast their lot fully with the mission to salvage the European project.
In what is otherwise a fairly unexciting governing pact, the Europe chapter -- short and vague, but prominently displayed on the first five pages of the 177-page document -- stands out.
""A New Departure for Europe!"" its ambitious headline reads, before listing proposals that include working toward greater powers for the European Parliament and creating a European Monetary Fund to help protect the eurozone against financial crises. Not all of Mr. Macron's most prominent proposals, like a European finance minister, are featured in the coalition document.
But Germany will increase its contribution to the European Union budget, the paper pledges. And it will cooperate with Europe on defense and migration.
""It's the first time that Europe is the first chapter in a German coalition treaty,"" said Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ""This is a clear signal that the government wants to work with President Macron on reforming and strengthening Europe.""
""On the open-to-closed spectrum, this was a signal for openness,"" he added.
But unlike in France, where Mr. Macron ran on a transparently pro-European platform, campaigning with a European flag and playing the European anthem on election night, Europe hardly featured on the German campaign trail.
""The challenge is that this was never tested in a real election,"" Mr. Leonard said.
Alternative for Germany immediately dismissed Wednesday's deal as proof that Europe's elites were ignoring the concerns of ordinary voters once again.
""One wonders, why Mr. Macron doesn't just move into the Chancellery,"" scoffed Alexander Gauland, a former member of Ms. Merkel's conservatives who became a lawmaker for Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. Ms. Merkel's conservatives, he said, had betrayed their values and become ""an empty shell.""
The fact that the Interior Ministry's portfolio was broadened to include a ""heimat"" -- homeland -- department to address issues of identity and integration did nothing to appease the AfD. Björn Höcke, a well-known far-right firebrand in the party, called the coalition deal ""un-German.""
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, a tired-looking Ms. Merkel praised the deal as the ""basis of a good and stable government, which our country needs, and which many around the world expect from us.""
For many, the coalition deal represented a bittersweet success, a sort of short-term fix with potentially steep political costs: a backlash in the making that could push ever more voters to the extremes.
In the two years since Ms. Merkel opened Germany's door to more than a million migrants, the country's political landscape has changed drastically, and much of the chancellor's ability to forge consensus has eroded.
All three parties now returning to government had their worst election results since the 1940s.
""The Merkel era is synonymous with a strong and stable Germany; that's what we had for the last decade,"" Mr. Enderlein said. ""That era is coming to an end. And we don't yet know what comes after.""
There is no guarantee that this coalition will last a full term, he said. There is not even a guarantee that it will happen: The unhappy grass roots of the Social Democratic Party still need to approve it by postal ballot and many balk at the thought.
Two stints as Ms. Merkel's junior partners saw the party's vote share slump from 34 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in September. Recent polls give it 17 percent support, just two percentage points more than the AfD. Some worry that another four years in a coalition could see the AfD overtake the Social Democrats.
But the alternative may be no better: If the coalition collapses and Germany is forced to call a snap election, the extremes will benefit -- both inside and outside the main parties, analysts predict.
""This is the worst possible outcome,"" said Mr. Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations, ""except for all the other ones.""

3958,1560659757.xml,"       NEWPORT, Wales --  NATO struggled to find responses to new challenges as it concluded its summit meeting here on Friday, announcing limited steps to deter Russia in Eastern Europe and starting to marshal broader international support to confront radical Islamists in the Middle East. The alliance said it would establish a rapid-reaction force with an essentially permanent presence in Eastern Europe and would enhance military cooperation with Ukraine. But the limits of the alliance were visible, too. The United States and Britain used the meeting to try to advance their own emerging policies, especially toward the spread of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, while most members shied away from specific commitments to increase military spending. The combination of crises -- one on NATO's borders with a resurgent Russia and the other involving a possible new terrorism threat from radical Islam -- represents the first major challenge to NATO in a quarter of a century. Though many words were said about the need to ""reinvigorate and refocus"" the alliance, as the host, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain put it, the summit meeting made only a small step toward doing so. President Obama, in a concluding news conference, said the message from the summit meeting to Russia was that ""actions have consequences"" and that a combination of NATO moves to enhance deterrence and coordinated sanctions on Russia from the United States and the European Union had helped pressure President Vladimir V. Putin to agree to a tentative cease-fire in Ukraine. There must be ""follow-through on the ground,"" Mr. Obama said. ""We are hopeful, but based on past experience also skeptical that, in fact, the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested."" It was clear from the start that NATO would neither deploy military force against Russia in Ukraine nor offer Ukraine any credible path toward membership in the alliance. Despite the harsh language about Russia's actions in Ukraine, accusations against Mr. Putin of duplicity and statements of support for Ukraine and its president, Petro O. Poroshenko, the real effort of NATO here was to reassure those of its own members geographically closest to Russia that the alliance would come to their defense, if necessary. Those Eastern European members said they came away from Wales reassured, but for Ukraine, a NATO partner but not a member, there was mostly moral support. No NATO country, let alone the alliance itself, is prepared to provide Ukraine with lethal military equipment to fight Russia and the rebels, and Mr. Poroshenko was being urged essentially to make the best deal he could with Russia's proxies while working for a more inclusive Ukrainian constitution and new parliamentary elections. There were pledges of about $20 million for trust funds to help Ukraine's military, and different countries were urged to help in various ways with nonlethal equipment and intelligence. And the United States and the European Union tried to put more pressure on Moscow by threatening to put new economic sanctions in place, probably early next week, a move that has nothing to do with NATO, which is a military organization. But sanctions have a longer-term effect while troops move quickly on the ground. And Mr. Poroshenko, with his forces at risk of losing a major port, Mariupol, in the end has endorsed a truce that seems to leave the status of eastern Ukraine uncertain and will probably be sharply criticized at home. NATO, rather than strongly bolstering Mr. Poroshenko's position, in some sense encouraged him to negotiate with the very rebels, ""the terrorists,"" as the Kiev government calls them, with whom he had said he would never negotiate. If Ukraine fell into a security no man's land, this NATO meeting more directly addressed important issues of deterrence and reassurance, making it clear to Moscow that any interference or ""hybrid"" attack on a NATO member, even one with a large Russian minority, would produce a strong collective military response. It was also because of NATO that France decided to suspend its delivery of Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia, a contract that had been signed years ago but became a large embarrassment for the current government because of Russian actions in Ukraine. As advertised, NATO on Friday approved plans for a 4,000-member rapid-reaction force, based in Eastern Europe and initially led by the British, to reassure existing members near Russia that the principle of collective defense remains sacrosanct. NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said the upgraded force, a spearhead for a larger reaction force, would send a clear message to potential aggressors, namely Russia, and represent ""a continuous presence."" ""Should you even think of attacking one ally, you will be facing the whole alliance,"" he declared as a two-day summit meeting in southern Wales drew to a close. Earlier Friday, the Obama administration said it had formed a coalition of countries to oppose Sunni militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, unveiling a military and political campaign that officials said could eventually be a model for fighting extremist groups around the world. But some diplomats said they were uncomfortable using a summit meeting of the 28-nation alliance as a backdrop for a smaller group with no NATO imprimatur and, except for Turkey, no named Muslim partners. Ukraine remained the prime issue for the alliance, with peace talks in Minsk, Belarus, where Ukraine, Russia and pro-Russian rebels produced what appeared to be an agreement for a cease-fire. Western leaders remain skeptical about whether the truce will last. They intend to go ahead with new sanctions on Russia, leaders at the meeting in Wales said. The European Union can suspend the new sanctions later, if Moscow withdraws its troops from Ukraine and observes the cease-fire, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. A cease-fire declaration is not enough, Ms. Merkel said. Verification is needed to determine whether the cease-fire is being carried out, whether Russian troops are being withdrawn and whether a buffer zone is established. ""Everything is in flux,"" she said. ""Therefore we should expect that these sanctions could indeed be put into force, but with the proviso that they can be suspended again if this process really takes place."" Britain's foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, told the BBC he favored immediately imposing the sanctions and then lifting them if the cease-fire held. NATO also grappled with the unwillingness of most of its members to meet their commitments to spend an amount equivalent to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, an issue on which the United States, which bears most of the alliance's costs, has become increasingly outspoken. The meeting yielded no new binding commitments for individual nations to move quickly to meet the defense spending target. But the alliance did agree to stop cutting defense spending, to spend more in real terms as their economies grew and to reach the 2 percent target within a decade. Members were also encouraged to spend at least 20 percent of their defense spending on equipment and research, not just on salaries and benefits. ""Russia's aggression against Ukraine is a wake-up call,"" Mr. Rasmussen said. The crisis had led the governments of NATO-allied nations ""to reconsider defense investment because it's now obvious that we cannot take our security for granted,"" he said. On Russia, the NATO communiqué condemned Moscow's annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine and continued the suspension of ""all practical civilian and military cooperation"" with Russia, although diplomatic conversations would continue. ""We continue to believe that a partnership between NATO and Russia based on respect for international law would be of strategic value. We continue to aspire to a cooperative, constructive relationship with Russia,"" the alliance said, but ""in a Europe where each country freely chooses its future."" Britain also said it would supply 1,000 personnel, including a brigade headquarters, for the new rapid-reaction force. In addition, 3,500 British troops will take part in NATO exercises in Eastern Europe through 2015, though there may be some overlap between the two commitments. NATO announced that its next summit meeting, in 2016, would be in Warsaw.

2056,433491807.xml,"      Edmund Stoiber, a leading conservative powerbroker and an ally and irritant to Chancellor Angela Merkel, said he would step down in September as Bavaria's prime minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, a sister party of Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats. Mr. Stoiber, the governor of Bavaria, Germany's largest state and its economic powerhouse, for almost 14 years, had been under attack from within his party as opinion polls showed his and the party's ratings sinking. Last month, he was forced to accept the resignation of his chief of staff after a party member critical of Mr. Stoiber accused the aide of snooping on her private life. The polls also shook Mrs. Merkel's party, which relies on the muscle of the Bavarian conservatives in federal elections.   JUDY DEMPSEY  ",2007-01-19
1108,1018597148.xml,"      ATHENS -- As European leaders grapple with how to preserve their monetary union, Greece is rapidly running out of money.   Government coffers could be empty as soon as July, shortly after this month's pivotal elections. In the worst case, Athens might have to temporarily stop paying for salaries and pensions, along with imports of fuel, food and pharmaceuticals.   Officials, scrambling for solutions, have considered dipping into funds that are supposed to be for Greece's troubled banks. Some are even suggesting doling out i.o.u.'s.   Greek leaders said that despite their latest bailout of 130 billion euros, or $161.7 billion, they face a shortfall of 1.7 billion euros because tax revenue and other sources of potential income are drying up. A wrenching recession and harsh budget cuts have left businesses and individuals with less and less to give for taxes -- and growing incentive to avoid paying what they owe.    The budget gap is widening as the so-called troika of lenders -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission -- withholds 1 billion euros in bailout money earmarked for government financing while it waits to see whether new leaders elected June 17 will honor Greece's commitments.   Even if the troika delivers that money, Greece will struggle to cover its obligations. It underscored a harsh reality that is playing out in other troubled euro zone economies. Prolonged austerity is making it harder, not easier, for governments like Greece to become self-reliant again.    A top Spanish official acknowledged on Tuesday that Spain could not readily return to the markets to raise money because investors are demanding such high rates, highlighting how the debt crisis is spreading to larger economies in Europe.    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said a day earlier that European leaders needed to find a way to create the political union that the world is looking for to complement their monetary union. European officials took a small step in that direction Tuesday by proposing a central authority for banking regulation, which would require countries to give up a bit of cherished sovereignty.    An essential element of Greece's recovery plan has been to collect more taxes from a population that has long engaged in tax avoidance. The government is owed 45 billion euros in back taxes, tax officials in Athens said, only a fraction of which will ever be recovered.   To understand the difficulty, just talk to Nikos Maitos, a longtime official in Greece's financial crimes investigation unit.    When he and a team of inspectors recently prowled the recession-hit island of Naxos for tax evaders, a local radio station broadcast his license plate number to warn residents.    ""One repercussion of the crisis is that people are harder to find,"" Mr. Maitos, an imposing, burly man, said last week in his sweltering office on the edge of Athens. ""And when you do find them, they don't have money.""   Even tax collectors, who have had to take large pay cuts, find that budget reductions make it hard to pay for the gasoline needed to reach their targets.   ""After two and a half years of austerity, it's really a difficult time to bring in revenue,"" said Harry Theoharis, a senior official in the Greek Finance Ministry who helps oversee the country's tax payment system. ""You can't keep flogging a dead horse.""   Salaries and pensions in the private and the public sectors have been cut by up to 50 percent, leaving Greece 495 million euros short of its revenue targets in the four months ended in April, according to the Greek Finance Ministry. With less cash, consumers have curbed spending, leading thousands of taxpaying businesses to fail.   Income expected from a higher, 23 percent value-added tax required by the bailout agreement has fallen short by around 800 million euros in the first four months of 2012. That is partly because cash-short businesses that were once law-abiding have started hiding money to stay afloat, tax officials said.   Greece's General Accounting Office said recently that the state collected 25 percent less revenue in May than it did a year earlier. And the state has had to slash its goal of raising 50 billion euros from privatizations to just 3 billion euros as foreign investors lose interest.   That has left a caretaker government scrambling for a Plan B. One thought is to take billions of euros reserved for recapitalizing Greek banks, which have suffered from a flight of deposits amid political uncertainty and fears that Greece may abandon the euro for its own currency. But using that money would require the troika's approval. Other notions, like i.o.u.'s and scrip, so far are only that -- ideas.   To some extent, government officials said the tax-avoiding mentality is starting to change amid an aggressive enforcement campaign aimed at 500 wealthy individuals and companies, including former ministers and heads of state agencies and enterprises. People took notice in April when a former defense minister was arrested on charges of corruption and making false declarations related to his income and taxes.   ""They are awed when they see inspectors now because of recent cases showing people will be prosecuted or made to pay,"" Mr. Maitos said.   Tax collectors got another potential lift recently when the government started enforcing a 1995 law that gives them access to bank accounts of suspected tax evaders.   But Nikos Lekkas, a top official at the financial crimes agency where Mr. Maitos works, said Greek banks had obstructed nearly 5,000 requests for account data since 2010.   ""The banks delay sending the information for 8 to 12 months,"" he said. ""And when they do, they send huge stacks of documents to make it confusing. By the time we can follow up, much of the money has already fled.""   In the past two years, the agency managed to assess back taxes worth 650 million euros on 210 of the cases, he said. But only 65 percent could be collected.   One challenge lies in what Mr. Lekkas calls the big fish -- 18,300 offshore businesses belonging to wealthy Greek individuals and companies. Authorities are trying to trace the owners through property records, and they recently seized several large properties linked to offshore companies whose owners owe tens of millions of euros to the state.   That leaves collectors having to go after mostly smaller tax evaders, often with mixed results.   During a surveillance trip on the resort island of Santorini, Mr. Maitos said he and two colleagues observed a gas station owner insisting on cash-only transactions to avoid declaring taxes. When confronted, the man lashed at them with a bullwhip while cursing the state for taking his money.   Officials said things might improve drastically once Greece's entire tax system is computerized, a move that is supposed to be completed by the end of this year.    Charalambos Nikolakopoulos, the head of the Greek tax collectors' union, said there was no need for outsiders to straighten things out.   ""Yes, we need change,"" Mr. Nikolakopoulos said. ""But things will only improve in Greece when we get a stable government that will impose its political will.""

2560,1686259776.xml,"       WASHINGTON --  One year after President Obama rallied core allies to join the United States in punishing Russia for its bellicose ways, he will use a gathering on Sunday of the world's largest industrialized democracies to urge them to stand strong, and together, in isolating the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. But this time, Mr. Obama faces an additional challenge: It is not entirely clear that their efforts are working. The tough economic sanctions that have been the linchpin of American and European efforts to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea last year and its continuing aggression in Ukraine have, along with the lower price of oil, exacted a toll on Russia. They may even have helped deter Mr. Putin from escalating his intervention. But they evidently have not forced him to give up his designs on Ukraine or to surrender Crimea, and many analysts believe he is playing a waiting game on the assumption that he can outlast Euro-American solidarity. A recent visit by Secretary of State John Kerry to the Black Sea resort city of Sochi for a meeting with Mr. Putin -- questioned even by some inside the White House -- sharpened debate over the Obama administration's stance, leaving the Russian president claiming a diplomatic triumph while American officials scrambled to explain that their policy had not changed. Mr. Obama arrives in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday to face those doubts during a two-day summit meeting of the Group of 7 world powers. His immediate task is to steel the resolve of European powers scheduled to meet at the end of the month to review their sanctions against Moscow. Mr. Obama wants them to keep those measures in place, and also to signal that they are willing to go even further should Russia escalate its aggression in Ukraine. ""Most urgently, the focus is on maintaining the unity around the sanctions effort that has had very significant consequences on the Russian economy,"" said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. ""We need to maintain the pressure, show that there cannot be cracks in the trans-Atlantic unity, and show that the costs are just going to continue to grow for Russia,"" he added. Mr. Obama began laying the groundwork on Friday in a phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, in which the White House said he had reaffirmed American support and spoken of his determination to ""maintain costs on Russia and the separatists"" in eastern Ukraine until they honor a cease-fire agreement that is threatening to collapse after renewed clashes last week.  The debate over how to address Moscow's aggression in Ukraine is likely to overshadow the meetings, to be held at a castlelike luxury hotel with sweeping alpine views. World leaders will also weigh their next moves in the increasingly grim fight against the Sunni militant group Islamic State, after a conference last week in Paris yielded no breakthroughs on how the United States-led international coalition could reverse the group's gains. Mr. Obama is scheduled on Monday to meet with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting. There, he is likely to hear pleas for more American help in fighting the Islamic State, whose recent gains in Iraq and Syria have left the president and coalition partners in search of a winning strategy. It was not supposed to be this way for Mr. Obama, who, in the seventh year of his presidency, would like to use the Group of 7 gathering to advance his legacy. The president is hoping to secure pledges from American allies that they will make binding commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions before a December climate change summit meeting in Paris, which he has made a top priority. Mr. Obama also wants a strong statement from the group in support of free trade, another priority that is increasingly generating opposition both in the United States and among allies. He will need to reassure allies that even in the face of those challenges, he will ultimately have enough votes in Congress to push through trade promotion authority legislation that would pave the way for completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive deal spanning the Pacific Rim. The Group of 7 countries are more focused on a trans-Atlantic agreement, also far from being finished. ""They'll want private assurances from the president that he's got the votes,"" said Patrick Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based research organization. But it is the crisis in Ukraine that will consume much of the energy at the gathering, the second since the seven world powers, at Mr. Obama's urging, booted Russia from their group last year. Top among Mr. Obama's tasks will be ""a little bit of mopping up"" from the meeting Mr. Kerry held with Mr. Putin, said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""It created this kind of cloud of controversy around what is the U.S. strategy, why did he go?"" Ms. Smith said, calling the visit ""counterproductive"" in some ways. Mr. Obama is now in the position of emphasizing to European leaders, particularly Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the summit meeting's host, that ""we're not trying to undercut your efforts -- this was meant to enhance those efforts. Ms. Smith added, ""And there was no side deal -- there was no, special, secret agreement that you don't know about."" Mr. Obama will do so starting Sunday morning, when he is scheduled to stroll in the tiny, picturesque town of Krun with Ms. Merkel, tasting local food and taking in some Bavarian culture before the two hold a formal private meeting. White House officials argue that Mr. Kerry's meeting with Mr. Putin was a chance for the United States to discuss other critical issues, especially those on which it has maintained cooperation with Russia, such as the pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran and ending the conflict in Syria. These administration officials insist there is no flagging of resolve or lack of clarity about Washington's approach on Ukraine. ""I don't see any change in policy on Ukraine, nor do I see Ukraine fatigue,"" said Charles Kupchan, the senior director for European Affairs at the National Security Council. Still, Mr. Obama will face calls for clarity from his European partners about a policy that has not yielded the hoped-for results. ""The policy was quite robust and rigorous in the first few months after the illegal annexation of Crimea, but it seems to be in a bit of a float,"" said Heather A. Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""All of the G-7 leaders are going to have a lot of questions for President Obama, focusing on what's next, what's the plan."" President Vladimir V.

1615,2182028666.xml,"MUNICH -- Vice President Mike Pence made his case for ""America First"" in the deeply hostile territory of an annual conference of America's closest European allies on Saturday. He was not deterred from repeating his demands that Europe withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, ban Chinese gear from global communications networks and accelerate its increases in contributions to NATO.Mr. Pence received a predictably tepid response, mainly from a crowd of visiting Americans. They included a number of Republican members of Congress who came here to Munich, along with the Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, at a fraught moment in the trans-Atlantic relationship.Hours later, Mr. Pence's predecessor, Joseph R. Biden, received a brief standing ovation after delivering an impassioned rebuttal to the Trump administration's treatment of allies, in what appeared to be the foreign policy plank of a campaign for president -- if he decides to run.""I promise you, I promise you,"" Mr. Biden said. ""This too shall pass. We will be back. We will be back."" He never defined ""we.""Taken together, the two men defined the dramatic change in American foreign policy that has left the traditional allies who gather at the Munich Security Conference in despair, and has led the Trump administration to embrace newer, far more authoritarian allies in Central Europe. Mr. Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spent the week visiting several of them, in a European tour that bore little resemblance to similar trips taken by administrations past.""The contrast is between a new foreign policy that focuses on America first and expects others to do as we say no matter what,"" said Ivo Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO and now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, ""and the old foreign policy of working together in pursuit of common values.""Mr. Pence did acknowledge significant progress in getting more NATO members to live up to their commitment to contribute 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense by 2024. Even the current secretary general of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg of Norway, said on Saturday that ""European allies are stepping up more for defense.""But Mr. Pence went further.He repeated a call that he made in Warsaw on Thursday, during an American-led conference of foreign ministers chiefly from Arab and European states, that Britain, France and Germany withdraw from the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.It was a demand they had no intention of complying with, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made clear in an impassioned defense of alliances and Europe's approach to Iran that preceded Mr. Pence's speech by only moments.Mr. Pence, fresh from a visit Friday to the Auschwitz concentration camp, accused Iran of seeking another Holocaust, citing speeches from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.He moved on to demands for other steps to wall off Europe from adversaries, insisting that the allies forgo any purchases of Russian arms, or the installation of advanced 5G communications networks made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant.""We cannot ensure the defense of the West,"" Mr. Pence said, ""if our allies grow dependent on the East.""The Munich conference has over the decades come to represent the alliance establishment; for years the American delegation was led by the late Senator John McCain of Arizona. (Mr. Pence spoke at a dinner in Mr. McCain's memory on Friday night.)Over the years, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, has come to argue with the allies, and Mr. Pence was followed by one of the most influential officials in the Chinese foreign policy hierarchy, Yang Jiechi. He spent some of his time talking about the United Nations and climate change, perhaps betting that Mr. Pence would mention neither. (He was right.)Mr. Yang pushed back against Mr. Pence, who had left the auditorium before the Communist Party leader spoke, declaring that ""China doesn't require companies to install a backdoor or to collect intelligence."" But he never addressed the new Chinese law that would require companies like Huawei to assist Chinese intelligence agencies in any investigations.Mr. Biden seemed to side with the organizers of the conference, who opened it with the release of a report titled, ""Who Will Pick Up The Pieces?"" It focused on a rapidly restructuring world order, and the anxiety among America's allies that the Trump administration's erratic leadership is a threat to their own security.Mr. Biden picked up on that theme but also tried to stake out a tougher line on Russia than the Trump administration has. He condemned Russia's interference in the 2016 election, a topic Mr. Pence did not address.""I'm not concerned about Russian influence in Europe alone,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I'm concerned about Russian influence in America.""He noted the Obama administration's sanctions against Russia at the end of its term, without mentioning the widespread sense among his former administration colleagues that, in retrospect, their actions were far too little and too late.But Mr. Biden also warned against nostalgia and laid out his own challenge for NATO -- that it must modernize to deal with new threats, starting with cyberattacks and information warfare. NATO is arguably a decade or more behind in the cyber arena. While it had a long-established playbook to deal with traditional armed invasions and even nuclear conflict, it only recently began discussing an offensive cyberstrategy.With steady message control, Mr. Pence used every stop on his European visit to reinforce the administration's message that Iran needed to be confronted and Western allies needed to get in line.Leaving Auschwitz on Friday, he told reporters aboard his plane to Munich that the trip to the concentration camp had only enforced his belief that the Trump administration should stay heavily aligned with Israel and to ""stand strong"" against Iran.""The lesson of the 20th century is that when authoritarian leaders breathe out anti-Semitic threats of violence against the Jewish people,"" Mr. Pence said, ""freedom-loving people should take them seriously and be prepared to confront them.""In Munich, he turned briefly to negotiations to resolve a damaging trade war with China, saying that a true solution was contingent on a host of related issues, including the theft of intellectual property and free navigation in the South China Sea.""President Trump has great respect for President Xi, and so do I,"" Mr. Pence said, but added, ""Beijing knows where we stand.""One curious result of the competing messages from Mr. Pence and Mr. Biden is that Ms. Merkel, in her last years in office, has emerged again as the biggest defender of the traditional order. She received a standing ovation when she was asked by the conference's organizers who would pick up the pieces.""Only all of us together,"" Ms. Merkel replied, to a round of applause.At the annual Munich Security Conference, Vice President Mike Pence had a list of demands based on American interests.

2528,2124664632.xml,"WASHINGTON -- When President Trump calls old friends on one of his iPhones to gossip, gripe or solicit their latest take on how he is doing, American intelligence reports indicate that Chinese spies are often listening -- and putting to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president and affect administration policy, current and former American officials said.Mr. Trump's aides have repeatedly warned him that his cellphone calls are not secure, and they have told him that Russian spies are routinely eavesdropping on the calls, as well. But aides say the voluble president, who has been pressured into using his secure White House landline more often these days, has still refused to give up his iPhones. White House officials say they can only hope he refrains from discussing classified information when he is on them.
Mr. Trump's use of his iPhones was detailed by several current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could discuss classified intelligence and sensitive security arrangements. The officials said they were doing so not to undermine Mr. Trump, but out of frustration with what they considered the president's casual approach to electronic security.
American spy agencies, the officials said, had learned that China and Russia were eavesdropping on the president's cellphone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepting communications between foreign officials.
The officials said they have also determined that China is seeking to use what it is learning from the calls -- how Mr. Trump thinks, what arguments tend to sway him and to whom he is inclined to listen -- to keep a trade war with the United States from escalating further. In what amounts to a marriage of lobbying and espionage, the Chinese have pieced together a list of the people with whom Mr. Trump regularly speaks in hopes of using them to influence the president, the officials said.
Among those on the list are Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Blackstone Group chief executive who has endowed a master's program at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and Steve Wynn, the former Las Vegas casino magnate who used to own a lucrative property in Macau.
The Chinese have identified friends of both men and others among the president's regulars, and are now relying on Chinese businessmen and others with ties to Beijing to feed arguments to the friends of the Trump friends. The strategy is that those people will pass on what they are hearing, and that Beijing's views will eventually be delivered to the president by trusted voices, the officials said. They added that the Trump friends were most likely unaware of any Chinese effort.
L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Mr. Wynn, said his client was retired and had no comment. A spokeswoman for Blackstone, Christine Anderson, declined to comment on Chinese efforts to influence Mr. Schwarzman, but said that he ""has been happy to serve as an intermediary on certain critical matters between the two countries at the request of both heads of state.""
Russia is not believed to be running as sophisticated an influence effort as China because of Mr. Trump's apparent affinity for President Vladimir V. Putin, a former official said.
China's effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump's calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.
The Chinese and the Russians ""would look for any little thing -- how easily was he talked out of something, what was the argument that was used,"" said John Sipher, a 28-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency who served in Moscow in the 1990s and later ran the agency's Russia program.
Trump friends like Mr. Schwarzman, who figured prominently in the first meeting between President Xi Jinping of China and Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president's Florida resort, already hold pro-China and pro-trade views, and thus are ideal targets in the eyes of the Chinese, the officials said. Targeting the friends of Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Wynn can reinforce the views of the two, the officials said. The friends are also most likely to be more accessible.
One official said the Chinese were pushing for the friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with Mr. Xi as often as possible. The Chinese, the official said, correctly perceive that Mr. Trump places tremendous value on personal relationships, and that one-on-one meetings yield breakthroughs far more often than regular contacts between Chinese and American officials.
Whether the friends can stop Mr. Trump from pursuing a trade war with China is another question.
Officials said the president has two official iPhones that have been altered by the National Security Agency to limit their abilities -- and vulnerabilities -- and a third personal phone that is no different from hundreds of millions of iPhones in use around the world. Mr. Trump keeps the personal phone, White House officials said, because unlike his other two phones, he can store his contacts in it.
Apple declined to comment on the president's iPhones. None of them are completely secure and are vulnerable to hackers who could remotely break into the phones themselves.
But the calls made from the phones are intercepted as they travel through the cell towers, cables and switches that make up national and international cellphone networks. Calls made from any cellphone -- iPhone, Android, an old-school Samsung flip phone -- are vulnerable.
The issue of secure communications is fraught for Mr. Trump. As a presidential candidate, he regularly attacked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 campaign for her use of an unsecured email server while she was secretary of state, and he basked in chants of ""lock her up"" at his rallies.
Intercepting calls is a relatively easy skill for governments. American intelligence agencies consider it an essential tool of spycraft, and they routinely try to tap the phones of important foreign leaders. In a diplomatic blowup during the Obama administration, documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, showed that the American government had tapped the phone of  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
Foreign governments are well aware of the risk, and so leaders like Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin avoid using cellphones when possible.
President Barack Obama was careful with cellphones, too. He used an iPhone in his second term, but it could not make calls and could receive email only from a special address that was given to a select group of staff members and intimates. It had no camera or microphone, and it could not be used to download apps at will. Texting was forbidden because there was no way to collect and store the messages, as required by the Presidential Records Act.
""It is a great phone, state of the art, but it doesn't take pictures, you can't text. The phone doesn't work, you know, you can't play your music on it,"" Mr. Obama said on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" in June 2016. ""So basically, it's like -- does your 3-year-old have one of those play phones?""
When Mr. Obama needed a cellphone, the officials said, he used one of those of his aides.
Mr. Trump has insisted on more capable devices. He did agree during the transition to give up his Android phone (the Google operating system is considered more vulnerable than Apple's). And since becoming president, Mr. Trump has agreed to a slightly cumbersome arrangement of having two official phones: one for Twitter and other apps, and one for calls.
Mr. Trump typically relies on his cellphones when he does not want a call going through the White House switchboard and logged for senior aides to see, his aides said. Many of those Mr. Trump speaks with most often on one of his cellphones, such as hosts at Fox News, share the president's political views, or simply enable his sense of grievance about any number of subjects.
Administration officials said Mr. Trump's longtime paranoia about surveillance -- well before coming to the White House he believed that his phone conversations were often being recorded -- gave them some comfort that he was not disclosing classified information on the calls. They said they had further confidence he was not spilling secrets because he rarely digs into the details of the intelligence he is shown and is not well versed in the operational specifics of military or covert activities.
In an interview this week with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump quipped about his phones being insecure. When asked what American officials in Turkey had learned about the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, he replied, ""I actually said don't give it to me on the phone. I don't want it on the phone. As good as these phones are supposed to be.""
But Mr. Trump is also famously indiscreet. In a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office with Russian officials, he shared highly sensitive intelligence passed to the United States by Israel. He also told the Russians that James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, was ""a real nut job"" and that firing him had relieved ""great pressure.""
Still, Mr. Trump's lack of tech savvy has alleviated some other security concerns. He does not use email, so the risk of a phishing attack like those used by Russian intelligence to gain access to Democratic Party emails is close to nil. The same goes for texts, which are disabled on his official phones.
His Twitter phone can connect to the internet only over a Wi-Fi connection, and he rarely, if ever, has access to unsecured wireless networks, officials said. But the security of the device ultimately depends on the user, and protecting the president's phones has sometimes proved difficult.
Last year, Mr. Trump's cellphone was left behind in a golf cart at his club in Bedminster, N.J., causing a scramble to locate it, according to two people familiar with what took place.
Mr. Trump is supposed to swap out his two official phones every 30 days for new ones but rarely does, bristling at the inconvenience. White House staff members are supposed to set up the new phones exactly like the old ones, but the new iPhones cannot be restored from backups of his old phones because doing so would transfer over any malware.
New phone or old, though, the Chinese and the Russians are listening, and learning.

1847,2014385348.xml,"ESSEN, Germany -- Jörg Sartor does not like to turn newcomers away from his food bank, especially single mothers like the young Syrian woman with her 5-year-old son who had waited outside since before dawn.But rules are rules. And for the moment, it is Germans only.""Come here,"" said Mr. Sartor, waving the boy over. Mr. Sartor disappeared into a storage room and re-emerged with a wooden toy. Then the boy and his mother were shown the door, which for the past two weeks has had five letters scrawled across the outside: ""Nazis.""The decision of one food bank in the western city of Essen to stop signing up more foreigners after migrants gradually became the majority of its users has prompted a storm of reaction in Essen, a former coal town in Germany's rust belt, and across the country. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in: ""You shouldn't categorize people like this.""But the controversy has highlighted an uncomfortable reality: Three years after Germany welcomed more than a million refugees, much of the burden of integrating the newcomers has fallen on the poorest, whose neighborhoods have changed and who have to compete for subsidized apartments, school places and, in the case of the food bank, a free meal.Ask any of the Germans lined up outside the former water tower that houses the food bank one recent morning and they will call Mr. Sartor a ""people's hero.""""He stands up for us,"" said Peggy Lohse, 36, a single mother of three.Until recently, groups of young migrant men had sometimes elbowed their way to the front of the line, Ms. Lohse recalled. She went home empty-handed more than once. Some older women were so intimidated that they stopped coming altogether, she said.""We have worked and paid taxes in this country; our parents built it up,"" said Marianne Rymann, 62, also in line. ""How can it be that we are turned away and those who just arrived get what they need?""When some 1.2 million migrants arrived in Germany in 2015 and early 2016, they were distributed across the country with the aim of sharing the cost and optimizing the chances of integration. But many later left their designated homes, gravitating to areas that already had a high concentration of migrants.Essen, a city of 600,000 people, has seen its Syrian community grow to nearly 11,000 from 1,300 in 2015, said Peter Renzel, who is in charge of social policy at City Hall. Most of them live in the working-class districts of the north.""It is a challenge,"" Mr. Renzel said. ""Some districts carry a disproportionate burden.""The image of a line in which some wait their turn and others unfairly push to the front is a familiar one for Karlheinz Endruschat, a local Social Democrat, who represents the northern district of Altenessen.Apartments have become scarcer. Schools report that nine out of 10 of their students are non-German. Some German residents feel alienated by the number of newcomers.""There are times when you walk down the street and you are in the minority,"" Mr. Endruschat said.Mr. Endruschat is no fan of Mr. Sartor's decision to discriminate by passport. But he is even more critical of those who point a finger from a position of privilege.""Those who shout the loudest are the farthest from the problem,"" Mr. Endruschat said.When Ms. Merkel opened the border, she famously said, ""We will manage."" Now, some towns are saying they cannot.Cottbus and Freiberg in the former East Germany, and Delmenhorst and Salzgitter in the former West, are among a number of cities that have taken steps to stop more refugees from settling there, saying they are at or beyond capacity.Several food banks have sought to limit tensions by segregating immigrants and Germans by time or day. Some have banned young men from signing up -- in theory not to target migrants, but in practice exactly that.Sitting in his crammed office in Essen one recent morning, arms defiantly crossed over his substantial belly, Mr. Sartor scoffed. ""They're doing what I'm doing,"" he said. ""They're just not saying it.""A former coal worker who retired early when his mine shut down, Mr. Sartor has run the food bank for 12 years as a volunteer.He has deliberately left the Nazi graffiti on the door and on the charity's seven delivery vans, which have also been defaced. ""It's absurd,"" he said.Until three years ago, roughly one in three food bank users were foreigners, he said. By last November, it was three in four.Food bank users normally sign up for a year's pass, after demonstrating proof of need. It was Mr. Sartor's idea to block any more non-Germans from signing up, at least temporarily. The food bank continues to serve those foreigners already on its lists.When a message about the new policy went up on the food bank's website on Dec. 8, no one complained. It was only when the local newspaper wrote about it last month that the decision suddenly exploded into the national news.Given the controversy, representatives from the food bank, the city and migrant groups met over the weekend and agreed that the ban would be lifted ""as soon as possible"" -- but only after the numbers of migrants and native Germans evened out.For now, the share of foreigners among food bank users is still 60 percent, Mr. Sartor said.One of his 120 fellow volunteers resigned in protest over the decision. But those handing out bread, fish, vegetables and fruit on a recent afternoon said that something had to be done.One of them, Steffi Tamm, had just gotten off the phone with an older woman who was inquiring whether it was ""safe"" to come back to the food bank. ""Have those young men gone?"" she asked.Some of the threat, said Ms. Tamm, is more perceived than real. But she recalled how last year, whenever she opened the door on distribution day, it was like being caught in a scrum.""They came from both sides,"" she said, pointing at the door. ""I was practically overrun.""A single mother, Ms. Tamm, now 39, first came to the food bank as a user herself. That was 10 years ago. She remembers lining up outside, on a busy street a stone's throw from the main station, in plain sight of everyone.""There is already an element of shame in standing out there,"" she said. ""The last thing you need is having to fight for your place.""It is a question of ""dignity,"" she said.It is for others, too. The Syrian mother who was sent away one recent morning, Habib Banavsch, said she hated having to line up for charity. ""I would much rather be home in my country,"" she said quietly.But war is still raging in her city of Afrin, and she is alone looking after her son Yusef after his father left.""We need help,"" she said.In addition to language and cultural barriers, some here spoke of an attitude barrier between vulnerable and often older Germans in need and young, often male, migrants who had been through a lot. The migrants had made it this far not by following rules but by rebelling against them.""The willingness and ability of these young refugees to take their own fate into their hands feels threatening to people who have long given up on theirs,"" said Britta Altenkamp, a local member of the state Parliament. ""And now we are expecting these people to be the face of a tolerant and welcoming Germany.""The controversy has split the network of more than 930 food banks across the country that, like the one in Essen, belong to a charity called the Tafel. The charity has grown to 60,000 volunteers and serves 1.5 million people across Germany. Many of them have experienced similar tensions.Sabine Werth, who now runs the Berlin subsidiary, founded the network in 1993, when a wave of homelessness swept across her city. ""One of our founding principles is that we serve according to need, not origin,"" said Ms. Werth, 61.What Mr. Sartor has done, she said, amounts to ""Germany First.""But Germany First is popular with many, as Ms. Werth has learned the hard way in recent days. ""Cockroach,"" ""piece of dirt"" and ""foreigner's slut"" are some of the insults that have landed in her inbox. One longtime donor diverted his donation from Berlin to Essen, she said.He is not the only one. Mr. Sartor proudly showed off his donation account: Over the past two weeks the food bank has received as much as it would normally raise in six months. Some try to earmark their donation to Germans only, but Mr. Sartor does not accept those.His inbox is mostly full of praise: ""Keep going"" one message read. ""God bless you,"" said another. He has 2,340 unread emails.The nationwide head of the charity, Jochen Brühl, said the debate currently animating the country was largely missing the point. Germany is Europe's richest country and has a budget surplus of more than 40 billion euros ($55 billion), he pointed out.""The whole country is up in arms about this one little food bank in Essen,"" he said, ""when the real scandal is that in this rich country we have this kind of poverty.""Credit: KATRIN BENNHOLD; Christopher F.

572,2013705949.xml,"The German economy could hardly be in better shape as Angela Merkel formally began her fourth term as chancellor Wednesday. Unemployment is almost nonexistent, stock prices are at record highs, and there is almost no inflation.But the political compromise that allowed Ms. Merkel to remain in power could bring that boom to an end. She had to bend to demands from her party's junior coalition partner, and agree to roll back deregulation that, since 2005, has unleashed the country's economy.Now, with Europe's economy gaining momentum after a prolonged slump, Germany -- the Continent's economic powerhouse and de facto leader -- risks heading in the opposite direction.Ms. Merkel, who finally took the oath of office Wednesday along with her cabinet, faces the same political quandary afflicting many industrialized nations, including the United States. Life should feel great, but to many people, it doesn't. Their wages haven't budged, their jobs seem less secure, and they believe the good times have passed them by.In Germany, where unemployment is only 3.6 percent, many angry voters in last year's election deserted the two centrist parties, Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and the left-leaning Social Democrats, in favor of minority parties, especially the far-right Alternative for Germany.""People are less confident,"" said Stefan Sachs, a leader of a local chapter of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse. ""From one day to the next, you can be fired.""To get reluctant Social Democrats to eventually sign up for a coalition government after several months of coalition negotiations, Ms. Merkel made concessions that critics say would take Germany back to a time when the country looked more like France, with rules that protected workers from dismissal, provided a broad safety net -- and squashed entrepreneurship and growth.The power-sharing agreement gives the Social Democrats more influence over policy than in their previous coalition, which ruled until elections last year.In particular, Ms. Merkel ceded the Finance Ministry and control of the purse strings to the left-of-center party, which is likely to relax the strict fiscal discipline that prevailed under Wolfgang Schäuble. Mr. Schäuble, the finance minister from 2009 until he resigned last year, was a dominant figure not only in Germany but throughout Europe, where he enforced the austerity imposed on crisis countries like Greece and Portugal in return for eurozone aid. Austerity measures in the wake of the financial crisis largely involved shrinking government spending, by trimming pensions and cutting social programs, as a way to rein in budget deficits.He also pushed those countries to emulate Germany's reforms, in particular relaxing restrictions on hiring and firing. Many countries complied, at least to a degree, helping joblessness in the eurozone fall to 8.6 percent in February, down from more than 12 percent in 2013.Yet now, some critics believe Berlin is on the verge of refusing its own medicine. Without Germany serving as an example, leaders in other eurozone countries would have even more trouble negotiating the politically hazardous terrain of reform.""The coalition is undoing all the reforms that turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the locomotive,"" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, a German bank.Mr. Schmieding predicted that Germany's relative decline would pave the way for France to take over as the eurozone's driving force.France is roughly where Germany was at the beginning of the 2000s, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has begun his own, albeit fitful, reform drive.Although the two countries appear to have divergent narratives, Germany remains by far the eurozone's biggest economy, and Mr. Macron will need Ms. Merkel to fulfill his regional priorities, like overhauling the European Union's creaky machinery.Indeed, the increased power of the Social Democrats -- who have advocated greater investment spending and are resolutely pro-European -- could serve to support Mr. Macron, even if Germany backtracks on economic reforms, according to Hans Stark, a professor at the Sorbonne University who studies Franco-German relations.""It is in Germany's interest for Mr. Macron to succeed with his reform plans,"" Mr. Stark said.Domestically, the promises exacted by the Social Democrats during difficult negotiations with Ms. Merkel would make it easier for workers at small firms to organize, allow greater increases in pensions and put limits on companies' use of temporary workers.That last provision is of particular concern to automakers and companies that have relied on workers with short-term contracts to deal with fluctuations in demand. Unlike permanent employees, temporary workers can be laid off without big severance payments and lengthy negotiations with labor representatives.BMW, for example, was able to quickly react to a slump in car sales in 2008 and 2009 by cutting temporary workers. More recently, the automaker has hired workers on short-term contracts to meet a jump in orders for an S.U.V. model produced at a factory in Regensburg, Germany.It is a tool that companies here have used liberally -- temporary workers account for 9 percent of the German work force and 19 percent of workers 35 or younger.Proponents say the system helps younger or less-qualified workers get a footing in the job market, helping them get hired full time.But labor representatives accuse employers of abusing the system, creating a cohort of second-class workers living from one six-month contract to the next. Temporary workers are more at risk of slipping into poverty and are less likely to be married or have children, according to a study by the Hans Böckler Foundation, which is financed by German labor unions.Ogur Özalp, a 32-year-old from the town of Schwalmstadt, about 70 miles north of Frankfurt, worked on temporary contracts for six years at an auto industry supplier, where he inspected brake parts. But, according to the IG Metall union, Mr. Özalp was fired on a pretense just before the company would have been required to hire him full time.Under the coalition program, workers like Mr. Özalp could not make up more than 2.5 percent of a company's work force, with some exceptions. Businesses would have to offer permanent jobs to workers on short-term contracts after 18 months, instead of 24 months under current rules. Contracts could be renewed only once rather than three times.It remains to be seen how much of the coalition pact becomes law, and the economic effects may be milder than economists predict. Many experts warned that the government would kill job creation when it introduced a minimum wage in 2015. Unemployment continued to fall.But there are already signs that business leaders are worried about what they see as a drift toward the sclerotic Germany of old, led by an unpopular government bereft of new ideas.Surveys of business optimism have slipped in recent months after four years of nearly uninterrupted gains. Such pessimism can become self-fulfilling, discouraging businesses from expanding and hiring.For the moment, Germany's economy is so strong that few people remain unemployed for long. Still, people like Mr. Özalp often feel stuck in an endless series of insecure jobs.He quickly found a position at another parts maker -- unemployment in the region where he lives is only 4 percent. But the new job pays less, and he has a contract for only six months, he said, which may or may not be renewed.It has all had a profound impact on his personal life. ""We wanted to get married, buy a house and build a future,"" said Mr. Özalp, who lives with his fiancée. ""Now that's all up in the air.""Credit: JACK EWING; Aurelien Breeden and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Follow Jack Ewing on Twitter: @JackEwingNYT.Members of Germany's Social Democrats at the party's headquarters in Berlin.

2110,2438359139.xml,"Thousands had gathered in the German capital. But the march was shut down after an hour for failing to obey social distancing rules.BERLIN -- Thousands of Germans angered over restrictions intended to control the coronavirus marched in Berlin on Saturday, but the police dispersed them after an hour because many were violating the very social-distancing rules championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel that they say threaten their rights and livelihoods.Many of the marchers were bunched together and maskless in Berlin's streets, with some shouting ""Merkel must go!"" and others carrying American flags and a photo of President Trump that read, ""Help.""The city's police chief, Barbara Slowik, had earlier warned that even though the march was allowed to proceed after a week of legal wrangling, ""we will not be able or willing to watch tens of thousands assemble and create infection risks.""Despite some threats of violence from far-right groups, most marchers dispersed peacefully as police bullhorns declared the march an impermissible risk, and they moved to a nearby park for a rally that the police did not stop. But the events laid bare a percolating resentment of Mrs. Merkel's handling of the coronavirus threat despite its success compared with the response in other developed countries, especially the United States.And it came as Mrs. Merkel warned that infections would likely rise as winter approaches, with more people confined indoors, which could mean a return to a more severe lockdown like the one this past spring, which is credited with helping limit the spread of the virus.""We must expect that some things will be even more difficult in the coming months,"" Mrs. Merkel said on Friday at her traditional summer news conference.Officials estimated that 18,000 people had turned out to march in Berlin, and the park rally was expected to draw at least that many. A large, mostly maskless crowd also gathered in London's Trafalgar Square on Saturday, calling for an end to virus lockdowns and other restrictions.Although Germany has been celebrated for its ability to manage the pandemic, with schools reopening and signs of an economic rebound, many Germans who have found themselves out of work or furloughed are angry and afraid they could not withstand a second lockdown.""This is the second demonstration I've taken part in my lifetime,"" said Thomas Dausend, 64, from southwestern Germany. ""I'm here for my children and my grandchildren.""Pastor Dietmar Schwesig, who came from Bad Salzungen for the protest, said he had initially stood behind the governmental guidelines. But when Easter services in his church had to be canceled, he had what he called a change in perspective.""It's probably the first time in 2,000 years that Easter church services had to be canceled because of an infectious disease,"" he said, holding a bible and wearing his collar.The protest scene at the park, the Tiergarten near Berlin's famed Brandenburg Gate, was peaceful and almost picnic-like in some places. The protesters were not wearing masks but were mostly spread out, with some holding signs such as ""The Truth Will Come to Light.""On Friday, the German health authorities registered 1,571 new infections over the previous 24 hours, a slight dip from a recent high point a week earlier, when more than 2,000 new cases were registered in a single day, according to a New York Times database.The group that organized the march, based in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, is angry over the economic damage caused by the monthslong lockdown in the spring and restrictions imposed on public life that have led the German economy to shrink by 9.7 percent and caused millions to lose their jobs or be furloughed.But it quickly attracted support from vaccination skeptics, anticapitalists and members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, a party best known for its noisy nationalism and anti-immigrant views. It also is the largest opposition party in Parliament.For the AfD, the demonstration provided a chance to highlight criticism of Ms. Merkel's government, which has enjoyed widespread success and made Germany the envy of many countries for its handling of the virus.Berlin security authorities sought to ban the march over fears that participants would violate rules intended to prevent the spread of the virus. But supporters of the march assailed the ban as an attempt to stifle citizens' freedom and a violation of their constitutional rights.""The decision is a victory for freedom over the established parties' antidemocratic, ideology-driven policy of prohibition and paternalism,"" said Tino Chrupalla, a spokesman for the AfD.Earlier this month, the police broke up a similar protest after an estimated 20,000 demonstrators, defying orders that they wear masks and keep a distance of at least five feet from one another, marched along the same route demanding an end to the restrictions.Berlin's top security official, Andreas Geisel, cited behavior during the Aug. 1 demonstration in welcoming the initial decision to ban Saturday's protest, a decision that was later overturned. Nevertheless, Mr. Geisel said he was ""not prepared to accept that Berlin is abused a second time as a stage for corona deniers"" and ""right-wing extremists.""About 18,000 protesters gathered in Berlin on Saturday before the police shut down the march.

576,1013896480.xml,"      BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said Wednesday that she was ready to discuss stimulus programs to get the Greek economy growing again and that she was committed to keeping Greece in the euro zone, signaling a softer approach toward the struggling country.   The fierce rhetorical salvos out of Germany in the past week gave way to conciliatory gestures by Ms. Merkel, who throughout the crisis has shown a propensity for managing through brinkmanship. ""I have the will, the determination to keep Greece in the euro zone,"" she said in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday, in what appeared to be an attempt to relax an increasingly tense situation.    If Greek officials are looking for ""stimulus to be pursued for growth in the euro zone, which we could pursue in the interest of Greece, we're open for this,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""Germany is open for this.""   Europe was shaken anew this week by the chaos in Greece, where a bank run threatened to hasten the country's exit from the euro and jeopardize the Continent's financial stability. While the impact of a country's leaving the euro is hard to predict, economists fear the crisis could spread to much larger countries like Spain and Italy if financial markets bid up borrowing rates to unsustainable levels.   Ms. Merkel is preparing to head to Camp David in Maryland for the Group of 8 meeting beginning on Friday, and she is likely to be pressed there by the leaders of other industrial nations, in particular by President Obama, to find a way to quell the turmoil. On Tuesday night she met for the first time with France's newly inaugurated president, Francois Hollande, who campaigned on the need for more growth-promoting policies.   In recent days Ms. Merkel has signaled a growing openness to additional growth measures as long as they do not interfere with the fiscal compact to cut deficits in the euro zone in the long run. ""On the one hand we have the pillar of sound fiscal policy, and the second pillar will then be the growth component,"" Ms. Merkel said in the CNBC interview.   That support could come in the form of money from existing European Union funds that would be redirected for use by crisis countries, said Fabian Zuleeg, the chief economist with the European Policy Center. That approach had been championed by Mr. Hollande.    But it will take more than technical adjustments to calm the growing political opposition to austerity in Greece, Spain and other hard-hit countries in the euro zone's periphery, Mr. Zuleeg added. ""We need to put together a package that looks convincing. It can't just be rhetoric; it has to have some real elements to it,"" he said. ""The real element that certainly has to be in there is money.""   Ms. Merkel's comments punctuated a day in which all sides -- from European policy makers in Brussels to political operatives in Athens, where a caretaker government was named on Wednesday -- began gearing up for a second Greek election, scheduled for June 17. The political establishment in Greece and elsewhere is seeking to describe the vote as a referendum on membership in the euro, which a large majority of Greeks say they support, even as they also demand a renegotiation of the terms of their bailout agreement.   Speaking at an event in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, made a plea for having Greece remain in the euro zone. ""I want to state that our strong preference is that Greece will continue to stay in the euro area,"" Mr. Draghi said.    German officials have been boasting recently about the ability of the euro zone to handle a Greek exit. Though aimed at reining in Greece's left-wing parties and their goal of renegotiating the bailout deal, the talk also unsettled markets and had the potential of turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The perils of brinkmanship in an unstable environment were on full display on Wednesday as the news emerged that Greeks had pulled nearly $900 million in savings from banks in the days after the May 6 elections, prompting fears of an uncontrollable bank run.    The tough talk about Greece's departure from the euro has resulted in growing qualms among the Greek public that their money could be converted to a new, significantly weaker currency -- such as a reintroduced drachma -- shrinking the value of hard-earned nest eggs. The more likely this possibility appears, the more Greeks have an incentive to put their money in bank accounts abroad.   With the continuing instability, the rest of Europe would remain ""in limbo"" waiting for Greek elections, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, ""which for financial markets means one thing: volatility.""   He added, ""We are exactly in the situation where the rumors or the expectations could trigger a downward spiral.""    Mr. Schmieding said that Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande were prepared to make concessions, but had to focus the rest of their energy on preparing to control contagion and cushion the brunt of the impact in the event of a Greek departure.   The high stakes of the second trip to the polls for Greek voters were apparent on Wednesday. ""The Greek people should know what they are voting about,"" said Guido Westerwelle, Germany's foreign minister, in a statement on Wednesday. ""It is not about party politics, but about Greece's future in Europe and the euro. We hope and at the same time also expect that everyone in a decision-making role in Greece is aware of their responsibilities.""   Ms. Merkel has proved time and again how adept she is at shifting with changing circumstances. ""There is a realignment under way, and one thing we know about Ms. Merkel is she is able to manage this sort of transition with very high tactical skills,"" said Nicolas Veron, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.   Voters in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, dealt Ms. Merkel's party a devastating electoral loss on Sunday, which was viewed in part as a repudiation of her emphasis on austerity to the detriment of growth.    But Ms. Merkel's ultimate goal, Mr. Veron said, is to maintain European unity. ""Her primary objective is avoiding a situation where there would be a divide between France and Germany that would be impossible to manage for both nations and would make the whole euro crisis even less manageable than it was before,"" he said.    Jorg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank, said he believed that the European Union was actually more flexible than German politicians had claimed, and could give Greece more time to meet the promised goals to reduce its budget deficits.   ""The political class in Europe still has solidarity with Greek politicians, with the exception of the radical left,"" Mr. Kramer said.    Europe needs to show its support for Greece, Ms. Merkel said in a second televised interview, on CNN, ""as regards growth, as regards employment, as regards development, because what the people in Greece are experiencing now is a very, very tough period.""

2426,2576174970.xml,"Protests took place worldwide, but those in Germany had heightened urgency amid calls for the next government to do something about climate change.BERLIN -- Hundreds of thousands of young people around the world on Friday returned to the streets in the first global climate protest since the coronavirus pandemic forced them into lockdowns.Protesters gathered in Bangladesh, in Kenya, the Netherlands and in many other countries. But nowhere was the call to action more urgent than in Germany, where an estimated several hundred thousand people turned out in more than 400 cities, putting pressure on whoever wins a national election Sunday to put climate protection at the top of their agenda.Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old climate activist who started the Fridays for Future protests in Stockholm in 2018 by skipping school as a way of shaming the world into addressing climate change, made a guest appearance at a protest in Berlin.""Yes, we must vote and you must vote, but remember that voting will not be enough,"" she told the crowd, urging them to stay motivated and keep up the pressure on politicians.""We can still turn this around. People are ready for change,"" she said. ""We demand the change and we are the change.""People of all ages marched through the center of Berlin, then rallied on the lawn before the Reichstag, where Germany's Parliament meets. Thousands turned out for similar protests in other cities across the country.Germans will elect new representatives to Parliament on Sunday, and never before has the issue of climate change played such a role in a German election. Despite entering office with ambitions to reduce carbon emissions in 2005, four successive governments under Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to significantly reduce Germany's carbon footprint. It remains in the top 10 of the world's most polluting countries, according to the World Bank.It has been young climate activists, inspired by Ms. Thunberg, who have succeeded in bringing the climate debate to the forefront of Germany's political discussion. This year, they successfully took the government to court, forcing a 2019 law aimed at bringing the country's carbon emissions down to nearly zero by 2050 to be reworked with more ambitious and detailed goals to reduce emissions through 2030.Recent polls have shown the next German government could include left-leaning environmentalists who many hope will bring real change. The Social Democratic Party has been in the lead for several weeks, ahead of the conservative Christian Democrats, with the Greens firmly in third place, raising hopes that whichever party wins will include them in the next government.But some young Germans are concerned that even the environmentally focused Greens may not enact policy aggressively enough to speed up Germany's exit from coal, currently set for 2038. They are also demanding that Germany speed up its plan to reach climate neutrality, when net carbon emissions hit zero, 10 years earlier than planned, to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower boundary defined in the Paris Agreement.""The last few months have shown how dishonestly the parties have been campaigning on the climate crisis, without even beginning to advocate sufficient measures to combat it,"" said Maia Stimmimg, a spokeswoman for Fridays for Future Germany.""As one of the main polluters, Germany must finally stop the destruction,"" she said. ""Without massive pressure from us on the streets, no coalition will keep the 1.5-degree limit after the election.""Alexandra Petrikat, an entrepreneur and mother of two young children who attended the demonstration in Berlin, said she was impressed by how peaceful and respectful the protesters were. At the same time, she said their message was loud and clear.""I think that we sent a signal that whoever forms the next government can't close their eyes to our demands,"" Ms. Petrikat said. ""We will not give up. We will keep growing  and we will keep up the pressure.""Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Christopher F.

3753,1625411386.xml,"       On the eve of his exhibition at the new Fondation Louis Vuitton, Olafur Eliasson discusses his work - which includes a school, an architecture practice, a charity, a cookbook and a herd of Icelandic sheep, and which is meant to make the world a better place. Really. ""IRONY OR NOT?"" said Olafur Eliasson, looking around the meeting table. At his studio in Berlin, the answer is almost invariably ""not,"" but perhaps here an exception could be made. Eliasson and a few of his staff were finalizing the title of a new book chronicling the five-year history of the Institut für Raumexperimente, a small art school that Eliasson ran until February. The title under consideration was ""How to Make the Best Art School in the World."" ""It would be nice to piss off the very academic art schools,"" Eliasson said. ""I do think we had the best students in the world. But is irony really the economy I want to support?"" In the end, Eliasson and his staff agreed that such good-natured braggadocio was pretty harmless in irony terms, although the cover would be designed so that at first glance the book would appear to be titled simply ""How to Make."" Eliasson had also ensured that the book would include a photograph of a puppy that one of the students had met on a field trip. ""Every book should have a picture of a puppy in it,"" he told me, ""because it just makes you so happy."" If, like me, you operate under the assumption that irony is automatically more sophisticated than earnestness, it is confounding to enter Eliasson's world. One of the most extensive private holdings of his work belongs to the advertising executive Christian Boros, whose appointment-only museum in the Mitte district, the Boros Collection, was originally built as a Nazi air-raid shelter but over the years has also functioned as a banana warehouse and a notoriously debauched techno club. This is the nature of Berlin, where things cascade with contradictory meanings, where ""post-"" is a ubiquitous prefix, where hipsters chase oblivion in the ruins of old dogmas. Irony is almost always a safe bet here, not least in the expat art scene. So you arrive at Studio Olafur Eliasson with certain expectations, and when you find that, on the contrary, it is one of the most earnest places you have ever been, you start looking around for the cracks. Eliasson was born in Copenhagen to Icelandic parents in 1967. His most celebrated work to date is 2003's ""The weather project,"" for which the Turbine Hall of London's Tate Modern was converted into a gigantic, artificial solarium, attracting over the course of six months two million visitors, who often felt compelled to lie down on the floor, spelling out political messages with their bodies or just gazing at themselves and each other in the mirror on the ceiling. My own favorite work of Eliasson's is ""Your waste of time,"" an installation at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City last year that consisted of several chunks of ice, detached by seasonal melting from an Icelandic glacier, that had been fished out of a lake, shipped to New York and installed in the refrigerated gallery. There they sat for nearly four months, crystalline but also surprisingly grimy, stout as rock but also frail enough to need their own microclimate - individual and real and lost. A lot of Eliasson's works are like this: irruptions of the elemental into a museum setting, as if the building had sprung some mythic leak. Others are harder to convey in a high-concept pitch. When I visited the studio, Eliasson was working on a commission for the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a major new museum that opened in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris last month. In addition to taking over the ground floor for the Fondation's inaugural temporary show, he would be constructing a permanent ""grotto"" from which the Frank Gehry-designed building could be flatteringly viewed. Although Eliasson showed me plenty of sketches and models for the exhibition, I never quite formed a clear idea of what he was planning to do, apart from that it involved mirrors and curves and tinted glass. This side of Eliasson's practice takes the form of a highly refined fun house, subjecting you to experiments in human perception that don't sound like much until you see them firsthand. The intended effect often seems to be a pre-intellectual wonder, so that you will have basically the same experience as the 5-year-old next to you. There's a reason why Eliasson feels an imperative to appeal to the broadest possible audience. He believes that in normal life we have a tendency to hurry along on autopilot, seldom questioning our deeper assumptions. Art, by goosing the senses, can make us more conscious of our positions in time, space, hierarchy, society, culture, the planet. In the long run, this heightened consciousness will result in change for the better - emotionally, socially, politically. In other words, Eliasson has a faith in the improving power of art that has been out of fashion since Victorian times. But his ambitions aren't bounded by his studio. He is on friendly terms with Bill Gates, Kofi Annan and Michael Bloomberg, and regularly attends the World Economic Forum in Davos to discuss public policy with the people who make it. ""I don't go there to meet world leaders,"" he joked. ""I go to become a world leader!"" In fact, he already talks like a politician much of the time, with a habit of disappearing into a haze of generalities and wonk-speak and anecdotes of uncertain relevance. The concepts he draws on - inclusivity and engagement and trust and so on - seem to have been filtered to ensure that you could no more be offended by his statements than you could be offended by the colored lights he puts in museums. Yes, he has given a TED talk. And yet the longer I spent with Eliasson, the harder I found it to cling to my cynicism, because he's such a good advertisement for sincerity. One of Eliasson's friends, the author Jonathan Safran Foer, told me over the phone that he found spending time with Eliasson ""overwhelming, whether overwhelming in the sense of at times feeling almost too much, or overwhelming in the sense of being really moving. You sit down with Olafur for a meal and he picks up the fork and stares at it for a moment and you think, Oh my god, he's either inventing a new fork or wondering how to get forks to people who don't have forks. "" He added: ""After I've spent an hour with him I feel like I need a nap, but it's because he has more curiosity than anyone I've ever met, and a greater belief in a person's ability to be useful and to change things. Somehow he lives his entire life with the urgency of someone who just walked out of the doctor's office with a dire prognosis."" Eliasson has 90 people working for him. Few of them have job titles. Four days a week they all eat a healthy vegetarian lunch together in the light-filled canteen upstairs, with a rotating schedule for washing the dishes afterward. Initially, I found the atmosphere at the studio rather too good to be true, like a hippie cult before night falls. But when I joined Eliasson for lunch on my second day at the studio, I sat there eating my roasted carrots and enviously contemplating how much better my life would be if I, too, received that bounty of vegetables and sunlight and intelligent chatter. Sebastian Behmann, who heads Eliasson's architecture practice, told me that you can track how long someone has worked at Studio Olafur Eliasson by how much healthier they look every year (and indeed many people have stayed on for a decade or more). Last year, Studio Olafur Eliasson published its own 368-page cookbook of sustainable vegetarian recipes. This is just one of the unpredictable byproducts of the studio, which often resembles a sort of ongoing Apollo project. Others have included the art school, a full-scale architecture practice, a series of publications, a charity and a herd of Icelandic sheep. As motley as these pursuits may sound, Eliasson would argue that they all emerge from a single mind-set, and that they've all been made viable by his years of practical experience as an artist. ""If you can make a show in Venice, which is the most difficult damned thing one can do, not just because working with Italians is a mess, but also because you're in a city on water in the middle of nowhere and getting a hammer and a nail is impossible ... you can make a show on the moon,"" he told me. ""So as an artist, you become an entrepreneur by definition.... The art world underestimates its own relevance when it insists on always staying inside the art world. Maybe one can take some of the tools, methodologies, and see if one can apply them to something outside the art world."" For instance, sheep. ""It started with the financial crisis,"" Eliasson told me when I asked about his herd. ""Björk said everybody must think innovatively. So we started buying up lambs to rescue the Icelandic economy - but I think we ended up burdening it! My mistake was I wanted to turn it into an art project. Still, it was a nice excuse to go to the countryside and drink vodka and play with the sheep."" Eliasson began breeding lambs whose meat would be particularly well-suited to Moroccan tagines, with the intention of selling diced, marinated lamb to delis in Iceland. ""I just couldn't convince my partners that people in Iceland would eat tagine."" In the end, the lambs were slaughtered, their meat frozen and their wool knitted into 20 ""secular prayer mats."" Other ventures have been less quixotic. After they adopted two children from Addis Ababa, Eliasson and his wife, the art historian Marianne Krogh Jensen, started 121 Ethiopia, a project that works to improve the lives of children in Ethiopian orphanages. 121 Ethiopia operates on a modest scale. Little Sun, Eliasson's other philanthropic enterprise, does not. Developed with the Danish engineer Frederik Ottesen, the Little Sun is a very efficient solar-powered LED lamp, cheerful in design and lightweight enough to wear around the neck on a lanyard. Since the lamp's debut in 2012, more than 200,000 have been distributed, over a third of them to regions in Africa with no electricity, the rest at venues like Tate Modern or Coachella. While Eliasson was still discussing the Institut für Raumexperimente book, I was taken upstairs to the Little Sun workshop to meet Felix Tristan Hallwachs, who heads the project. ""We're not going to solve the Ukraine crisis, we're not going to solve IS [Islamic State],"" he said. ""But in theory if everyone has a light at home and can study, then you have less chaos in the world, probably."" If there isn't much irony at Studio Olafur Eliasson, I came to feel, it's not because irony is proscribed. Irony doesn't offend anyone and it doesn't go over anyone's head. Irony is simply not required, because the things you can achieve with crusading sincerity are self-evidently so much better. At worst, you could argue that Little Sun makes Eliasson's talk about the power of museum art look a bit vaporous by comparison. But at Studio Olafur Eliasson the distinction between art and direct intervention is barely even recognized. Hallwachs told me: ""Olafur's work uses media from photography to oil paint to all kinds of installations and architecture. Now business is part of the range of media as well."" Eliasson told me that he was hoping to present a work at the next G7 conference that would evaluate the German public's degree of trust in Chancellor Angela Merkel and perhaps in the process inspire a renewal of the European relationship with Africa. I asked him whether, in order to achieve such an ambitious and specific political objective he would need to make a new type of work, something more targeted, more explicit. Possibly, he replied - but he would be just as likely to bring along something like ""Riverbed,"" which consists of a riparian landscape constructed inside the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen from 180 tons of Icelandic bluestone. For Eliasson, art need never be marginal, and art need never be just a carrier for a message. Art can change the world with the sheer intensity of its art-ness. Or, perhaps, by helping to get the artist in a room with the energy minister of Nigeria. If Eliasson had his way, the same ""everyone's invited!"" quality that makes his work so appealing to institutions might sometimes be pushed to extremes that would leave even those institutions flustered. Before I left the studio, I related to Eliasson something that happened to me in July last year at Warm Up, the Saturday afternoon dance party held in the courtyard of MoMA PS1. It was oppressively hot and muggy on the outdoor dance floor, and halfway through the afternoon I had the idea of going inside to spend a few minutes with ""Your waste of time,"" the piece with the chunks of ice, to cool off. Arriving at the gallery, however, my friends and I found that it had been locked for the duration of the event, so we could do no more than press ourselves against the chilly door. When I told Eliasson this story, he looked genuinely pained. ""What a pity!"" he kept saying. ""What a pity! I would have left that door open."" But would he really have wanted drunken revelers slithering over this ancient ice that he'd imported from thousands of miles away? ""If the ice melts and disappears - well, maybe it's beautiful that there was once an iceberg, and then there was a party and now the iceberg is gone."" He pointed out that this would have been an excellent metaphor for man-made climate change. ""People underestimate how robust art is."" He added: ""If we don't believe that creativity as a language can be as powerful as the language of the politicians, we would be very sad - and I would have failed. I am convinced that creativity is a fierce weapon."" 'You sit down with Olafur for a meal,' says Jonathan Safran Foer, 'and he picks up the fork and stares at it for a moment and you think, Oh my god, he's either inventing a new fork or wondering how to get forks to people who don't have forks.' ""Inside the Horizon,"" a specially commissioned grotto by Olafur Eliasson, is now on view at the Frank Gehry-designed Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. An exhibition of Eliasson's work, the inaugural show at the Fondation, will open on Dec. 17 and run until Feb. 16, 2015.  ",2014-11-16

1926,1014204667.xml,"      BERLIN -- A telephone conversation on Friday between Germany's chancellor and Greece's president became the latest flashpoint in the war of words between Berlin and Athens in the unfolding crisis over Greece's membership in the euro.    All sides agree that Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone with President Karolos Papoulias on Friday. A spokesman for the caretaker government, Dimitris Tsiodras, said Ms. Merkel ""conveyed to the president thoughts regarding a referendum that could be conducted in parallel to the elections, asking Greeks whether they want to remain in the euro zone.""    A spokesman for Ms. Merkel's government swiftly denied she had called for a referendum, but not before Greek politicians blasted the alleged proposal. The leftist leader Alexis Tsipras accused her of treating Greece like a ""protectorate."" The Socialist Party stated that ""referendums fall exclusively within the competencies of the government and the Greek Parliament, not the EU or other member states.""   The Greek conservative leader Antonis Samaras called it ""unacceptable"" for Germany's chancellor to issue such a proposal.   The quick condemnation from Greek politicians illustrated unequivocally how raw feelings are in Athens over questions of sovereignty and underscored how the uncertainty over Greece's future has turned rumors and unconfirmed reports into fuel for even more heated exchanges. The dispute was only the latest fallout from the instability in Greece, which continued to roil markets across Europe.    Top European officials also contradicted each other Friday over planning for the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro. In the meantime a leading ratings agency downgraded 16 Spanish lenders.   With a caretaker government now in place and only four weeks to go until the next round of parliamentary elections in Athens, a broad effort is underway by Germany and its European partners to make it clear to Greek voters exactly what is at stake when they cast ballots on June 17.    Germany finds itself in a delicate position, not wanting to encourage the opposition forces in Athens that failed to form a government after the last election by appearing to interfere in the election, while simultaneously using all possible channels to communicate to Greek voters that their country's future in the 17-member euro zone depends on electing a government that will uphold its loan agreement with the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.    Comments by a European Union official, who joined businesses and financial firms in signaling that contingency plans are being drafted to deal with the potential fallout of a Greek exit, pointed to how real the readiness to cut Greece loose may be. ""Today there are, both within the European Central Bank and the European Commission, services that are working on emergency scenarios in case Greece doesn't make it,"" the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said in an interview published Friday in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard.   Mr. De Gucht's comments prompted a rare public rebuke from a colleague, illustrating how the raw nerves are not just in Athens over the uncertainty surrounding Greece, which saw its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by Fitch Ratings late Thursday, on concern over a lack of public and political support for the country's bailout.    ""Karel De Gucht is responsible for trade. I am responsible for financial and economic affairs and relations with the E.C.B.,"" the vice president of the European Union Commission, Olli Rehn, said during an event in London. ""We are not working on the scenario of a Greek exit. We are working on the basis of a scenario of Greece staying in.""   European Union offices in Brussels were closed Friday and a spokesman for Mr. De Gucht could not be immediately reached for comment.    While continued support for Athens remains the official line, many influential people in Germany would like to see Greece driven from the euro zone, some as an example to other countries and others for what they say is its own good chance to recover. If Syriza, the party that opposes the terms of Greece's current bailout plan, were to come out ahead in the next election and overplays its hand, it could find itself with an invitation to leave.   Shares in Spanish banks fell at the opening of trading, Reuters reported, after the ratings agency Moody's downgraded 16 lenders late Thursday, citing a weak economy and the government's reduced ability to support troubled lenders.   ""There is a good argument for the view that Greece is the basket case -- to be very frank and plain -- get rid of them and the other countries' politics and economics are much sounder,"" said Jurgen Matthes, senior economist at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research.    Rumors of a Spanish bank run this week show how delicate the situation in Europe has become, leading to a series of public comments by leaders that appeared intended to calm the situation and perhaps hold out a little hope to Greek voters. Earlier this week, Ms. Merkel suggested in a television interview her openness to stimulus programs for Greece.    ""In early 2010 you could be skeptical but I think in the meantime the politicians, the ministries, have talked to the financial markets,"" Mr. Matthes said. ""The awareness of the dangers of contagion effect is much bigger.""   The leaders of the world's top economies will meet this weekend at Camp David. Ms. Merkel is expected to come under significant pressure to buoy the Greek economy and prevent an unpredictable exit from the euro zone, and resulting contagion that could snuff out the recovery of the United States economy, not to mention destabilize the world financial system.   But opinion surveys show that German voters continue to support the chancellor's tough line on austerity abroad, even if they did chasten her party for pursuing it at home in recent regional elections.    Ms. Merkel's soothing words on growth and even the possibility of stimulus are not, many experts here say, intended for Greece so much as President Francois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy. Greece's fate is in its own hands, Ms. Merkel and her advisers have repeatedly said, and there is every reason to believe that they mean it.   The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, was in Athens on Friday, where he told German public radio, ""I consider the whole speculation over whether Greece should be written off not without danger.""   As a representative of a European institution, Mr. Schulz, a German and a Social Democrat, felt freer to engage in direct political dialogue with Greeks. ""Those who are telling you, 'We don't have to pay anything back, we don't have to restructure, the Europeans will keep paying,' they are leading you into a disaster.""   German officials have tried to exert pressure on the Greeks without appearing to meddle in the domestic political process. The German media have shown little compunction.    The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, an influential daily newspaper, ran an editorial on the front page calling the last Greek election ""just the overture,"" and stating that Greek voters needed to understand that the upcoming return to the polls would be ""a referendum on the question of whether the Greeks would stay in the euro zone or not.""   The article seemed written to push Greek buttons, saying that with a return to the old drachma currency, Greece would be ""an upmarket Bulgaria,"" referring to Greece's neighbor, which after decades of Communist rule lagged far behind Greece in its development. Even after leaving the euro, Greece could still receive aid, but it would no longer be credits but instead ""a form of humanitarian emergency aid.""   Finally the paper said ""hopefully one won't have to consider an international protection force,"" as in countries to the north, referring presumably to Bosnia and Kosovo.

1335,434243216.xml,"      With France joining Britain in proposing a steep tax on bank bonuses, Goldman Sachs moved on Thursday to quell the uproar over its resurgent profits and pay.    Bowing to calls for restraint in tough economic times, Goldman said that its most senior executives would forgo cash bonuses this year. Instead, the 30 executives will be paid in the form of long-term stock -- an arrangement that means they will not get big year-end paydays, but one that could turn out to be enormously lucrative if Goldman's share price rises over time.     The move is meant to address concerns that bankers and traders in the past benefited from short-term performance. The shift at Goldman locks up the executives' rewards for five years and enables Goldman to claw back the bonuses in the event the bank's business sours.     Goldman did not say how much it would pay the executives, suggesting the bank would continue a practice -- widely followed in investment banking -- of allocating roughly half its annual revenue for compensation. While their bonuses will be paid in long-term stock, the payouts are likely to be worth many millions of dollars.    It is uncertain if the move, which applies only to a small number of Goldman employees, will be enough to placate critics of Wall Street, including some policy makers in Washington, where Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master of compensation, will release new pay rulings on Friday.    ""We're starting to see some firms adopt compensation structures and policies that are in the direction of the principles that the president and Feinberg have been articulating, but we have a long way to go,"" said Neal Wolin, deputy secretary of the Treasury.     A year after the government rescued the financial system with billions of taxpayer dollars, banks are preparing to pay out annual bonuses that could rival those of the bubble years. Nowhere is the bonanza expected to be bigger than at Goldman Sachs, which so far this year has set aside a record $16.7 billion to pay its workers, or roughly $700,000 per employee.    With even once-beleaguered giants like Bank of America now extricating themselves from the federal bailout program, Mr. Feinberg, who has advocated for banks to pay bonuses entirely in stock, is losing much of his power. Mr. Feinberg is expected to announce on Friday that he will cap the pay of a cohort of workers at the six companies still under his purview at $500,000 and require that half their pay be deferred for three years, according to a person familiar with the matter.    Most big banks, however, are now free to pay their employees as they see fit, now that they have repaid their bailout funds. To Wall Street critics and, indeed, many ordinary Americans, the prospect of a new era of Wall Street wealth, so soon after the financial collapse, and with so many people out of work, seems shocking. Some see the coming round of bonuses as evidence that policy makers failed to reform pay practices that in, some cases, fostered the risky businesses that lead to the financial crisis in the first place.     ""There's a universal discomfort with the levels of compensation we're seeing in the financial system,"" said Jonathan Koppell, a professor of public policy at the Yale School of Management. ""The idea that private institutions should be walled out from government intervention is harder to swallow when in the last year government intervention was quite welcome in the form of billions of dollars in bailouts.""   Many on Wall Street were waiting anxiously to see what Goldman would do. Goldman is enjoying one of the most profitable years in its 140-year history, and its rapid recovery has made the bank a lightning rod.    Much of the resentment has been directed at Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who after first staunchly defending the bank's profits and pay, and then bristling at calls for restraint, apologized for mistakes that led to the financial crisis.    Mr. Blankfein declined a bonus last year. In 2007, he was paid about $67.5 million, a Wall Street record. This year, he and 29 other top executives will receive bonuses that could be quite large, but they will be in the form of what Goldman called ""shares at risk,"" or stock that cannot be sold for five years and can be retracted if the executive does something that hurts the firm. Goldman has long paid a portion of bonuses in stock.    Goldman also announced on Thursday that, for the first time, it would give its shareholders a say in determining compensation. The vote would be nonbinding, however.    The shift atop Goldman will not prevent Goldman employees in France and Britain from falling subject to a one-time windfall tax in those countries. After the British chancellor of the Exchequer proposed such a tax earlier this week, French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, threw her support behind a similar tax on Thursday and, in an interview, she said she hoped that other countries would follow suit. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, described the tax as an ""attractive idea"" in a speech in Bonn, Germany.   Mr. Feinberg's domain, meantime, is shrinking rapidly. Bank of America paid back its bailout money on Wednesday and only its top 25 workers whose pay Mr. Feinberg ruled on in October will be subject to his mandates this year. In recent days, Citigroup, too, has been trying to cut its lifeline to Washington in part to protect its workers from Mr. Feinberg's rulings on Friday.   ""Ken Feinberg has had more of an impact of driving people out of the bailout than on compensation,"" said Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School. ""His job in large part is like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.""   If Citigroup returns the bailout funds, only the American International Group, the Detroit automakers and their related finance companies would be subject to Mr. Feinberg's rules. And at Chrysler and General Motors, few workers earn more than $500,000 in any case. Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner, at Compensation Advisory Partners in New York, said the resentment directed at Wall Street was unlikely to let up as long as the economy remains weak.    The outcry, she said, ""has reached a crescendo as it related to the financial crisis, and we're not out of that. We are still highly sensitized to the role the organizations played and to the role that compensation played.""

1361,1708404702.xml,"       The arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from war-torn regions of Africa and the Middle East, as well as economic migrants from Africa and Asia, is testing the European Union as no other recent crisis has. As the human toll mounts -- more than 2,500 have died so far this year -- so does the moral pressure on Europe to act. On Friday, after 71 people were found suffocated in a truck in Austria and 150 others drowned off the coast of Libya, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was ""horrified and heartbroken at the latest loss of lives."" The roots of this catastrophe lie in crises the European Union cannot solve alone: war in Syria and Iraq, chaos in Libya, destitution and brutal regimes in Africa. But the European Union's failed asylum policies cannot escape blame for the suffering of thousands of people seeking to escape these crises. As things stand now, Europe offers few legal avenues to refugees, and in their absence, criminal human-smuggling gangs have flourished, promising passage in a rickety boat or a refrigerated truck for a price that too often includes the lives of those they transport. The European Union's Dublin Regulation is a big part of the problem. The regulation, with origins in the 1990s, requires refugees to apply for asylum in the first country they reach. This has unfairly burdened the two countries on the Mediterranean front lines, Italy and Greece. Germany, to its credit, effectively dropped the regulation last week and will allow Syrian refugees to apply for asylum no matter where they first entered Europe. But Germany is already scheduled to absorb 800,000 refugees this year, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has made it clear the rest of Europe must also do its share. Germany, Britain and France have now called for an emergency meeting on Sept. 14 of European Union ministers to find solutions to the crisis. An early order of business should be to scrap the Dublin Regulation. Beyond that, the ministers should give the most serious consideration to a broader 10-point immigration reform plan proposed last week by Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Sigmar Gabriel, the vice chancellor and economics minister. Among the proposals are a common asylum code, fair distribution of refugees among member states, aid to countries strained by the crisis and enforced marine rescue operations on the Mediterranean. Something must be done, and soon, not only for the refugees but also for the political stability of the European Union. The human tsunami and the absence of a coherent response to it has fueled Europe's xenophobic right and caused discord among the union's 28 member states. Meanwhile, the blame game escalates. France has hardly been hospitable to refugees, but on Sunday, its foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, sharply criticized Hungary for the fence it is constructing along its border with Serbia to keep refugees out. Hungary initially blocked hundreds of refugees and migrants at Budapest's Keleti railway station who want to travel to Germany -- though it is now reportedly allowing some through -- a move blamed for the rise in the kind of desperate efforts that appear to have led to the death of the 71 people found in the truck in Austria. More of the same is likely unless Europe can provide a humane alternative to the smugglers. Credit: THE EDITORIAL BOARD  ",2015-09-01
3572,1035366118.xml,"       PANTSUITS ARE BACK IN POWER. BY SUZY MENKES I think I probably gasped when I saw pantsuits - real jacket-and-trouser looks-follow one after the other down the fall runway of the usually girly Miu Miu line. ""Why pantsuits?"" I asked Miuccia Prada after she had taken a bow wearing not her signature A-line skirt but a this-must-be-vintage-1980s black cloqué jacket and trousers. ""I love it after all these years of wearing skirts,"" claimed the designer who got us out of the feminist uniform of pants in the early 1990s. Hemlines became hip, and I still remember the crescendo of skirts that I saw in a ""Waist Down"" exhibition in Prada's Tokyo store in 2004. Now Prada is leading a pants revival, with the modernity coming through in the textiles, like jacquard fabrics and typical Prada patterns - part paisley, part 1970s curtains. At the start of the fall fashion shows in New York in February, I headlined an article I wrote for the International Herald Tribune with the question: ""Where Have All the Trousers Gone?"" I was lamenting the loss of that rangy American sportswear basic - zapped by skinny jeans and leggings. Being of the 1980s generation, like Prada herself, I may have been inwardly longing for those easy-to-pack travel moments when a couple of pantsuits from Yves Saint Laurent, Yohji Yamamoto and Giorgio Armani could take you everywhere. Simple tops, a blouse with a pussycat bow and that was it. Think like a man! No check-in bags, just a carry-on with flats and medium heels and a spare suit in a folding cover. Who spoiled all that? John Galliano, maybe, with those gorgeous, wispy chiffon dresses worn with visible underpants (but only on the runway). Suddenly the cardigan was the new jacket. The glass ceiling was smashed, and it actually seemed more powerful for a woman to tiptoe through the debris in kitten heels with a chiffon dress or full skirt and that little cardi. Then Phoebe Philo, at Céline, made her 21st-century pitch for pants. Her full-on endorsement for trousers has made many 30-something women rethink ""power"" dressing. And it has opened up the possibility of wearing pants in different ways. By the end of the recent fall collections, Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada had all endorsed a new look: trousers under dresses, under coats. In their layering, with a perfume of Arabia, the idea seemed fresh and intriguing. The tuxedo also has gotten another look, perhaps because of the return to Yves Saint Laurent of Hedi Slimane, who cut his design teeth on YSL men's wear. I looked again recently at Helmut Newton's 1975 iconic, sexually perverse images of Saint Laurent's ""Le Smoking"" at an exhibition in Paris, and I still got a frisson of the sexual power of androgyny. And I thought Gwyneth Paltrow looked fabulous at an Oscar party in Los Angeles in February wearing a plunge-front black jumpsuit from Boy by Band of Outsiders - the tux as antidote to the red-carpet dress. Yet are young woman really ready for the matchy-matchy trouser suit worn by politicos like Hillary Clinton, 64, and Angela Merkel, 58? As first lady, the more fashion-conscious Michelle Obama, 48, has pointedly abandoned the jacket and trousers she wore as a lawyer in favor of dresses and cardigans. Maybe the rise of city shorts, worn under a jacket and with thick hose, is a first step toward the revenge of pants on skirts. I loved that Guillaume Henry at Carven put fur lapels on a camel shorts suit, giving tailoring the freshness of his generation. Then there are the page-boy, over-the-knee pants, as seen at Marc Jacobs and Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel resort collection. If there really is to be a return to tailored pants, the distinction will be footwear. Whether flats, kitten heels or platforms, an haute stride might make all the difference in raising trouser suits back to the height of fashion. Leg work The pants revival brings with it shorts, tuxedos and trousers worn under coats and dresses.  ",2012-08-19
1943,901287794.xml,"      PARIS -- The crisis of the euro zone has finally hit the potholed road of real politics, with the Greeks now openly questioning whether their commitment to Europe and its single currency still matters more to them than control over their own future and economic well-being.   During the two-year financial crisis, the wealthier countries of northern Europe, led by Germany, have insisted that their heavily indebted brethren in the south radically cut spending in return for emergency loans. They have stuck to that prescription even though austerity has undermined growth and increased unemployment in Greece, Spain, Portugal and now Italy, betting that people in those countries will swallow the harsh medicine because their only alternative is to default and possibly leave the euro zone altogether.   The turmoil in the government of Prime Minister George A. Papandreou means that Greece is about to call that bet. Many Greek politicians appear to be calculating, at this late stage, that they have more to lose by sticking to Germany's terms than by risking a messy default, and even going it alone with their old currency, the drachma, outside the euro zone.   Austerity, in other words, is facing its first really big political test.   ""This is clearly the return of politics,"" said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, an economic research institution in Brussels. ""The management of all this by the Europeans has been fairly technocratic. But now we see the gamble of a politician, which creates uncertainty again, but in a different form. But it was bound to come at some point.""   Mr. Papandreou's decision to press for a popular referendum on the bailout was the inevitable result of Greece's loss of sovereignty to Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, professor of economics at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France were acting as if they were the real government of Greece, he said.   ""It's as if the Europeans -- or Merkel and Sarkozy alone -- believed that they were in control of the people of Greece,"" Mr. Fitoussi said. ""But this is a democracy. In Greece, and even in Italy, you cannot expect to rule without the support and consent of the people. And you can't impose an austerity program for a decade on a country, and even choose for them the austerity measures that country must implement.""   As the crisis has unfolded, this tension has only increased. Complex bailout packages are hammered out by officials in secret, then are usually sent to parliamentary majorities for approval, without much recourse to the democratic voters of the 17 European Union countries that use the euro, all of which must approve each package.   As a result, the entire euro zone has found itself periodically at the mercy of seemingly minor events -- the fall of the Slovak government, a court ruling in Germany, a possible referendum in Greece -- that threaten to bring down the whole structure and wreak havoc in financial markets worldwide.    The combination of back-room deals and ad-hoc parliamentary approvals is necessary because the European project is essentially incomplete. The 17 countries that use the euro do not have common fiscal policies or political leadership, and have widely varying levels of development. They have a common central bank, but its mandate is far more limited than that of the United States Federal Reserve, which has intervened much more aggressively in the markets to shore up troubled American financial institutions.   That has left euro zone leaders struggling to cobble together rescue packages big enough to reassure markets but small enough to pass muster with their own reluctant voters. Both voters and markets remain deeply skeptical.   For some time now, experts have been wondering at what point Europe would reach its ""Lehman moment"" in the crisis, that point where the problem can no longer be addressed with half measures. If Greece, faced with a second bailout and another set of austerity demands, now says ""Enough,"" that point may be reached, forcing a choice between a smaller euro zone or a softer, longer-term rescue policy that emphasizes growth.    A Greek rejection of the deal could at the very least put new pressure on the European Central Bank to continue to prop up heavily indebted nations by buying their debt or even becoming a lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve. That is a step that is anathema to Germans, who see it as violating European treaties to benefit irresponsible nations. But treaties can be changed, and Mr. Sarkozy still considers the bank to be the best answer to the problem of how to set up a firewall to protect the vulnerable while they try to fix themselves.   Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy are clearly irritated with Greece, but so far they insist that the restructuring deal agreed upon Thursday in Brussels remains, as Mr. Sarkozy said Tuesday, ""the only possible path to resolve the Greek debt problem.""    But Greece's turmoil has the makings of a turning point. Greek elections during a deep economic slump would be likely to usher in a government that would, at a minimum, to try to renegotiate the bailout deal with European and foreign lenders, a messy process that would force Germany and other European lenders to decide how strictly to stick to their austerity formula. The uncertainty would undermine confidence in other indebted countries like Italy at a time they can ill afford it.   There is also the possibility that an election or a popular referendum would pose the question more bluntly, with Greeks essentially deciding whether they want to stick with the euro or not -- if they want to put sovereignty over their own affairs ahead of membership in the common currency. That could mean the fraying, or at least the shrinking, of the euro zone.    Mr. Fitoussi believes that Greeks had no choice but to ask themselves that question. ""There are only two possibilities in a democracy: the government has to resign or consult the people,"" he said. ""Of course, I don't know which is the worst for Europe.""

2316,1655159838.xml,"       ARTEMIVSK, Ukraine --  A fragile, European-brokered cease-fire deal for Ukraine appeared at risk of unraveling, at least in part, when a rebel leader announced Saturday night that he would not be bound by the accord on a central battlefield of the war. Although the Ukrainian president and the pro-Russian rebel leader both announced that the cease-fire had gone into effect, the separatist leader said it did not apply to Debaltseve, where thousands of Ukrainian troops have been under siege and might be surrounded. The rebel leader, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, said the town, a critical railway hub, had not been mentioned specifically in the cease-fire agreement. That deal, which went into effect at midnight, had been brokered by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the French president, François Hollande, in Minsk, Belarus. Neither leader immediately commented on Mr. Zakharchenko's announcement about Debaltseve, which had been the scene of intense fighting in recent days as the rebels battled to take the town before any cease-fire. Just after the midnight deadline, Ukraine's president, Petro O. Poroshenko, went on national television saying he had ordered Ukraine's armed forces to halt their fire in the contested eastern portion of the country. In his earlier statement, Mr. Zakharchenko, the head of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, also said he had ordered his forces to halt combat all along the front line in eastern Ukraine, as required in the Minsk agreement, but not near Debaltseve. He also indicated that rebel forces would not allow the approximately 8,000 Ukrainian troops who are there to leave.  ""We will block all attempts to break out,"" he said. ""I have given the order."" The statement left a looming question about the future of the accord brokered Thursday with great effort by the European leaders, including 16 hours of overnight negotiations between Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Poroshenko.  The cease-fire is the second such attempt to end a war that has claimed more than 5,400 lives since it began in April. Although Mr. Poroshenko said he had ordered the cease-fire, he added that Ukraine would not ""turn the other cheek"" if the other side violated the agreement, and he spoke bitterly of the two-and-a-half-day gap between the signing of the accord and the implementation of the cease-fire. ""We were ready for an immediate cease-fire in Minsk,"" he said. ""But our counterparties asked for 60 hours. We paid a very heavy price for these 60 hours because dozens of Ukrainian citizens, including women and children, were killed."" Ukrainian forces also continued fighting until the cease-fire went into effect. Mr. Poroshenko urged the other leaders who had been involved in the talks to now ensure that the rest of the agreement was upheld. Within hours, reports emerged of possible cease-fire violations, including mortar fire near Debaltseve. But residents reached by phone in two cities with fighting on their outskirts, Donetsk and Mariupol, said all was calm.  From the cease-fire's signing on Thursday until Saturday, the Ukrainian military reported 18 soldiers were killed and 63 wounded. At least four children were among the civilians who died in the recent fighting.  The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine issued a statement on Saturday evening carried by the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper saying Mr. Zakharchenko's comments signaled that, ""In this way, the Donetsk People's Republic announces it does not recognize the Minsk accord and will continue military action."" Mr. Poroshenko said Saturday he would ask the Ukrainian Parliament to declare a national state of martial law if the cease-fire broke down. Russian-backed militants and Mr. Putin have insisted that Debaltseve is surrounded; the Ukrainian government has not conceded that point. The only Ukrainian resupply road into the town is peppered with mines and in the range of artillery by both sides, and it is unclear who is in control.  Even before Mr. Zakharchenko announced the accord did not apply to Debaltseve, anger had been swelling among Ukrainian soldiers at a negotiated lag between the signing of the agreement and its implementation.  Fighting raged through the day on Saturday. Both sides had tried to land final blows before midnight. Shells killed two people in the rebel-held city of Donetsk. Soldiers interviewed at their sandbagged positions along the contested road, as well as ambulance crews and doctors, expressed rising anger over the agreement that led not to a hoped-for calm, but an escalation in fighting. The poorly guarded, 31-mile supply road into Debaltseve on Saturday was shrouded in an eerie mist and rimmed by bare trees, their limbs prickly with glistening hoarfrost. Through the day, ambulances rushed to a hospital carrying from the fight the wounded whose luck ran out hours before the accord was intended to take effect. ""The cease-fire was a political decision by my government,"" Oksana D. Yarosh, a Ukrainian military surgeon, said in an interview outside the Artemivsk Central Regional hospital, where the most gravely injured are evaluated. She could not judge the decision to leave open the window for a final frenzy of fighting, she said, because it was unclear what other options existed. ""I am a military doctor,"" she said. ""I serve, and my service is trying to save lives and health. Personally, it has been very painful for me to see the boys with shrapnel wounds."" One of her patients, a 32-year-old soldier, came in Thursday night with severe shrapnel wounds to his face, and his right elbow had been so severely wounded that his arm would probably have to be amputated below the joint, though she refrained from doing so immediately. ""His life will never be the same,"" Dr. Yarosh said. ""I think, 'How horrible is war.' And I think, 'How scary that we lose people in this way.' It's been difficult."" The United States on Friday said that Russian artillery was aiding the separatists in the battle to encircle the town, site of a strategic railroad switching yard. On Saturday, the American ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, posted satellite images on his Twitter account to bolster the case that Russia had joined the separatists. One image seemed to show four gun lines of towed artillery and one of self-propelled artillery northeast of Debaltseve, in a landscape in snowy towns of gray. Another showed what Mr. Pyatt said were air-defense systems, and the third showed the black, streaky exhaust plumes of what was labeled a ""Russian multiple rocket launcher deployment"" near Shakhtar, Ukraine. A medic reached on Saturday by cellphone in Debaltseve, Albert Sardaryen, a 22-year-old who left his university to volunteer with an ambulance crew, said the city had been attacked by Grad rockets through the night Friday, but that the firing let up around 11 a.m. on Saturday. Soldiers were hunkered down in basements or bunkers, he said. The scale of the casualties was unclear, he said, because many of the wounded could not be taken from their front-line positions to his field hospital.  The last ambulance left Debaltseve on Thursday evening, before the escalation that followed the cease-fire signing. ""The situation is quite difficult,"" Mr. Sardaryen said. ""We don't believe in the cease-fire. We are a little bit worried of being trapped. If there is no way out, all we can do is stay and fight here."" Credit: ANDREW E. KRAMER; Michael R.

3034,1869658741.xml,"MUNICH -- Bearing what he said was a message from President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence told anxious European political and security leaders on Saturday that ""the United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in our commitment to this trans-Atlantic alliance.""But while offering that assurance to European partners alarmed by Mr. Trump's rise, along with some tough words on Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Pence also warned that Europe must increase its military spending in a dangerous world, saying, ""As you keep faith with us, under President Trump, we will always keep faith with you.""The NATO treaty demands not only collective defense but a vow to ""contribute our fair share to our common defense,"" Mr. Pence, making his first overseas trip as vice president, said at an annual security conference here.""That pledge has gone unfulfilled for too many for too long and erodes the very foundation of our alliance,"" he said. He echoed an early theme of Mr. Trump, who has said he believes that the United States' allies have taken advantage of American largess and not paid their fair share.""Europe's defense requires your commitment as much as ours,"" Mr. Pence said.NATO allies have promised to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024, but only five countries now meet that figure. Germany, for instance, which has Europe's largest economy, now spends only 1.2 percent of G.D.P. on its military, though it increased spending 8 percent last year.Mr. Pence said that while some NATO members met the spending goal, ""many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a credible path."" Mr. Trump, he said, ""expects allies to meet that goal. For most, that means the time has come to do more.""It is a time of great anxiety in Europe, in no small part because of the rise of Mr. Trump, who has brushed aside long-held tenets of American foreign policy.He has praised Britain's vote to exit the European Union, questioned the viability of that bloc and the relevance of NATO and expressed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, while also upending policies and diplomacy on the Middle East, China and Mexico. Amid these shifting currents, Europeans are seeking signs that the United States remains a steadfast ally.Applause for Mr. Pence's speech was thin. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spoke before the vice president, argued that increases in military spending must be gradual to be efficient and effective.Ms. Merkel said that spending on other matters -- like development aid, education for girls and women, and caring for refugees -- also contributes to mutual security, as do stronger multilateral institutions like the European Union and the United Nations, which Mr. Trump has criticized.Europe needs the support of the United States in the face of Islamist terrorism and Russian ambition, Ms. Merkel said, promising to continue to spend more to meet NATO goals. ""We need the military strength of the United States,"" she said.But she warned against nationalism, without specifically naming Mr. Trump's ""America First"" philosophy. ""Will we be able to continue working well together, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?"" she asked. ""Let's make the world better together, and then it will be better for each of us.""Ms. Merkel is facing a re-election campaign in September in which the extent of increased military spending is already a hot political issue, as is her handling of the influx of refugees into Europe.Mr. Pence's message, similar to one offered by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, appeared to have done little to reassure Europeans who think that making NATO commitments conditional on spending undermines the alliance's credibility and deterrence.""American government officials need to go back to Washington recognizing that there are serious concerns in Europe, especially in Germany, about a host of issues from trade to foreign policy and NATO,"" said Steven E. Sokol, the president of the American Council on Germany.""Even though they gave reassurance, people here will hold them to it, and it will make matters worse if these reassurances just pay lip service to those concerns and make it that much harder to rebuild trust in what is an indispensable partnership,"" he said.Strobe Talbott, the president of the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Mr. Pence had accomplished his main task by conveying the administration's commitment to NATO. ""It had the big reassurance,"" Mr. Talbott said. ""He made clear he was speaking for the president.""Later in the day, John F. Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, told the conference that Mr. Trump, as the White House has indicated, was ""contemplating issuing a tighter, more streamlined version"" of his controversial executive order barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.Mr. Kelly added, ""I will have, this time, the opportunity to work on a rollout plan."" The arrival of the earlier order was marked by confusion and distress, leaving many travelers stranded overseas. This time, he said, he would try to ensure that no one was caught in transit.""If they are in motion from some distant land, when they arrive they will be allowed in,"" he said. He said that would apply to green card and visa holders.But most of the emphasis on Saturday was on Mr. Pence's speech.Thierry de Montbrial, executive chairman of the French Institute of International Relations, said Mr. Pence had done a good job of ""delivering the gospel that people needed of the importance of the trans-Atlantic alliance.""At the same time, Mr. de Montbrial said, ""he said clearly that he wants Europe to be stronger, which in a way is a good change from the past, when Washington was skeptical about a stronger European defense.""A senior White House foreign policy adviser, who was not authorized to discuss the trip and requested anonymity, said that Mr. Pence wanted to send a message of reassurance as well as obligation, both here and in Brussels, where he will meet with European Union and NATO officials on Monday.Part of that message was strong words on Russia, even as Europeans wonder about Mr. Trump's admiration for Mr. Putin.Mr. Pence vowed that the United States would ""hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which, as you know, President Trump believes can be found."" He said the United States would hold Russia to its commitments to reach a permanent cease-fire in Ukraine.In his speech, Mr. Pence spoke of his first trip to Europe, in 1977 at age 18, and the impact a divided Berlin made on him when he crossed from West to East.""The vibrant color of the free world fell away,"" he said. ""In that moment I came face to face with the choice facing the Western world between freedom and tyranny.""Crediting past leaders in the East and West, he added: ""By the grace of God, and through the leadership of Reagan, Thatcher, Kohl, Mitterrand, Havel, Walesa -- the wall fell, Communism collapsed, and freedom prevailed.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

1050,433237285.xml,"      The former prime minister, Ayad Allawi, was attacked by a mob during a campaign visit on Sunday to the Shiite holy city of Najaf, police officials said. He escaped unharmed and later characterized the attack as an assassination attempt. In Baghdad, an official statement said Iraqi intelligence had uncovered a plot by insurgents to fire rockets at the courtroom where Saddam Hussein's trial is scheduled to resume Monday. The statement, quoting Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser, said an insurgent group called the 1920's Revolution Brigades had planned to attack the courthouse for the special tribunal that is trying Mr. Hussein and seven others. The statement gave no further details and did not say whether any arrests had been made. In another development that underscored the difficulties of holding the trial before an Iraqi court, officials of the court said Sunday that one of five judges hearing the case had withdrawn after learning that the court had a document showing that one of the defendants may have played a role in the execution of his brother. The judge, one of four whose names have been kept secret for security reasons, will be replaced by one of two alternate judges who have been standing by, the officials said. The confrontation in Najaf began as Mr. Allawi, a Shiite who heads a secular coalition of Sunni and Shiite leaders, arrived at the gold-domed Imam Ali mosque, said Maj. Muhammad Ali, chief of the government's antiterrorism bureau in Najaf. A crowd hostile to Mr. Allawi gathered outside as he disappeared into the shrine, Major Ali said. As Mr. Allawi left, the mob threw stones, dirt and shoes at his entourage, and his guards fired their assault rifles into the air to disperse the crowd, police officials said. Television images showed Mr. Allawi's entourage sprinting out of the mosque toward waiting cars as bursts of automatic gunfire sounded. American and Iraqi security officials have warned of a surge in violence before the Dec. 15 elections for a full, four-year national Parliament, and political tensions are mounting. On his return to Baghdad, Mr. Allawi told reporters that the situation was worse inside the mosque, the holiest shrine in Shiite Islam. He told Sharqiya, an Arabic-language television station, that as he was praying, he was surrounded by more than 50 men with pistols and knives, one of whom fired his weapon at Mr. Allawi. ''The man who tried to shoot me didn't control the pistol well because he looked scared and because of the good luck, so nobody was hurt,'' he told the television station. But Col. Najah Yassir, commander of the city's emergency security force, which helped protect Mr. Allawi, denied in a telephone interview that anyone had entered the shrine with weapons. Islamic tradition forbids weapons inside mosques, and the Imam Ali mosque is tightly controlled by a special guard force supervised by an arm of the national government. Mr. Allawi's spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Mr. Allawi was prime minister when American troops laid siege to Najaf in August 2004 to wrest control of it from the militia loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, the rebel Shiite cleric. Many of the cleric's followers resent Mr. Allawi for permitting the assault, which inflicted hundreds of casualties among Mr. Sadr's followers and left much of the city in ruins. In his comments to Sharqiya, Mr. Allawi said the gunmen inside the shrine were from a militia, which he did not name, an assertion that pointed toward Mr. Sadr's armed wing, the Mahdi Army. Fahab al-Ameri, a spokesman for Mr. Sadr in Najaf, denied that his organization had any contact with Mr. Allawi's entourage. In eastern Baghdad on Sunday, an American soldier was killed when a bomb exploded near his patrol, the military said in a statement, which offered no further information. In an attack apparently unrelated to the Najaf incident, a follower of Mr. Sadr's, Sheik Abdul Salaam al-Bahadli, 40, was shot dead by unidentified men as he sat in his car in the Zayuna district of eastern Baghdad, said an official at the Interior Ministry. An aide to Mr. Sadr said Mr. Bahadli was an important member of the cleric's office in Sadr City, the poor Baghdad neighborhood from which Mr. Sadr draws tremendous support. The motive for the attack was unclear. The Monday session in the trial of Mr. Hussein will be only the court's third since the trial began nearly seven weeks ago. During an initial adjournment of 40 days to allow the defendants time to choose and confer with lawyers, 2 of 13 defense lawyers who appeared for the first session were assassinated. Problems in assuring that all defendants had counsel of their choice caused the court to adjourn last Monday for a week. The court's plan on Monday is to begin hearing from a group of 10 or 11 witnesses who have been described by American officials as having been drawn from among the survivors of the events at issue in the trial, involving the execution of more than 140 men and teenage boys after an assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein in the Shiite town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, in 1982. After three or four days of proceedings this week, the court plans to adjourn again before the Dec. 15 elections, and to resume in late January, court officials have said. But they acknowledged that further defense maneuvers on Monday could alter the plans. Ramsey Clark, an attorney general under President Johnson in the late 1960's who has been made part of Mr. Hussein's defense team, said in an interview in Baghdad on Sunday that he expected to address the court for the first time on Monday, pressing the judges to find the court itself illegal. ''We will tell the court that as a creation of the American occupation authority, it cannot assure the defendants of a fair trial,'' Mr. Clark said. On Sunday, 11 cultural institutions from around the world issued a joint call for the release of Susanne Osthoff, the German archaeologist and aid worker who was kidnapped with her driver late last month in Iraq. In a videotape they released last Tuesday, Ms. Osthoff's kidnappers threatened to kill her and her driver unless Germany ceased to cooperate with the Iraqi government, a demand rejected by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

2038,2579921826.xml,"Critics claim Russia is manipulating the flow of gas to push up prices, but for Vladimir Putin it's schadenfreude over Western European nations that he sees as unprepared.MOSCOW -- In Europe, the surge in the price of natural gas has halted factories, startled politicians and alarmed consumers fearful of a cold winter.For President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who turned 69 on Thursday, it all added up to something of an early birthday present.The Kremlin has for years bridled at Europe's drive to reduce emissions and to diversify its energy supply, efforts that threatened to undermine a Russian economy heavily reliant on oil and gas exports. This fall, as Mr. Putin sees it, the Europeans finally got their comeuppance: a confluence of events catapulted energy prices to record heights, putting the Russian president in a position to ride to the rescue.""Let's think about a possible increase of the supply on the market, but we must be careful in doing so,"" Mr. Putin told his energy minister Wednesday evening, sending gas prices down sharply in a matter of minutes -- although they remain about seven times higher than a year ago.The televised exchange underlined the dominant position that Mr. Putin, for now, still commands as the leader of a country supplying more than 40 percent of the European Union's natural gas imports. Russia has previously used its role as a critical energy source to pressure individual countries such as Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine. Now, the tensions are about something more existential: the future of Russia's most important economic bond with Europe and of a key geopolitical lever for the Kremlin.""We decided: 'We'll let them freeze a good bit this winter and then they'll become more talkative, and won't insist on quickly abandoning gas,""' said Mikhail I. Krutikhin, an energy analyst at the consultancy RusEnergy. ""The stakes are very high.""That sort of tough talk breeds deep mistrust in Europe, where critics see Russia as deliberately withholding extra natural gas from the market to try to pressure Germany and Brussels to quickly certify Nord Stream 2, the undersea pipeline that will transport huge amounts of gas to Western Europe.The decision by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom not to fill its European storage facilities has contributed to the high prices, according to Trevor Sikorski, head of global gas at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.""The Russians can't just wash their hands and say it has nothing to do with them,"" Mr. Sikorski said. ""It obviously has a lot to do with them.""The European Commission is looking into the claim that Russia is manipulating the flow of gas to push up prices but has reached no conclusion. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose government has backed Nord Stream 2 and called it a business deal, not a geopolitical strategy, dismissed charges that Russia is partly to blame for the rise in European gas prices.""To my knowledge, there are no orders where Russia has said we won't deliver it to you,"" Ms. Merkel told reporters on Wednesday. ""Russia can only deliver gas on the basis of contractual obligations.""Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said in an interview on Thursday in Brussels that Russia had a history of using energy ""as a political weapon,"" but added, ""Whether that's what's happening here now is something I'll leave to others.""But he said that the United States had ""a real concern"" that energy supply was not keeping up with recovering demand. He said he had discussed the issue on Thursday with E.U. officials and that the United States would ""like to be aligned with Europe"" in securing more supplies.  The U.S. has opposed Nord Stream 2 on the grounds that it would increase European dependence on Russian gas, but in August it dropped its threat to block the pipeline.""We have a fundamental interest in seeing global energy supplies, in both gas and oil, at sufficient levels to support global economic recovery and not stall it out,"" Mr. Sullivan said. ""We'd like to see energy suppliers take measures to ensure that that is the case.""Russia has been fulfilling its contractual obligations to European clients, analysts and officials say, but has resisted delivering significantly more even as demand increasingly outpaced supply. That has exacerbated an energy crisis fueled by a variety of factors, including the increase in demand as the world comes out of the pandemic, a cold end to last winter that left storage tanks low, higher demand from China and low wind speeds in Europe that reduced renewable energy production.The Kremlin, as has often been the case in Mr. Putin's approach to geopolitics, seized on the situation to gain a tactical advantage. The high demand presented Russia with an opportunity to bolster Moscow's insistence that European customers sign long-term contracts with Gazprom, rather than making short-term purchases on exchanges. And it was a chance to push the E.U. to issue final approvals for Nord Stream 2.Gazprom's defenders point out that the company is not required to deliver gas beyond what it pledged in its contracts and that European officials have themselves to blame if they failed to plan properly.""Do we have an obligation to deliver additional new volumes of gas? No we don't,"" Sergei Pikin, a Russian energy analyst, said. ""Where should Europeans be getting new volumes of gas from? Nord Stream 2.""Aleksandr Novak, a deputy prime minister, made the link to the gas pipeline explicit in his televised video conference with Mr. Putin on Wednesday. Certification and approval of Nord Stream 2 by the E.U. ""as fast as possible"" would give ""a positive signal"" that could ""cool down the current situation,"" Mr. Novak told the president.With Nord Stream 2 operating, Russia's hold on Europe's energy market would tighten even further -- giving Mr. Putin more opportunities to influence European politics. And it would reduce Russia's reliance on Ukraine as a transit country for gas exports to Western Europe, potentially weakening a regional foe.Mr. Putin insisted that Russia was not at fault for Europe's predicament. But he did not shy away from one of his favorite modes of criticism -- schadenfreude.""What we see now is the result of their persistent actions, frankly speaking -- careless at the least and with dire consequences for the market,"" Mr. Putin said, referring to European officials. ""Talking to these so-called experts was always rather difficult, because they do it with a well-known portion of snobbery, their view is always right, and they never wanted to hear anything else. I hope we'll see some corrections now.""It was an echo of a common line of late on Russian state television -- that Europe was falsely blaming Russia for a litany of sins even as it pleaded with Moscow to sell more gas.""They're afraid of freezing and demanding that Russia warm Europe up immediately,"" a state television host, Dmitri Kiselyov, quipped on his prime-time show in September.On Thursday, the price of natural gas futures continued to fall as traders anticipated that Russia would open the spigot. A senior Gazprom official warned that price volatility in Europe was ""destabilizing"" and said the company was supplying gas on top of contracted agreements ""where we have such a technical possibility.""""We genuinely feel for all countries"" experiencing energy price shocks, the Gazprom official, Elena Burmistrova, said at a conference in St. Petersburg, according to Russia's Tass news agency. ""This is a colossal shock to the economy of any country.""Anton Troianovski reported from Moscow, Steven Erlanger from Brussels, and Stanley Reed from London.

2921,1552191745.xml,"       DONETSK, Ukraine --  The warnings from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the White House over the past week could not have been graver in tone: The Russian Army, they said, had massed enough forces on the border with Ukraine to invade. The last time Russian troops appeared to menace Ukraine, in the spring, the Ukrainian military quickly halted attacks on pro-Russian separatists to avoid the chance of touching off a new war in Europe. Not this time. Buoyed by successes against the separatists over the past two months -- and noting that the Russians have threatened an invasion in the region before without following through -- Ukrainian commanders have pressed ahead with an offensive to drive the rebels from their stronghold in Donetsk in the east. The army continued to fire artillery into the city nightly, and paramilitary groups raided outlying villages despite warnings from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that he could intervene at any time to protect Ukrainians who favor closer ties with his country. And the Ukrainians have flaunted their victories. When pro-Ukrainian militiamen reclaimed the village of Marinka from pro-Russian forces, they captured the action with a GoPro camera mounted on a fighter's shoulder. The video showed them marching into the village, yelling and waving their rifles in the air, firing wildly. Despite growing jitters in the West, Ukraine's military leaders say they are making a well-calculated gamble, betting that Mr. Putin feels he has too much to lose to invade, including the possibility of crippling international sanctions. So while Western officials view each new Ukrainian artillery barrage in Donetsk as drawing the country closer to the brink, the Ukrainians see their unchecked advance as further confirmation that Mr. Putin is mobilizing troops only as a scare tactic to keep them from reclaiming territory. The government in Kiev is ""calling Putin's bluff,"" said Oleh Voloshyn, a former Ukrainian diplomat, who said political leaders dismissed Mr. Putin's moves as ""psychological pressure.""  ""If we pause, it would show Putin that any time he puts troops on the border, we will stop,"" Mr. Voloshyn said.  Ukraine was given just that option on Saturday when a separatist leader, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, offered what appeared to be an unconditional cease-fire to prevent a large-scale ""humanitarian catastrophe."" On Saturday night, a senior adviser to Ukraine's minister of the interior said Ukraine would not halt its offensive. As Ukraine continued its all-out assault, the international maneuvering over Ukraine's fate continued.  Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, spoke by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and called for ""urgent measures to prevent an impending humanitarian catastrophe."" The statement seemed to increase worries in the West that Russia might use the Ukrainian offensive as a convenient reason to send in troops -- which it says are on exercises near the border -- as a peacekeeping mission or to deliver humanitarian aid to areas under siege. Mr. Kerry cautioned Russia against intervening on the ""pretext"" of providing aid. Statements issued by the White House said that President Obama had spoken with both Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and that all had agreed that any Russian intervention, ""even under purported 'humanitarian' auspices,"" without Ukrainian government agreement would violate international law. Russia's testiness over Ukraine's boasts of increasing successes was clear on Saturday. A senior aide to President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said that diplomatic consultations overnight Friday with unspecified foreign officials had halted a Russian military column approaching the border.  A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, shot back, saying ""Kiev is more and more inventive in creating fairy tales,"" according to Reuters.  If the Ukrainians' calculations about Mr. Putin's willingness to engage directly are wrong, Mr. Obama and other Western leaders will face yet another crisis at a time of mounting danger in Iraq and as hostilities between Israel and Hamas continue. So far, despite growing anxiety, the West seems loath to try to stop the Ukrainians, particularly after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, for which the United States blames the separatists.  There are plenty of reasons for Mr. Putin to be wary about committing troops to a war. The separatist zones of eastern Ukraine that were well defined just several months ago are now amorphous, with the front lines shifting after the Ukrainian military retook 75 percent of the territory initially seized by pro-Russian rebels.  Beyond that, loyalties in eastern Ukraine are split, increasing the risk that the portion of the population that supports Kiev would aid any insurgency against Russia should it invade. An invasion would also be costly, not only because of the likelihood of stiffened sanctions, but because it could plunge the region into an economic free-fall, bleeding funds from whichever country wins on the battlefield. But Western leaders and analysts remain unconvinced Mr. Putin will be willing to be taunted endlessly or to permit extensive deaths of pro-Russian civilians. The United Nations said recently that at least 1,543 civilians and combatants on both sides have died since mid-April. ""The Russian president has a record of brash, emotional and forceful behavior, and he could just 'go for it,' "" Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group, a risk analysis organization, wrote last week in an analysis published by the group. The Eurasia Group estimated the likelihood of a Russian invasion at about 35 percent. Some of the only backers of the notion that Mr. Putin will surely not invade appear to be the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine who crave his help. Yuri, a commander of about 500 pro-Russian fighters defending Donetsk, said he does not believe the Russians will cross the border. ""Russia,"" he said, ""is afraid of starting World War III."" For the moment, it is clear the Ukrainians are emboldened. A spokesman for the Ukrainian military operation in the east, Col. Aleksei Dmitrashkivsky, said morale is high. ""The threats to send Russian peacekeepers into Ukraine have been around since April, but nothing happens,"" he said. ""The Ukrainian Army is learning quickly how to fight. Volunteers who join the army want to defend this land. We are not afraid."" The Ukrainian military strategy, commanders say, centers on encircling Donetsk to squeeze off the lifeline of supplies from the other separatist stronghold, the city of Luhansk, and from the Russian border. On Saturday, a rebel website, citing the separatist military commander Igor Strelkov, said the Ukrainian Army had cut off resupply routes. The fighting for Donetsk has taken on a lethal pattern: The regular army bombards separatist positions from afar, followed by chaotic, violent assaults by some of the half-dozen or so paramilitary groups surrounding Donetsk who are willing to plunge into urban combat.  Officials in Kiev say the militias and the army coordinate their actions, but the militias, which count about 7,000 fighters, are angry and, at times, uncontrollable. One known as Azov, which took over the village of Marinka, flies a neo-Nazi symbol resembling a Swastika as its flag. In pressing their advance, the fighters took their orders from a local army commander, rather than from Kiev. In the video of the attack, no restraint was evident. Gesturing toward a suspected pro-Russian position, one soldier screamed, ""The bastards are right there!"" Then he opened fire. Credit: ANDREW E. KRAMER; Michael R.

3020,2168034628.xml,"BRUSSELS -- Some of the smugness here is gone.The European Union took a tough line in negotiating its divorce with Britain, wishing to preserve its unity and discourage other countries from wanting to leave the bloc. But now officials worry that what they have achieved may be ""a catastrophic success.""British politics is in meltdown after Parliament's crushing defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May's carefully negotiated plan for Brexit, as the process of withdrawal is known. And no other compelling alternative plan for an orderly exit is in sight, with just 10 weeks to go until Britain is set to exit the bloc.European Union officials are now worried that Britain could leave without any agreement -- a so-called ""hard exit"" that analysts warn could trigger a recession in Britain, causing huge backlogs, delays and shortages of goods, and badly hit the European economy, too, since more than 40 percent of Britain's trade is with the bloc.Yet they see no point in making any concessions now, since Mrs. May has lost control of the process.""Catastrophic success is accurate, in that the general meltdown of the British political system highlights to everyone what a bad idea it is to leave the European Union,"" said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy's Institute of International Relations. ""That is success, but catastrophic because at this point there's no obvious way out of this.""Some in Britain are urging a delay in its scheduled March 29 departure, to allow time for a new consensus, a leadership change or even a second referendum. But even a delay, which the bloc would probably grant if a deal seemed imminent, has its own complications.Postponing Britain's departure, while avoiding chaos, ""could still have bad and even catastrophic consequences for the E.U., given the delays involved and the imminence of the European elections,"" Ms. Tocci said.Those elections for a new European Parliament, set to begin May 23, are considered a crucial test of populist and euroskeptic sentiment on the Continent.An extended Brexit debate and the subsequent uncertainty ""would be spun in different national contexts, creating risks and unpredictability that most incumbent governments don't want to raise,"" Ms. Tocci said.But European leaders seem united in rejecting any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, or divorce deal, which they believe already goes a long way toward meeting British demands.For now, the Europeans will wait to see what emerges from Britain's lawmakers. At the same time, they are preparing for a ""no-deal"" exit and consider March 29 to be a pressure-cooker deadline for Britain.""Nobody wishes to end up with a complete breakdown, which would be bad for both sides, even if worse for the U.K.,"" said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""But the other E.U. states are reasonably confident Britain won't do that, since there is no parliamentary majority for a no-deal.""Once a divorce deal is finally done, Britain's future relationship with the bloc can be negotiated in many ways, European officials consistently say. But most of the likely options would require retaining the primary sticking point in Britain: the guarantee that no hard border will be created on the island of Ireland.President Emmanuel Macron of France has been particularly tough on the issue, partly because France sees a larger role for itself once Britain leaves.But now that he is so unpopular at home and challenged by the anti-Europe ""yellow vest"" protesters, ""the more macabre and gruesome the British situation is, the better given his domestic situation,"" Mr. Leonard said.France will not accept any dilution of the single market, said Christian Lequesne, a professor of political science at Sciences Po in Paris. In regard to the European Parliament, France also wants to avoid ""an ongoing negotiation with a new Parliament without Britons, while the British are not officially out of the E.U.,"" he said, adding, ""That's just too complicated.""Even Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has been eager to keep close ties with Britain, has said that ""it is clear that there cannot be any renegotiations"" of the current deal, although she is open in principle to extending the deadline for departure.From the perspective of the European Union, the whole exercise has been something of a nightmare, said Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the European Policy Center, an independent think tank in Brussels.""The E.U. would say it made a number of concessions to the U.K. but preserved its principles, making the best deal possible given British red lines,"" he said.The bloc deals only with governments, not with parliaments or the public, and the European Union was eager to help Mrs. May get her deal through.""But if it now looks like that is not in her power, no matter what the E.U. puts on the table, the inclination is not to put anything more out there,"" Mr. Zuleeg said. ""And some still feel that the closer the U.K. gets to a no-deal, the more likely it is that they will compromise.""There is little regret among European officials about their role in the talks. As Mr. Leonard said, the European Union's primary goal from the start has been to preserve the single market, get money from Britain, preserve the rights of European Union citizens, make sure that Ireland was protected and make leaving look unattractive to other countries.The member states held together, Mr. Leonard said, adding, ""Brussels never sold out Ireland, as much as the U.K. may have wished it to.""Some analysts found fault with both sides.""The negotiations have been in a certain way a failure, more diplomatically than politically,"" said Luuk van Middelaar, a Dutch philosopher and former aide to the first president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.Being an institution of laws and regulations, the European Union paid too little attention to the strategic and geopolitical importance of Britain to Europe, he said, focusing on trade first, where Brussels held the cards, and security later.The British, with their attitude of having their cake and eating it, paid too little attention to the ""unavoidable trade-offs between taking back control and economic loss,"" Mr. van Middelaar said. But Brussels also suffered from hubris. ""We thought too soon that we rode a faultless track,"" he said. ""There was pride about the unity shown.""Brussels, Mr. van Middelaar added, ""paid too much attention to the logic of the divorce, and too little attention went to the bigger strategic dimension of Brexit and the geopolitical aspects, which are a loss -- an amputation.""Michel Barnier, the chief European negotiator, defended the withdrawal agreement as ""the best possible compromise,"" and said Brussels should be patient with the workings of British democracy.At the same time, he urged faster efforts to prepare for a no-deal exit, as France did on Friday, ordering the implementation of its no-deal contingency plan.Frans Timmermans, the optimistic first vice president of the European Commission, said that Brexit would damage everyone, and that ""it is our collective responsibility to limit that harm as much as possible.""He cited the Rolling Stones: ""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might get what you need.""If only it were clearer to Brussels what Britain wanted, let alone needed.Credit: STEVEN ERLANGER; Milan Schreuer contributed reporting.Clockwise from top: A pro-Brexit demonstrator outside the British Parliament this week; Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator; and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who is seen as benefiting politically from Britain's struggles.

1999,2182027990.xml,"MUNICH -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany delivered a strong rejoinder on Saturday to American demands that European allies pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and gave a spirited defense of multilateral institutions in a world increasingly marked by great-power rivalry.In an uncharacteristically passionate speech, Ms. Merkel said the nuclear deal was the best way of influencing Iranian behavior on a range of non-nuclear issues, from missile development to terrorism.Without mentioning President Trump or the United States by name in what may be her last speech to this major security conference, Ms. Merkel criticized other unilateral moves, such as Mr. Trump's decision to pull American troops out of Syria, a suggestion that he would withdraw quickly from Afghanistan and his decision to suspend the Intermediate Range Missile Treaty with Russia, which directly affects European security.""We sit there in the middle with the result,"" she said.Ms. Merkel spoke immediately before the United States vice president, Mike Pence, and addressed a packed auditorium with an audience that included Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka, as well as the Russian foreign minister and a high-ranking Chinese official, who all pointedly remained seated when the chancellor received a standing ovation.Her reception was in sharp contrast to the polite near-silence that greeted Mr. Pence's address. Aware of a growing anxiety among European allies that the United States administration's erratic leadership stance was a threat to their security, the vice president came to Munich laser-focused on the Trump administration's message.He repeated his demand from this past week in Warsaw that Germany, France and Britain should join Washington in pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.""The time has come for the Europeans to leave the Iranian nuclear deal,"" Mr. Pence said.In contrast to the chancellor, Mr. Pence focused less on working together and more on a list of demands for American allies based on American interests, with a heavy emphasis on a combative approach to Iran.""The Iranian regime openly advocates another Holocaust, and it seeks the means to achieve it,"" Mr. Pence said.The two speeches were a reminder of how far apart Europe and the United States are on a range of global issues.Ms. Merkel said the split over Iran ""depresses me very much,"" but she stressed that Europe and America were ultimately pursuing the same goal since Europe, too, was concerned about Iranian behavior.""I see the ballistic missile program, I see Iran in Yemen, and above all I see Iran in Syria,"" Ms. Merkel said.She added: ""The only question that stands between us on this issue is, do we help our common cause, our common aim of containing the damaging or difficult development of Iran, by withdrawing from the one remaining agreement? Or do we help it more by keeping the small anchor we have in order maybe to exert pressure in other areas?""Ms. Merkel defended multilateralism and stressed that collective solutions were the only way to tackle global challenges -- from a rising China to climate change to mutually beneficial trade.The chancellor also challenged the United States on its decision to pull put of Syria, asking, ""Is that not also strengthening the possibilities for Iran and Russia to exert influence there?""One main issue of disagreement between Berlin and Washington -- as well as Poland and the Baltic States -- is the Nordstream 2 pipeline that would send Russian gas to Germany while bypassing Ukraine.Mr. Pence accused Germany again of putting its own interests ahead of its neighbors' and of giving Russia a possible tool to pressure the West.""We can't ensure the defense of the West if our allies are dependent on the East,"" he said.In her speech, Ms. Merkel said that Europe was buying Russian gas anyway, even if it arrived through a Ukrainian pipeline. Even during the Cold War, she said, ""we imported large amounts of Russian gas. I don't know why times should be so much worse today.""""Do we want to make Russia only dependent on China? Is that our European interest?"" she asked. ""I don't think so.""Mr. Pence, for his part, said that the United States was committed to NATO, and he praised Mr. Trump for pushing allies to spend more on defense, for standing up to China and North Korea and for showing renewed American leadership in the world.After both leaders had spoken, many observers came away struck by the difference in tone and reception.""In contrast to Merkel's visionary outward-looking speech that triggered warm applause, Mr. Pence delivered a stilted defense of Trump's achievements to a skeptical audience,"" said Amanda Sloat, a scholar with the Brookings Institution in Washington and a former official in the Obama administration.Ms. Merkel even mocked the idea that German cars could be considered a ""national security threat"" by the United States, as American trade officials have asserted.""If that is viewed as a security threat by the United States,"" she said, ""we are shocked.""Declaring that BMW's largest plant was now not in Bavaria but in South Carolina, she added, ""We are proud of our cars, and so we should be.""This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.Credit: KATRIN BENNHOLD and STEVEN ERLANGER; Katie Rogers contributed reporting.",2019-02-17
1169,1727656219.xml,"       Among the redwoods of Santa Cruz, RACHEL KUSHNER and the American novelist ricochet through reading as a religious experience, the cultural evolution of East Germany and the nightmare of total transparency. DO YOU WANT to see the redwoods?"" he asked both me and the photographer, but added, I thought, addressing me, ""You are probably familiar, being from Northern California."" And I said to him that we had one in the backyard of my parents' house in San Francisco, although, I thought later, it wasn't a tree you could drive a car through, exactly. To be fair, I had mentioned wanting to see trees on a different visit to Jonathan Franzen, coincidentally just prior to this journalistic visit, or whatever it was. The other had been a social call. I was in the area, and had said that I'd like to see some trees, lamenting that down where I live, in Southern California, they were dying by the millions on account of the drought. On that trip, I came from due east, and had been reading his latest novel, ""Purity."" I thought it would be right to arrive as his guest in Santa Cruz ready to present my reactions to the book, which is filled with great comedy. (For the record, I would consider Jon principally a comic writer.) But as I traveled west, I regretted that despite having consumed the book quickly, eagerly, in a motel room in Chowchilla (a town that features a large women's prison, where I was visiting people), I had not managed to read the last eight pages. I was not going to park somewhere and read them in the car before arriving, because that would seem unnatural, to finish a book in a car. For what reason, I asked myself, to rush through instead of savor, in order to say to him I'd read it? No, I'd thought, I'll finish it on his porch, which was what I did, and closed the book happy to see the little brown towhees that figure in the séance and texture of the novel's ending, which I later called light and he called dark. The next week, after that visit, came this curious assignment, to write about Jon, who is not a close friend, but a friend, which is what makes it curious. He's someone I'd first met 18 years ago and had liked right away, a person whose considerable charisma happens up close, as presence. I've always felt some kind of warmth toward him, or from him, separate from my admiration for him as a writer. He likes women from California, at least that is what he always says, and he is someone I could telephone in consternation, in need of advice, and have done so. But he would not want to hear from me every day, and this has also strengthened a mutual trust, both of us being people who want brief social engagements and then to return to nurturing a productive alienation or joy and either way conduct life with a limited amount of interaction, at least with other writers. But we had submitted to do this thing together, and then could not agree on where to meet. I wanted Jon to see the filmmaker James Benning's cabins, one a replica of Thoreau's, the other of Ted Kaczynski's, and to perhaps discuss solitude, American transcendentalism and eco-activism, and be in a beautiful but lesser known part of California, the central-southern Sierras. Jon rejected that. A friend jeeringly said to me, ""Why don't you go birding with him?"" Which was the very thing Jon suggested, that we go to the Channel Islands in pursuit of the rare island scrub jay, which, I thought, as soon as he suggested it, would never work, because the boats that go there are vomitoriums and the island where this jay lives offers scant shade, and I hate the sun. After that exchange, I thought it would be O.K. to just go ahead and admit something to myself, an opposition: that he, Jon, loves birds, and I love people and come down on their side if we are choosing teams. I could even form a kind of repulsion toward the rare island scrub jay, when I imagined being trapped on a boat in the boiling ocean, in search of the squawking creature that, like every other scrub jay, eats canned sardines. In the end, I simply returned to him in Santa Cruz, with a quick jaunt, first, to a beautiful little town in the San Lorenzo Valley where Jon and his girlfriend, Kathy, used to live, a place with a main-street bar and hardware store, and just off the main street, a swimming hole. Then Jon and the photographer went off to shoot the portrait among some redwood trees in a state park, after which Jon and I sat down to talk at a picnic table over a ravine, where we remained until a plague of mosquitoes and then one human, a Franzen fan, all alighted on Jon and it was time to escape to a restaurant in Santa Cruz, where the fog, which Jon describes with felicity and precision in ""Purity,"" had rolled in and made us cold. JON WAS THE PERSON who told me to read ""Angels"" by Denis Johnson, which I still consider a very fine American novel. He once said to me that strawberries are an unnecessary apology for rhubarb, and recommended to me, aptly, the Wim Wenders film ""The American Friend."" I met only on one occasion his very famous American friend, the one who killed himself at the age of 46, and that famous friend had said to me that he, meaning Jon, seemed so serious and stern but then it turns out he is the nicest person in the world. Which I had suddenly remembered, and relayed to Jon, back when I had learned that his friend died. The first thing I asked Jon about was Oakland, as Pip, a character in ""Purity"" (her full name), lives there, in a house that's something like a squat, where one character reads Gramsci and is connected to the Catholic Worker. Jon himself had spent time hanging out at a Catholic Worker house in Philadelphia, in the mid-'90s. He found their objectives appealing, he said, and even went to Catholic Church. Although it was, he told me, ""partly a matter of a girl."" About Catholicism, Jon said, ""If you really take Flannery O'Connor seriously, as I did at that time, you get interested. That was probably the peak of my involvement with Dostoyevsky, and with both of those writers it's not art and it's not religion, it's religious art, although Dostoyevsky is so multivalent that it's more complicated."" We moved on to a discussion of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, and Jon spoke of their relation as a competition. ""You had two talents of that order working at the same time,"" he said, ""and in the same way that siblings specialize, they each became more intensely the thing they'd been to begin with - as a way of competing, and a way of saying, 'I'm not that other sibling, I'm me.'"" And I said, ""but in order to occupy what they nonetheless misperceive as the one spot."" To be fair, I know little of Tolstoy's biography, only that he was a pacifist and revolutionary, had a late-life religious conversion and died in a train station. I mentioned these things and Jon said that what happened to Tolstoy - his conversion, his strange behavior later in life - could have been merely ""TIAs."" I asked what that was or those were, and he said, ""Transient ischemic attacks, you know, mini-strokes. The brain isn't getting enough oxygen and you get weird."" And I said, ""Reduce it all to the brain! What a positivist response!"" And Jon replied, ""Well, he was very old."" Later we spoke of East Germany, which figures prominently in ""Purity,"" and, who knows, might even be having some kind of revival - great athletes, milk banks for women who can't breast-feed, lifetime employment, clunky retro aesthetics. Jon, I thought, is onto something. He's going to have sparked a honeymoon for East Germany. An Italian friend, a Marxist who had vacationed in the G.D.R. as a teenager, had just been waxing eloquent to me about the Trabant, that beloved jewel of East German automotive engineering, and about the women of the German Democratic Republic, whom he had found ""simple"" and ""natural,"" and this friend had said ""simple"" and ""natural"" like you'd describe fresh ingredients. The Republic of Bad Taste is how the G.D.R. is cleverly referred to in a section title of ""Purity."" ""There was just such dowdiness,"" Jon said to me. Spiessig, he said, was the German word for it. If there were a magazine about G.D.R. lovelies, I thought, it could be called Spiessig. But really Jon had already covered that territory in ""Purity"" and more reflexively: In one of my favorite scenes, the East German character's good-looking mother reclines on a couch drinking white wine, aware that she looks like an advertisement for life in the G.D.R. For the record, Angela Merkel would not be included in my fictional magazine Spiessig. Among other big names from the G.D.R., we discussed Christa Wolf, who was anti-unification - a position, we agreed, that was not insane to take. Jon said that she later wrote a book about having been an unofficial collaborator. ""Until the advent of the Internet,"" Jon said, ""the G.D.R. was the most perfectly surveilled society in the history of the world."" Which presented a natural transition to Andreas, an East German in ""Purity"" who becomes an Assange-like leaker, except that while Assange seems to focus mostly on the secrecy of governments, Andreas believes in exposure as some kind of generalized goodness, and what he leaks is kept somewhat vague. At a late point in the narrative, Andreas compares the Internet to the Stasi itself, although it seems he feels its encroachment because he has a damning personal secret to protect. Assange, I said to Jon, had also made this comparison of the Stasi and the Internet, and Jon said, ""Good for him."" But for Assange, I said, I believe it's about Google's relation to the N.S.A. While for Jon, and Andreas, the nature of the Internet itself is totalitarian in its sheer ubiquity. ""I think the dream of radical transparency is a nightmare,"" Jon said. ""People saying how wonderful technology is and that crime will disappear because everything will be known about everyone."" I pictured ISIS beheadings, which are certainly related to a skillful use of social media, or that's what everyone says, and I asked, but do people really talk that way? And he said, ""Yes, just go to TED talks,"" and I said I'd never watched a TED talk. The mere name, I thought, sounds so idiotic. A TED talk. Then we were on to the subject of Edward Snowden, and Jon said he could understand both Snowden's youthful idealism and Obama's contention that the invasions of privacy are not grievous and are in the interest of fighting terrorism. ""Obama's position is that it's just metadata and a rather small amount of metadata,"" Jon said, ""and that intelligent, patriotic people have talked it over and there are safeguards in place. I can see both sides."" I said that my understanding was that the spying by the N.S.A. was both illegal and unconstitutional. Jon said Snowden and Chelsea Manning were heroes in Silicon Valley and that Silicon Valley was suspicious of the government and saw it as the enemy. But this opposition, Silicon Valley versus the government, seemed to obfuscate things for me, as if the example of Judith Miller, to cite only a single emblematic name, did not itself argue emphatically for leakers and data dumps. Could it be possible, I wondered, that the Iraq War might not have happened if a Snowden, an Assange, had arrived on the scene just a few years earlier? But Jon and I didn't take this path. We moved on to other things, namely the commodification of personal data by the tech giants. ""Capitalism,"" Jon said, ""hadn't invaded every pore of your existence until the Internet."" He said that privacy invasions and data gathering far outstrip what the government is doing in that regard. ""My character Andreas says that people should be more afraid of what Google can do to you than what the government can do to you."" But were the tech companies, I wondered, isolated entities or part of something much larger, the character of so-called neoliberalism? Jon, after all, had cited Evgeny Morozov, who has said that ""no plausible story can emerge unless Silicon Valley itself is situated within some broader historical narrative - of changes in production and consumption, changes in state forms, changes in the surveillance capabilities and needs of the U.S. military."" Which to me seems exactly right (I read it after our discussion), and what I tried to say in my own less eloquent way, but Jon was tired and our night was coming to a close. I'll take it up with him another time, I thought. THE NEXT MORNING, as I drank coffee and ate toast in Jon and Kathy's kitchen, we discussed Faust and Mephisto, who connect to ""Purity"" by way of its epigraph. Jon had said, the night before, when I asked him why Mephisto wants Faust's soul, ""Because that is his nature."" I had thought immediately of Wagner, and how such a thing works in Wagner, but I wondered how and if it works in fiction, to have a single fixated desire as a nature, or even to have a fixed nature. I mentioned ""East of Eden"" by Steinbeck, a book Jon loves, which features a character with a fixed and indivisible nature - a child who is born evil, a bad seed. Jon was quiet, and when he spoke, he told me that his cousin had been recently murdered. ""My Aunt Margo used to call him a bad seed,"" he said. ""He was an alcoholic, and he was murdered by his best friend after they had spent a day and a half drinking together. You can investigate the psychology of it, but basically my aunt was right: He was a bad seed."" But then he went on to investigate not the psychology of bad seeds as types, but the psychology of his cousin, who was not a type, but an individual. ""He and his friend were in a bar, and then they finally ran out of money, so they went home and continued drinking there, and apparently the friend got it in his head,"" Jon said, ""that my cousin was interested in the friend's daughter, and that led to violence."" The details, Jon said, were horrifying. When his cousin was still conscious he was asked whether he wanted to be taken to the hospital, and the cousin said, ""No, he's my best friend. I don't want to get him in trouble."" ""But that's kind of beautiful,"" I said. And Jon agreed that it was beautiful. He said his cousin probably thought, I'll just lie here and suffer, and hopefully I'll feel better in the morning. ""So if he'd gone to the hospital,"" I said, ""he might have lived."" Jon said he probably would have. But loyalty, he said, was how this cousin made sense of his difficult life. ""I'm a loyal person,"" Jon said, adopting the subject position of this cousin, or at least his line of reasoning. ""I may be a ne'er do well in all these other ways, but I'm not going to rat out my friend."" The way Jon described his cousin's death, I thought, was a perfect illustration of why there is no such thing as a fixed and unshaded nature. It was also a demonstration of Jon's singular talent to form story, striking narrative, out of life, and tragedy, and in this case honor the real person who was the tragedy's subject, and victim. Honor, but not sugarcoat. He'd called the cousin bad. But then, almost despite his initial instinct, he had allowed for the cousin's life to be truly a loss, and depicted to me the cousin's final moment as a kind of sudden heroism. Whether or not he had intended to treat this cousin with love, to allow him such complexity, it was in Jon's own unique nature to do so. I met Jon's very famous friend, the one who killed himself at the age of 46, and that famous friend had said to me that Jon seems so serious and stern but then it turns out he is the nicest person in the world. Jon and I are both people who want brief social engagements and then to return to nurturing a productive alienation or joy and either way conduct life with a limited amount of interaction, at least with other writers.

2566,1634670339.xml,"       BERLIN -- Displaying a popularity unmatched by other Western political leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was re-elected on Tuesday as chairwoman of the center-right Christian Democratic Union with a thumping 96.7 percent of the votes cast at a national party congress. Ms. Merkel, who is 60 and entering her 10th year in power, had no opponent in the race, so the question put to the party delegates was simply yes or no. She won 884 yes votes; 30 delegates voted no, and 5 abstained. The result was a slight retreat from the last party election in 2012, when 97.9 percent of delegates voted yes. She has now won the party leadership eight times in succession. Rallying the party faithful with the low-key rhetoric that is her trademark, Ms. Merkel put economic priorities ahead of foreign policy in a speech to the congress. Tacitly addressing critics who say she is an excellent tactician but a poor strategist, she stressed a need for boldness in facing the challenges of today. ""Let's be the ones with courage in these tense times,"" Ms. Merkel said. Among the guests listening to her speech at the congress was the Ukrainian boxer Vitali Klitschko, who, as a result of the upheaval in his homeland this year, is now the mayor of Kiev.

BRUSSELS — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has long defended her decision to go ahead with an $11 billion Russian gas pipeline, sticking to her position that politics and business should remain separate.
But that approach came under intense pressure Thursday, with a Russian dissident in a German hospital, poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent that is held closely by the Russian military. Even some members of her own party insisted that the chancellor should respond by canceling the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
The 764-mile pair of pipelines under the Baltic Sea is being built by a consortium led by the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which owns it, and would double the capacity for natural gas to flow directly from Russia to Germany. It has been criticized by many in Europe and the United States for increasing Russian leverage on Germany and helping to line the pockets of the Russian state.
But the pipeline is 94% completed, and Merkel defended the need to finish it as recently as last Friday. At that point, Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was already in Berlin for treatment of a poisoning in Russia, although the use of the nerve agent, Novichok, had not yet been publicly confirmed.
But with the identification of Novichok as the poison, the debate on the pipeline has now been reopened.
For a long time, Merkel has advocated trade and diplomatic engagement with both Russia and China despite their internal repressions and external aggressiveness. Her argument has been that Russia is too close to Europe, and China too economically powerful, to isolate either of them, and that trade provides leverage on them that sanctions do not.
It is getting harder for her to have it both ways. German foreign policy has been notably more assertive to Russia after the country seized Crimea and shot down a Malaysian airliner, and to China after its increasing boldness and repression at home and abroad under its leader, Xi Jinping.
And so Nord Stream 2, originally promoted by her coalition partners, the Social Democrats, is becoming harder to defend, given that its owner, Gazprom, is controlled by the Kremlin of President Vladimir Putin. More Germans are asking how she — and many other European leaders — can portray Russia as a rogue nation in one breath and a legitimate commercial partner in the next?
On Thursday, Norbert Röttgen, a senior member of the chancellor’s conservative party and the head of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament, who has long been critical of Nord Stream 2, called for Germany to respond to the poisoning with tough measures that could include the pipeline and Russia’s sales of natural gas.
“The only language that Putin understands is tough language,” Röttgen said. “We need to respond with the only language that Putin understands, the language of natural gas and selling natural gas.”
To leave Nord Stream 2 out of the question now, he said, “would be the ultimate and maximum confirmation for Vladimir Putin to continue with exactly these kind of policies, because it has been proven once again that there will be no response from Europe.”
The Trump administration and many in Congress have tried to stop the pipeline through the use of secondary sanctions that target companies working to lay the pipeline and would deny them access to the American market and banking system. Merkel and the European Union have decried their use, saying they are illegitimate and should be used against adversaries, not allies.
While Merkel may have been unwilling to bend to U.S. pressure, however, the poisoning of Navalny may “now give her another reason to do so,” noted Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “She could blame it on the Russians, not on the Americans.”
Merkel is not alone in defending the project. Others in her party supported her stance, citing its usefulness for maintaining leverage on Moscow, which needs the income.
“We need to have a joint European response, and we need to have a lever that ensures a robust response, and that has to involve the economy,” said Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives in Parliament.
Hardt said he expected Merkel to work with the European Union and NATO to find important collective responses to the poisoning that involve “effective sanctions, but without driving the Russian economy to the brink.” But he did not believe she would cancel Nord Stream 2.
“If there is one thing we can say about the chancellor, it is that she is not one to bow to pressure,” Hardt said.
Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations and a Russia expert, also doubted that Merkel would block Nord Stream 2 at this late date. Other well-known Russian dissidents have been openly murdered on Russian soil — Boris Nemtsov, for example, was gunned down near the Kremlin in 2015 — and there was far less clamor for a response, he noted.
And other issues matter more, Gomart said, like Belarus, Ukraine, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and the squabbling in the eastern Mediterranean. “This is a situation where Paris and to some extent Berlin do not want to spoil too many of their strategic resources in dealing with Russia when there are so many hot spots,” he said.
“There is a big media focus on Navalny, and of course it’s important and horrible,” he added, “but we can’t waste our resources on things we can’t do anything about.”
President Emmanuel Macron of France’s own recent efforts to re-engage with Russia, sensing that Washington has created a vacuum of influence, have fallen flat, Gomart said. Now the poisoning of Navalny has made it harder for Macron. A scheduled meeting in Paris of French and Russian foreign and defense ministers in mid-September may not go ahead.
A meeting on Ukraine set for mid-September in Berlin, involving representatives of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, is also up in the air, a German official said.

Unlike the 2018 Novichok attack on a Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury, England, the poisoning of Navalny involves Russia using a nerve agent on its own soil for domestic political purposes, said Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London.
“Clearly, that offends the sensibilities of European politicians and citizens, as well it should,” Greene said. “It raises a different dilemma for Europe, the question of whether or not they are going to pursue sanctions against Russia for the way it conducts itself internally.”

Ian Bond, director of foreign policy for the Centre for European Reform and a former British diplomat in Moscow, said he expected Merkel would go first to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to investigate the poisoning, as Britain did after the Salisbury attack. After that she could raise the issue in the Security Council, the European Union and NATO.
The possible outcomes are targeted sanctions, the expulsion of more Russian agents from Europe and, if possible, international arrest warrants for those responsible, if they can be identified, he said.
But given the possibility that events in Belarus could get much worse, Bond said, the West must keep some sticks in reserve, like blocking Russian access to Western bond markets and increasing restrictions on the issue of Russian debt in the West.

Last Friday, Merkel said, “Our opinion is that Nord Stream 2 should be completed.” The project has important economic value, she said, adding, “I do not think it is appropriate to link this economically driven project with the issue of Navalny for now.”
But, as Schwarzer of German Council on Foreign Relations noted, with the identification of Novichok as the toxin, “the debate on Nord Stream 2 has resurfaced and is wide open now.”

3752,1021107590.xml,"      SAN JOSE DEL CABO, Mexico -- President Obama and other world leaders pronounced themselves united in the effort to increase growth and employment in the global economy on Tuesday, but appeared to make only modest headway in persuading Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to drop her opposition to more government spending to alleviate Europe's debt crisis.   Meeting in the desert scrub of Mexico's Baja region in an effort to lift the sputtering world economy, the leaders of the so-called Group of 20 eschewed specific commitments, instead limiting themselves to more generalized promises to invest in public works, overhaul labor markets and use innovation, education and infrastructure investment to fuel economic growth. A more detailed plan to address Europe's crisis is expected to emerge next week after a European summit meeting in Brussels.   The meeting did, however, appear to foreshadow a move toward deeper banking integration in Europe, including possible action to put together a banking union that would guarantee deposits. But such a pact is still a ways off, and leaders, worried that the lack of more aggressive action would roil already unsteady world markets, waited until the close of the trading day on Wall Street before releasing their official statements.   Ms. Merkel, who has been under increasing pressure from Mr. Obama and some of her European counterparts to ease up on Germany's austerity-first prescription for the rest of Europe, appeared to take heart from the victory on Sunday of pro-Europe forces in Greece, thereby confirming the fears of some economists and European and American officials who fret that the Greek results might remove the impetus for quick action.   ""Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made,"" Ms. Merkel told reporters. ""We cannot compromise on the reform steps we agreed on.""   With his own re-election chances directly tied to the European economic crisis as it drags down growth in the United States, Mr. Obama desperately wants Ms. Merkel to loosen the reins on spending and the austerity programs that have been imposed on Greece and the other struggling euro zone economies.    Toward that end, the president spent two days in Mexico shuttling between Ms. Merkel and other European leaders in an effort to get them to sign onto a specific pro-growth agenda. But for all his influence as the leader of the biggest economy in the world, Mr. Obama sometimes seemed a bystander, there to exhort and cajole the other European leaders (especially the German chancellor) but little else.    Mr. Obama acknowledged at a news conference at the close of the summit meeting that none of the steps announced here included ""a silver bullet."" But he added that he believed ""the sense of urgency among the leaders is clear.""   At times, the meeting of the world's biggest economies, occurring in almost a split-screen fashion as a fragile, new Greek government was trying to form in Athens, had a surreal atmosphere. The meeting's host -- Mexico -- serenaded reporters assembled for the closing news conference with Puccini's operatic Nessun Dorma, in what seemed like a plea to Europe's leaders to try to avoid further catastrophe.    The countries represented -- 19 nations and the European Union -- agreed to take the ""necessary actions"" to strengthen global growth and restore confidence, and promised that the euro zone countries would work to safeguard the euro's stability.    The agreement reached by the leaders did open the door to more lending and spending if the European economy worsens. ""Should economic conditions deteriorate significantly further, those countries with sufficient fiscal space stand ready to coordinate and implement discretionary fiscal actions to support domestic demand,"" the statement said.    The leaders seemed to hint that they had brought Germany closer to the notion of a more integrated European banking system -- like the American F.D.I.C. -- that would pay to insure deposits in the event of failing institutions. ""We support the intention to consider concrete steps toward a more integrated financial architecture, encompassing banking supervision, resolution and recapitalization, and deposit insurance,"" the statement said.   Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he was ""encouraged,"" and pointed to next week's meeting in Brussels as a chance to see the Europeans put more flesh on the bones of their banking union plans.   Ms. Merkel said during a news conference: ""From the side of the European Union, we argued unanimously and collectively that we are determined to solve the crisis, and to do it in a mix of fiscal consolidation, growth initiatives, and deepening of European cooperation. That reached very attentive ears here.""   But she added pointedly that a significant stimulus program, like the coordinated actions in the wake of the financial crisis, ""cannot simply be repeated,"" and even said that Mr. Obama agreed. ""The American president said, and we on the European side said, that doesn't work, the debts are too high for that.""   That may be an oversimplification of the American position, since Obama administration officials have spent the last year trying to point to the example of the steps that they took, including the stimulus, to jump-start the economy in 2008 and 2009.    American officials at the summit meeting hoped that for all of Ms. Merkel's tough talk, her hard line was starting to soften. One hope is that she and other European leaders will allow the European Central Bank to create low-interest Eurobonds by either pumping in cash or pooling German debt with that of the weaker euro zone members. ""We're seeing a shift in the European discussion regarding the critical importance of supporting demand and job growth,"" said Lael Brainard, the under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department.    A senior administration official said that the ""tone"" coming from the Europeans was, at long last, different from two years ago, and that the European leaders were starting to listen to Mr. Obama's lead-by-example message. ""There was a long period many times over two and a half years when we came saying the basic lesson of the fiscal crisis was to keep focused on making growth stronger,"" the administration official said. ""But a lot of people said they wanted to focus on the long term.""   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was ""a very welcome recognition of a significant change in tone by everyone now.""   The meeting has been taking place just as the fragile global economy is stalling again, with the United States the sole bright spot, but even that is relative, given that American employment growth has weakened again. Britain and European countries seem to be either in recession or on the edge of recession, and emerging markets like China and Brazil are not picking up the slack.   Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University, argues that political paralysis both in Europe and the United States have so hurt confidence that it has ""stunted the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.""

477,2202568774.xml,"One of the great political themes of the Democratic presidential campaign is how much everybody loves Joe Biden.Really. Just Google ""I love Joe Biden."" Go past the T-shirts and memorial coffee cups and you'll see a ton of stuff.""I love Joe Biden. He's a great guy and a great politician,"" said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho, when the question of a Biden return came up. ""I wish he were the president right now. But I'm not sure I wish he is president in 2021.""""I love Joe Biden. I really do,"" said Tom Courtney, a Democratic leader in Iowa. ""But there comes a moment when it's time to not run.""In the past, whenever Biden has tried to run for president, things didn't go well. In part it's been because of his tendency to sound ... goofy. In 2007, he described one of his opponents, Barack Obama, as the ""first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.""He didn't mean it the way it sounded, but he still finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses. He dropped out and became vice president. When asked about Biden as a possible successor, Obama just said, ""I love Joe Biden.""Now, Biden seems ready to give it one more shot. He hasn't announced yet, but he's ahead in the polls. And thrashing around in the controversy over his longstanding habit of affectionately putting his hands all over women he meets.""Social norms are changing,"" said the former vice president via Twitter. It was not quite an apology. More like: ""O.K., O.K. I'll do it another way.""Well, remember that old movie line about how love means never having to say you're sorry?On Wednesday, Biden sent out a video promising the world he'd be ""more mindful and respectful of people's personal space."" It was a pretty good presentation. He managed to look fairly normal, all things considered. When you've spent a week being savaged for old-uncle-creepiness, it's easy to get a little self-conscious.""I worked my whole life to empower women,"" he told the camera "" ... so the idea that I can't adjust to the fact that personal space is important, more important than it's ever been, is just not thinkable. I will. I will.""Two problems here. One is that Biden is acting as though the whole don't-touch business is a brand-new product of the #MeToo movement. That a person in his position could have accidentally missed the message until recently.Let's go back to 2006. At a G-8 summit in Russia, President George W. Bush came up behind German leader Angela Merkel and inflicted a quick back rub. Merkel appeared ... grossed out. The picture went around the world. Comedians had a field day. Hard to believe a powerful U.S. senator with an expertise in foreign affairs could have missed the story.A few months earlier, New Mexico Lt. Gov. Diane Denish had told a reporter she tried to avoid being around the governor, Bill Richardson, because ""He pokes me. He pinches my neck. He touches my hip, my thigh, sort of the side of my leg."" Like Biden, Richardson was a Democratic presidential hopeful.People were talking about it a lot. ""Have our leaders gone mad?"" demanded a Times writer, who traced the new touchy-feely trend to political consultants like Republican Frank Luntz, who were trying to create more human interaction between their clients and the public.Luntz was indeed encouraging his clients to go beyond the traditional handshake when it came to making contact. These days, he's still consulting but he's pretty clear that times have changed. ""What used to be seen as a demonstration of endearment is now seen as invasion of space,"" he said in a phone interview. Nevertheless, he loves Joe Biden. (""One of the warmest people I've ever met."")Second problem with Biden's video pitch. He has indeed worked to empower women -- he was an author of the Violence Against Women Act. But he also has that really nasty history on the Anita Hill matter. Hill had the courage to show up and testify before the world about Clarence Thomas's lecherous behavior as a boss. This was in 1991, when no one ever talked about that stuff in public. And Biden, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, did nothing but ask her embarrassing questions. (""Were you uncomfortable, were you embarrassed, did it not concern you?"")He's been trying to make amends, without really taking responsibility. (""I am so sorry if she believes that ... I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through."")Maybe that's why he made a particular point of lacing into Donald Trump's history of grabbing women's private parts. Last year Biden told some college students that if only he and Trump were in high school together, ""I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.""At the time, I wrote a column about the inadvisability of advocating an assault on the president, even in the past tense. And the next day Biden called up to say thanks ""for showing me what a jerk I was.""See, this is the reason people keep saying they love Joe Biden. Right before they say they hope he doesn't run for president.The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters to the editor.

2383,433406283.xml,"      Seeking to heal one of the deepest rifts between the United States and its European allies, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said here on Wednesday that the Bush administration had done a poor job of explaining its legal principles in its effort to prevent terrorism. But he also faulted European countries, which have criticized the American military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He said they were reluctant to take back their own citizens when released and had been insufficiently helpful in negotiating with other countries for the safe return of prisoners facing mistreatment in their own lands. ''We have repeatedly asked our European allies to join in these efforts,'' Mr. Gonzales said in a speech to a polite, skeptical invited audience. ''But despite demands that Guantanamo be closed, the United States has received little help from our European allies regarding the fate of these detainees.''  The diplomatic initiative by Mr. Gonzales comes amid growing concern over the conduct of German soldiers, including photographs that surfaced on Wednesday that appeared to show German troops in Afghanistan posing with a human skull. Mr. Gonzales declined to name the countries he said were being uncooperative with regard to returned prisoners -- especially, he said, while standing on a podium ''in this great country.'' His comment, delivered with a thin smile, seemed to suggest that Germany was among those the United States regarded as laggards. Germany's responsiveness has come under scrutiny in the case of Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish-German man who was imprisoned at Guantanamo for more than four years, partly because of Germany's reluctance to take him back. Last August, Mr. Kurnaz was finally returned home, eight months after a new chancellor, Angela Merkel, raised his case in a meeting with President Bush. In general, however, Mr. Gonzales seemed intent on reaching out to Europeans rather than rebuking them. ''There has been a lot of friction'' in the trans-Atlantic relationship, he said. ''We are partly to blame for that. We didn't do as good a job as we should have from the outset in explaining ourselves.'' Mr. Gonzales, the legal architect of some of the Bush administration's toughest policies toward suspected terrorists, said he was deeply disappointed that many people overseas did not believe that the United States, or Mr. Bush himself, were committed to protecting the rule of law. He defended American policies on the detention of ''enemy combatants,'' the rights afforded them by military commissions, and the role of the Geneva Conventions in the treatment of prisoners. Mr. Gonzales's European tour, which includes stops in Spain and the Netherlands, coincides with a growing concern here that Germany has compromised its own principles in helping the United States in its worldwide effort against terrorism. It also comes at a time when Germany published a proposed new defense policy that would pave the way for the country to play a bigger role in international peacekeeping missions. There are no fewer than five formal investigations under way here relating to terrorism and the German military. The issues raised include accusations that the Central Intelligence Agency transferred prisoners to secret prisons in Eastern Europe, and questions about whether the German government was aware of such transfers, as well as whether German soldiers mistreated Mr. Kurnaz in Afghanistan, as he contends, before he was sent to Guantanamo. The Defense Ministry denies that German soldiers abused Mr. Kurnaz. But the military has opened an investigation into his accusations. ''Our guys are supposed to be in Afghanistan to help stabilize things, not to kick around prisoners,'' said Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ''This embarrasses us and qualifies a bit our discussion about what American soldiers are doing in Abu Ghraib.'' The photos that appear to show the German troops posing with a human skull have added to the concerns. Some of the photos, published Wednesday in the mass-market newspaper Bild, depict the soldiers placing the skull on the hood of a jeep as a grisly emblem. Bild did not say how it had obtained the photos. The paper said they were taken in 2003 near Kabul, and involved German troops serving as part of the international security force in Afghanistan. The defense minister, Franz Josef Jung, has ordered an investigation. ''Such activities are diametrically opposed to the values and behavior we teach our troops,'' he said to Bild. Reports of military abuse carry an obvious historical echo in Germany, Mr. Perthes said, and could generate opposition in Parliament to the country's continuing involvement in Afghanistan. In particular, there are questions about the deployment of soldiers belonging to an elite rapid-response unit of the German Army known as the KSK. The activities of these troops in Afghanistan are cloaked in mystery. Parliament is also investigating whether the German government was aware of the possible C.I.A. activities in Europe. That has put Mrs. Merkel in an awkward position, since her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was a high-level adviser to her predecessor, Gerhard Schroder. The previous government is also under scrutiny in the case of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen who was abducted in Macedonia in 2003 and turned over to American agents, who flew him to Afghanistan, on the mistaken belief that he was involved in terrorism.

1893,923914684.xml,"      FRANKFURT -- Domestic politics in euro zone countries emerged again on Tuesday as a serious obstacle to resolving the European debt crisis, contributing to a decision by officials to postpone a crucial meeting they had planned for Friday. The setbacks illustrated again how hard it has been to reconcile impatient financial markets with democratic processes.   Ireland said it would hold a referendum on an agreement to impose fiscal discipline on members of the euro zone. The prospect of more political turmoil seemed to unsettle investors, even though the country's approval is not needed for the accord to take effect. Irish voters have a history of rejecting European Union measures at the polls; the euro dropped after the news before recovering.   In Germany, the constitutional court issued a ruling on Tuesday that was likely to slow parliamentary approval of emergency measures in response to the debt crisis. The ruling came a day after members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party rebelled against helping to pay for the latest plan to rescue Greece.   At the meeting on Friday, European leaders planned to discuss building a stronger financial firewall to prevent debt problems in one country from spreading to others. The delay means a decision to increase the bailout fund is not likely to come until later in March. The meeting had been expected to take place after a summit meeting of all 27 European Union heads of government, which will still proceed.   Darkening the outlook, an official report highlighted how much risk remained in the euro zone. Portugal faces a sharp contraction this year as austerity measures take their toll, the International Monetary Fund said in an assessment of the country's progress in overcoming its debt and economic problems. The warning came a day after Spain said that its budget deficit last year was much larger than expected, highlighting how difficult it is to cut borrowing and restore economic growth simultaneously.   Leaders outside Europe, including Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, have urged euro zone leaders to increase the firewall by hundreds of billions of euros, to at least a trillion euros, or nearly $1.35 trillion. But officials in Berlin say expanding the size of the fund could send a negative signal to financial markets while Greece is involved in a complicated bond swap. They contend that the move would sap confidence by implying that large countries like Italy or Spain were also at risk.   Other European leaders think the euro zone should take advantage of improved sentiment after the European Central Bank vastly expanded its low-cost loans to banks in recent months and officials made progress on a second Greek bailout. Increasing the firewall would restore confidence and help the euro zone emerge from an economic downturn, other leaders argue.   Still, the leaders decided it was not a good time to press Germany, said one official who was not authorized to speak publicly.   On Monday, the German Parliament approved its contribution to the latest Greek rescue package by an overwhelming majority, but 17 members of Mrs. Merkel's government voted against it and three abstained. That was a rebuke to Mrs. Merkel. German political parties expect loyalty from their members of Parliament. It is rare for them to vote against their own blocs.   Polls show that a large majority of Germans believe that attempts to save Greece are futile and a waste of their money -- a view shared by many professional economists.   ""How long will countries like Greece endure reform policies that are in many respects illusory?"" the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper wrote in a front-page editorial on Tuesday. ""And how long will taxpayers in the donor countries be willing and able to finance such grand political-economic experiments?""   A euro zone official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, ""Germany doesn't seem ready yet to swallow that pill, so it just made no sense to have a meeting that would put pressure on them.""   Irish voters would probably approve their country's participation in a euro zone fiscal discipline pact, approval that would be required were Ireland itself to need a second bailout. But the vote would be close, according to a poll cited by Reuters. Approval by at least 12 of the 17 countries in the euro zone would be needed for the pact to take effect.   In 2008, Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty, a measure to streamline the European Union's operations, but it later approved it after changes were made. It was not certain when the new vote would be held, but probably not for several months.   The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, has called for the resources of a temporary bailout fund to be combined with that of a new permanent fund. The permanent fund would have 500 billion euros. The temporary fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, has about 250 billion euros, of which about 100 billion will probably be used to finance the latest bailout of Greece.   Finance ministers in the euro zone will meet on Thursday to decide whether to go ahead with the bailout, which depends on Greece's carrying out additional spending cuts and measures intended to make the economy function better.   Christine Lagarde, president of the International Monetary Fund, said last week that the scale of the I.M.F. contribution to the next Greek rescue would depend upon Europe's willingness to increase the firewall.   Germany's highest court ruled on Tuesday that Germany must convene all 620 members of its Parliament to approve most emergency measures to be taken by the euro zone's rescue fund. The court said a nine-member committee set up to approve urgent action by the bailout fund was ""in large part"" unconstitutional. The panel could authorize only some government bond purchases by the bailout fund, it said.   Andreas Vosskuhle, the lead presiding judge, said in a televised announcement of the court's decision that it was based on the need to guarantee ""as much parliamentary legitimization as possible.""   The ruling Tuesday does not affect any existing German decisions on aid for struggling euro zone partners, but it does mean that future approval may take longer and become more difficult.   ""It demonstrates that the court remains a key hurdle with regard to the debt crisis,"" said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ""There is a dilemma between the need for democratic accounting and the need for efficiency and speed: gathering the Parliament for each E.F.S.F. money disbursement is quite cumbersome.""   In an update on Portugal's progress, a team from the I.M.F., as well as the European Commission and the European Central Bank, praised the country's progress in cutting its deficit, strengthening its banks and deregulating the labor market. But they warned that the economy was likely to contract 3.25 percent this year after falling 1.5 percent in 2011. In a statement, they said Portugal still needed to do more to remove impediments to growth, like dismantling quasi cartels that raise prices for local services.   ""Portugal is making good progress toward adjusting its economic imbalances,"" the three institutions said in the statement. ""Determined implementation of reforms remains key to ensure economic recovery and fiscal sustainability.""   Like all of the troubled countries, Portugal is trying to restore economic growth while sharply cutting government spending. On Monday, Spain reported that its budget deficit in 2011 was 8.5 percent of gross domestic product, much higher than had been expected, largely because regional governments did not meet their spending goals.   The European Commission indicated Tuesday that it was unlikely to relax financial targets for Spain despite news that the country was falling behind.   ""We are not talking about giving flexibility,"" Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the European Commission, said Tuesday, adding that member states needed to ""maintain commitments.""   In a bit of encouraging news, the European Commission's economic sentiment indicator, released Tuesday, rose in February to its highest level since October. The data suggested that an economic downturn that began in the euro zone at the end of 2011 could end soon. But there remains a large gap between northern Europe and troubled countries like Greece, Portugal and Italy.   The sentiment indicator ""confirms our expectation that the economic divide between the euro zone countries will remain substantial in 2012,"" Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

2811,433615508.xml,"      Was it something he ate? It seemed awfully mysterious when the new president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, emerged from his meeting with President Bush on Friday morning to greet the press -- sans Mr. Bush. Mr. Sarkozy, the newest addition to the small club of leaders who make up the so-called Group of 8, sauntered down a well-manicured lane alone and stopped before the cameras, only to dismiss inquiries about his American counterpart. ''I'm not his spokesman,'' he said. Soon, however, a spokesman appeared -- Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush, who reported that the president had awakened ''not feeling well to the stomach.'' Mr. Bush met Mr. Sarkozy in his private quarters and then retired for the morning, skipping a meeting with African leaders. Mr. Bartlett suggested it was perhaps the food. Recalling when the first President Bush threw up at a state dinner in his honor in Japan, the aide said, ''I guess he didn't want to follow in the footsteps of his father in Asia.'' By lunchtime, the president was ''feeling rejuvenated,'' in Mr. Bartlett's words, and back on track, though he was caught on camera rubbing his belly. (Later in the day, before a dinner with President Lech Kaczynski of Poland at Mr. Kaczynski's Baltic Sea retreat in Jurata, Mr. Bush was asked how he was feeling. ''Fine, thanks,'' he said, flashing a thumbs-up sign, though after two helicopter flights and a plane ride to get there, he looked a little peaked.) Mr. Bartlett, by this time, had revised his diagnosis. The meeting's host, after all, was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a strong Bush ally who perhaps would not have taken kindly to any inference that her accommodations were imperfect. ''The suspicion is there is some sort of bug, probably viral in nature, highly unlikely related to the food,'' Mr. Bartlett declared, adding that the president ''feels terrible about any disruption he may have caused to Chancellor Merkel's proceeding.'' Bush and Body Language Body language is everything when world leaders gather -- especially when one of those leaders is President Bush. But those who came to Heiligendamm expecting a reprise of the shoulder rub Mr. Bush gave to Mrs. Merkel at last year's Group of 8 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, were sorely disappointed. The president did not seem quite sure of the body language protocol when he saw Mrs. Merkel for lunch on the summit's first day. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain greeted the German chancellor in traditional European fashion -- with a kiss on each cheek. But Mr. Bush is not a kissy-kissy kind of guy, and anyway, how would a kiss look after the shoulder rub hubbub? So the president stood close to Mrs. Merkel -- but did not touch -- as the cameras rolled for their Heiligendamm debut. When they were done pledging mutual cooperation on climate change and exchanging the customary pleasantries, Mrs. Merkel extended her hand. Mr. Bush gave her a hearty shake and then, perhaps unable to resist, a couple of stiff claps on the shoulder. But not a rub. Transit Troubles It was planes, trains and automobiles -- or rather, helicopters, boats and a steam engine locomotive -- for members of the beleaguered international press corps, who tried valiantly to cover a summit that somehow always seemed just out of reach. The setting was idyllic: the sprawling Kempinski Grand Hotel here in Heiligendamm, the oldest seaside resort in Germany. The resort, in the former East Germany, is part of the region that serves as Mrs. Merkel's political base, and she hoped to showcase progress here since reunification. (Last year, in an effort to promote the place, she invited Mr. Bush to drop in on his way to St. Petersburg, and he did, dining on wild boar that had been especially prepared for him by a local restaurateur.) But showcasing progress this year meant bringing in the news media, and that proved a tricky business. Security was so intense that the village was all but sealed off, and the organizers planned for reporters to arrive from nearby Kuhlungsborn via a steam-belching locomotive. If the trains got full, buses were on hand. But both Plan A and its backup fell apart quickly when demonstrators blocked roads and laid their bodies down on the railroad tracks Wednesday. So the organizers turned to Plan B: German Army boats. The sea, alas, was choppy, and some journalists got sick. By Thursday, it didn't much matter; the army boats were docked when the protesters took to the water, engaging in a speedboat chase with the police. With President Sarkozy of France on the verge of holding a press conference with no French reporters on hand, the organizers invoked Plan C: helicopters. No telling how all that fuel-consuming transport fit in with the theme of the summit: combating global warming.  ",2007-06-09
3990,1037735675.xml,"       FRANKFURT -- The last time Mario Draghi addressed the news media after a meeting of the European Central Bank, on Aug. 2, he disappointed investors who wanted him to crack his whip and immediately bring bond markets to heel. The markets dropped even before Mr. Draghi was done speaking. Only in subsequent days and weeks did the bond markets calm down, as investors evidently absorbed his underlying message: that the central bank intended to take meaningful action against the euro debt crisis even if quick remedies were not possible. But this Thursday, when the central bank meets again, Mr. Draghi, the bank's president, could have a far harder time reconciling the expectations of twitchy financial markets with the limitations of his power. Although investors are counting on bold action, analysts say the bank probably needs more time to resolve internal differences and deliver on a promise to use its financial clout to tame runaway borrowing costs for the most troubled euro zone countries. ""Market expectation of Draghi's ability to maneuver may be exaggerated,"" said Marie Diron, a former economist at the central bank who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young. ""That could lead to a sell-off."" Some analysts do expect the central bank to cut the benchmark interest rate to 0.5 percent on Thursday, from its already record low level of 0.75 percent. Although that reduction might not impress investors as much as a bold intervention in the bond market, it could at least indicate Mr. Draghi's commitment to his July promise of doing whatever it takes to preserve the euro. The bank meeting is probably the central event, but not the only one, in what is likely to be a busy week for the euro zone. Political leaders will also continue making the rounds of one another's capitals to plot crisis strategy. One of the most closely watched meetings, also on Thursday, will take place when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, visits the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, in Madrid. Spain's debt drama seems to have entered a dangerous phase, with some of the country's biggest regions requesting financial aid from a central government already staggered by its own high borrowing costs. Mr. Draghi at least temporarily mollified markets last week with an opinion piece in the German newspaper Die Zeit that was widely interpreted as signaling the central bank's determination to begin buying the bonds of troubled euro zone governments, despite resistance from Germany. Exceptional measures may be required, Mr. Draghi wrote, ""when markets are fragmented or influenced by irrational fears."" Top European Central Bank officials have indicated that they are working overtime to determine how best to keep borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy affordable. Mr. Draghi and other members of the bank's executive board even canceled plans to attend the annual meeting this past weekend of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., saying there was too much to do in Frankfurt. So far, the mere promise of central bank action has had an effect. Since spiking in late July, bond yields, a measure of a government's borrowing costs, have fallen below 6 percent on 10-year debt for Italy and below 7 percent for Spain -- levels considered acceptable, if not exactly comfortable. But the yields, which have begun to edge higher again in recent days, are linked to expectations that Mr. Draghi will provide specifics of the central bank's bond-buying strategy at the news conference Thursday after the meeting of the central bank's governing council. Mr. Draghi is thought to have the support of most of the council's 23 members. But he must contend with stiff and vocal resistance to bond buying from Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank. The Bundesbank declined to comment Friday on a report in Bild, a German newspaper, that Mr. Weidmann had even threatened to resign in protest over the bond buying, a course of action that has become something of a tradition among disgruntled German central bankers. The Bundesbank would only refer to an interview published in Der Spiegel magazine last week, in which Mr. Weidmann said, ""I can carry out my duty best if I remain in office."" While Mr. Weidmann has been the only member of the governing council to object publicly to bond buying by the central bank, some others are likely to share some of his concerns. That group probably includes Yves Mersch, governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, and Erkki Liikanen, governor of the Bank of Finland. Spokesmen for the two men declined to comment. These quiet dissenters may already have won concessions from Mr. Draghi that could constrain a new bond-buying program. For example, their objections may well be the reason Mr. Draghi said last month that any bond purchases would focus on short-term debt. By buying bonds that mature in two years or less, the central bank would keep the pressure on countries to continue reducing debt and improving economic performance. Governments would know they needed to face investors again in a fairly short time. The concern is that constraints imposed by Mr. Weidmann and others could dilute the effects of bond buying, rendering it less effective. In any case, actual bond buying by the central bank is probably at least several weeks away. Mr. Draghi said in August that the bank would intervene in bond markets only in concert with the new European Union rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, or E.S.M. Countries would need to ask the rescue fund for help, Mr. Draghi said, and the fund would take the lead in bond buying, with the central bank providing backup financial support. But the fund, meant to replace a temporary bailout fund, is in legal limbo at least until the German constitutional court rules Sept. 12 on a challenge to the country's participation. While many analysts do not expect the court to block Germany from taking part, some have warned of such a risk. ""If the Court bans the German government from joining the E.S.M. for now, this will likely have major repercussions for financial markets,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients. At the news conference this Thursday, Mr. Draghi will most likely need to finesse the difference between investors' desire for instant gratification and the obstacles that remain before heavy-duty bond buying can start. The questions on investors' minds include whether the central bank will set upper limits on bond yields that it would defend at all costs. Probably not, analysts say, because it would be the equivalent of writing a blank check to the government issuing those bonds. Investors will want to know, too, whether the central bank will continue to consider itself a preferred creditor, which raises the risk for other investors if a country defaults.  Although the bank is expected to give up its privileged status in the debt market, that approach also carries risks. If the bank lost money on any bonds, taxpayers throughout the euro zone might ultimately have to replenish its reserves. (That is one of Mr. Weidmann's big concerns because Germany is the bank's biggest contributor.) A promise to expose itself to future losses might be credible only if the central bank took a hit on its existing holdings, namely an estimated 40 billion euros, or $50 billion, in Greek bonds.  This year, the bank refused to accept the losses on Greek debt that private bondholders agreed to absorb. But a decision to forgive some of Greece's debt would stir outrage in Germany and some other countries. Investors will also be asking how the bank, once it relieved market pressure, would ensure that countries like Italy would continue efforts to streamline their economies. Governments typically have trouble sticking to economic overhaul plans because doing so requires political leaders to challenge labor unions and industry groups that have stakes in the status quo. One method of punishing a backsliding country would be for the central bank to let that government's borrowing costs rise again. But that would risk accelerating the crisis. ""The central bank will probably not halt its purchases at the very point when the problems become more serious,"" Michael Schubert, an analyst at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients Friday. Addressing such technical and political questions Thursday, after what may be a contentious debate within the bank's governing council, could be the biggest public test yet of Mr. Draghi's rhetorical skills. He will need to keep his options open while still convincing investors that the central bank is willing to use overwhelming force to contain euro zone borrowing costs. ""Given the damage already done, any recovery in financial stability and economic activity will take time,"" analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note last week. ""But consistent and effective E.C.B. policy is a necessary condition for that. From what we've already heard from E.C.B. President Draghi, the E.C.B. may be prepared to deliver.""

4163,434061439.xml,"      Dieter Althaus,  the prime minister of the eastern German state of Thuringia and a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been charged with negligent manslaughter for his involvement in a fatal skiing collision with a Slovak woman on New Year's Day in upper Styria, Austrian prosecutors said. The woman, Beata Christandl, 41, suffered multiple head injuries and died at the scene. She was not wearing a helmet. Mr. Althaus, 50, who was wearing a helmet, also suffered serious head injuries. It is unclear if Mr. Althaus will seek re-election later this year.     ",2009-03-03
2819,1678708965.xml,"       BERLIN --  About 18 months ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel was the wronged American ally whose cellphone number was among data sucked up by American intelligence as it kept watch on Europeans. ""Spying among friends -- that is simply not done,"" she said after the discovery in autumn 2013, to a sympathetic domestic audience. Within the past two weeks, the tide has turned. Ms. Merkel is back in the spotlight over spying. This time it is Germany's foreign intelligence service, known here as the B.N.D., that is being accused of monitoring European companies and perhaps individuals. Further, the reports said the spying was done at the behest of the National Security Agency, the United States intelligence organization. Critics have seized on the spying allegations, sensing a whiff of hypocrisy emanating from Berlin, given the German outrage over the American program. On Tuesday, Austria was the offended party, filing a legal complaint against the German and American intelligence agencies over suspicions that it was being spied on, Reuters reported. Ms. Merkel's maxim about not spying on friends means ""she must be measured by it,"" said Stefan Kornelius, author of a biography of the chancellor and the foreign editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung. Government officials are also scrambling to head off accusations by some German news outlets and opposition figures that Ms. Merkel's government and some of her allies failed their constitutional duty to supervise the intelligence services and inform Parliament of the services' activities. Gregor Gysi, the vocal leader of the former Communists and other far-leftists in the opposition Left party, accused Ms. Merkel of ""treason."" The accusation was angrily rebutted on Monday by Gerhard Schindler, head of the B.N.D. He dismissed as ""absolutely absurd"" any suggestion that his agency was ""a compliant tool"" of the Americans. The details of what the German government did or did not do in collusion with the American government remain murky, caught up in the secrecy inherent in security matters. But the federal prosecutor is examining whether to begin a formal investigation. The regular parliamentary committee that oversees all intelligence services and a special parliamentary inquiry into the National Security Agency are also seeking more details and questioning key officials. The matter raises anew the questions that flared in 2013 with the release of American government documents by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, revealing the extent of American spying operations domestically and abroad. In the United States, Congress is now poised to reel in some of the surveillance measures that were adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But Germans reacted with revulsion when the extent of American spying on Europeans was revealed. Germany's memory of the Nazi and Communist regimes that spied on their citizens gave the revelations a special edge. Mr. Snowden is more of a popular hero here than elsewhere in Europe, and anti-N.S.A. sentiment remains high. At the same time, attacks by Islamist militants and the threat of homegrown extremists have challenged the intelligence equation in Europe. The French government is expanding its intelligence services' powers to combat terrorism. Ms. Merkel, asked on Monday whether her maxim about spying among friends still applied, said this was an ""important"" question and added, ""I think the answer should be that it should not occur."" But she recalled that she had noted in 2013 that it was necessary to strike a balance between liberty and security, and that this ""will continue to be my job."" ""There is an innate tension,"" she added. ""We must improve what needs to be improved through reports to the parliamentary control bodies. But on the other hand, even if it is not so popular right now, it is part of their job for our intelligence services, especially the B.N.D., that they must and will cooperate internationally to protect the bodies and lives of 80 million Germans as best they can."" ""First and foremost,"" she said, that means cooperation with the National Security Agency. In 2013, Ms. Merkel -- facing re-election, which she handily won for a third term -- succeeded in tamping down what is known here as the N.S.A. scandal. But it never went away. Since starting work last year, the special parliamentary inquiry into the N.S.A. affair has summoned witnesses, including former United States intelligence officials, who painted what many Germans see as a damning picture of American surveillance practices. The current flare-up started on April 23 when Der Spiegel reported that since at least 2008, a division of the B.N.D. had helped the National Security Agency to spy on European and German interests, including the French-German enterprise European Aeronautic Defense and Space, now known as the Airbus Group. Besides raising eyebrows about the scope of the spying operation, and the targets, the report questioned whether the German intelligence service had failed to fully inform the Chancellery or Parliament about it. The government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, acknowledged, without providing details, that the government had been working for weeks with the foreign intelligence service to assure that the agency was in compliance with the reporting rules. ""Technological and organizational deficiencies at the B.N.D."" were identified, he said, and the government gave ""immediate orders that they be rectified."" In a statement, he said the government would continue to keep parliamentary committees informed about intelligence activities, including the accuracy of the emerging allegations. The government will also examine whether information given to Parliament in the past continues ""to be accurate beyond any reasonable doubt,"" the statement said. The statement said there was no sign of current or past ""massive spying on German and European citizens."" But it omitted any mention of businesses or individuals, and whether they had been targeted. The most concrete indication that espionage might have occurred has come from Airbus, which filed a legal complaint last week against unnamed persons on suspicion of economic espionage and asked the German government for more information. Rainer Ohler, an Airbus Group spokesman, would confirm only that ""we are in contact"" with Berlin. Members of the German Parliament have suggested that Washington may influence how much the German government can reveal to Airbus.  Thomas de Maizière, a close Merkel ally who ran her Chancellery from 2005 to 2009 and was thus responsible for the intelligence services, has dismissed the spying allegations. Mr. de Maizière, now the interior minister, said on Monday that he had been involved in decisions against deepening certain ties with the National Security Agency in 2008, in order to protect German interests. Mr. de Maizière is to testify this week before the parliamentary inquiry. Committee members have demanded that the government release a list of the data the B.N.D. gave to the National Security Agency. In the meantime, pressure mounts on Ms. Merkel. On Monday, her No. 2, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the center-left Social Democrats who govern with her conservatives in a coalition, took the unusual step of describing two conversations with her to reporters. Mr. Gabriel had asked, he said, whether there was anything to the swirling allegations, and believed her when she said there was not. But, he noted, ""what we are witnessing now is an affair, a secret service scandal, which could set off a very grave tremor.""

3940,1892101383.xml,"WASHINGTON -- Ivanka Trump, juggling dual roles of White House adviser and daughter of the president, said in an interview aired on Wednesday that the United States might need to admit more refugees from Syria, a pointed public departure from one of her father's bedrock populist positions.Ms. Trump's comments, which seemed to question the basis for President Trump's two executive orders that tried to bar migrants from Syria and other predominantly Muslim nations, set off a minor scramble in the West Wing. Advisers grappled with a political problem unique to Mr. Trump's family-business White House: how to manage an officially empowered daughter who is prone to challenging elements of the president's conservative agenda.""I think there is a global humanitarian crisis that's happening, and we have to come together and we have to solve it,"" Ms. Trump told NBC when asked about the refugee crisis in Syria, which has created a nativist backlash in European countries.Asked whether that would include admitting Syrian refugees to the United States, she replied: ""That has to be part of the discussion. But that's not going to be enough in and of itself.""The remarks, in an interview that was recorded Tuesday, came at the end of Ms. Trump's rocky 24-hour trip this week to Germany, her first official foray since taking a West Wing office last month.A spokeswoman for Ms. Trump did not respond to questions about her position on immigration -- or about whether her remarks were intended to pressure her father.But two advisers to Mr. Trump, who declined to be identified talking about an internal White House dispute, described the statement as a political misstep. Her comments, they said, revealed a simmering private policy debate in the White House that pits Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, against hard-core nationalists like the president's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and the policy adviser Stephen Miller, who see the crackdown on immigration from Muslim nations as fulfillment of a core campaign promise to Mr. Trump's white working-class base.Breitbart News, the conservative website formerly run by Mr. Bannon, posted an article about her remarks that sat atop its list of most-read stories on Wednesday. It was followed by thousands of comments questioning Ms. Trump's commitment to the populist causes that propelled her rougher-hewn father to the White House.The United States admitted more than 13,000 refugees from Syria in 2016, before Mr. Trump proposed restrictions. Despite his hard line, support has been rising for admitting more migrants from the Middle East country, now in its seventh year of civil war; 58 percent of registered voters in a recent Quinnipiac University poll favored an increase in immigration from Syria, 14 percent more than in a survey conducted in late 2015.In the days after Mr. Trump's election, Democrats and some moderate Republicans expressed hope that Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner would act as a moderating and stabilizing force in a West Wing dominated by the mercurial Mr. Bannon, who viewed himself as a disrupter intent on dismantling major components of the federal government.That liberal crown has never fit perfectly: The husband-and-wife team, while powerful and socially progressive, have mostly been reluctant to challenge the president publicly and have lost significant battles, most recently an attempt to preserve federal funding for Planned Parenthood.Questions about Ms. Trump's ambiguous West Wing arrangement took center stage during the Berlin trip to attend the G-20 women's conference, where German political and media figures questioned whether her ascent was a product of merit or dynastic privilege.At one point, Ms. Trump was booed and hissed as she sought to defend her father's record on empowering women, and at times she struggled to define precisely what her responsibilities in the West Wing entailed.""I am listening and I am learning and I am defining ways in which I think I will be able to have an impact,"" she said.A person close to Ms. Trump said she took the mixed reception in stride, and said she was not surprised that her father's critics would vent their ire on her.Ms. Trump was deeply moved by televised images of children dying from a sarin gas attack this month in Idlib Province in northern Syria. But she denied a claim by her brother, Eric, that her reaction influenced the president's decision to launch a retaliatory missile strike on a government air base in Syria. In Berlin, Ms. Trump told reporters that this was a ""flawed interpretation.""But even the unveiling of her first major initiative -- to support female entrepreneurs -- hit another bump in Berlin.White House officials were taken by surprise when Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany announced at the Berlin summit meeting Ms. Trump's project, a World Bank fund to provide female entrepreneurs with financial and logistical services. The money would be part of a donor trust fund and go to women in developing countries, according to a World Bank official who briefed reporters on Wednesday.Ms. Trump -- who will promote the initiative through public and media appearances -- will not solicit funds or have authority over how the money is spent, according to a senior administration official, who declined to be identified by name when briefing reporters because the program was still being developed. Funding decisions will be made by corporate donors and the participating countries, including Canada, Germany and several Middle Eastern nations.The fund was Ms. Trump's idea, and was passed to the World Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, before he mentioned it to Ms. Merkel, the administration official said.Ms. Trump's position on Syrian refugees reflects a minority view within the White House, where she has taken on the role of trying quietly to affect her father's policies on the margins instead of applying the public pressure it often takes to sway the cable TV-focused president.But it also represented a view that her father himself once held.In a September 2015 interview with Bill O'Reilly, then a host at Fox News, Mr. Trump said he believed the United States needed to accept some refugees from Syria. ""I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to,"" Mr. Trump said.At another point he called it an ""unbelievable humanitarian problem.""But soon after, Mr. Trump backtracked, and said he did not want to see new refugees coming in.His daughter's comments not only roiled a White House that has been fighting a court battle to enact his executive order, the blocking of which Mr. Trump has viewed as an unacceptable defeat, but were also another reminder to her West Wing rivals that Ms. Trump is going to be treated as a policy adviser in her official government capacity.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.Credit: GLENN THRUSH and MAGGIE HABERMAN; Noah Weiland contributed reporting.Ivanka Trump at the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin On Tuesday.

4142,2087451440.xml,"MELENDUGNO, Italy -- When Alfredo Fasiello voted for the Five Star Movement this year, he believed the party would join his battle against a 545-mile, $5.2 billion pipeline to bring gas from the Caspian Sea to Italy, landing near the small beach club his family owns in San Foca, on the heel of Italy.Now that Five Star is a partner in government and its political leader, Luigi Di Maio, is the minister for economic development, the party's internal disagreements, apparent reservations and wavering on opposing the pipeline have left Mr. Fasiello and other southerners who helped vault the party to victory verging on revolt.
""We hoped they would have a trace of the honesty and transparency that they talk so much about. They were here 1,000 times,"" Mr. Fasiello, 62, said on a recent summer day.
""If Five Star betrays us, they will never win another vote here,"" he added. ""They'll be ashamed to show up on the beaches. It's not just this area. If they betray us, everyone will know not to trust them.""
Five Star came to power by harnessing Italy's anger toward politics-as-usual and big business interests, running a nationalist-themed campaign filled with conspiratorial overtones against globalist forces and suspicion of expertise and the elite -- whether it came to vaccines, economics or energy.
The Trans Adriatic Pipeline, or TAP, now poses an existential political problem for Five Star. The project has confronted the party, previously untested at a national level, with choices of governing in an interconnected world with real-life consequences.
Italy imports 90 percent of its energy, and the United States and the European Union have long pushed the pipeline as a strategic priority to wean the country off its dependency on Russian oil and gas and to reduce Russian influence in Europe.
While the relationship between the United States and Russia has grown more complicated under President Trump, he still appears to back the pipeline as a competitor to Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which he recently tweaked Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for supporting.
Sputnik, the Kremlin-aligned news outlet, recently called TAP ""Trump's Tool"" in an economic war with Russia.
Both Five Star and its governing partner, the League, are opponents of sanctions against Russia and proponents of closer ties to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, and neither party has seemed moved by a strategic motivation to limit Russia's sway.
Yet under pressure from the United States, the European Union and international business interests, Five Star is awkwardly walking back its opposition and stalling in the face of billions of euros in penalties and the loss of credibility for future investment.
Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, recently insisted that the pipeline needed to be finished to lower gas prices and help the country's impoverished south.
But the pipeline, scheduled for completion in 2020, has been bitterly opposed by many in Puglia, a region famed for its scenic coastline, turquoise waters and shimmering olive groves, and one that was critical to Five Star's electoral success.
""No TAP"" signs and graffiti cover the walls, dumpsters and boardwalks all around the southern coast. On a recent summer day, Mr. Fasiello took a walk with a fellow activist, Graziano Petrarchi, on the beach and pointed at a family sunbathing and children building a sand fort above the pipeline's projected route.
""Would you ever bring your child swimming here? With an atomic bomb underneath? It's a tumor,"" he said of the pipeline. ""It's three meters in diameter, and you can drive a car through it.""
The two recalled how Barbara Lezzi, a prominent Five Star politician from the nearby city of Lecce, who is now the government's minister for the south, built her campaign around her opposition to the pipeline and held flash-mob protests on the beach.
Beppe Grillo, the co-founder of Five Star, marched against the pipeline in 2014, and in April 2017, Alessandro Di Battista, the party's ""Baywatch""-worthy rabble rouser, visited the beach and promised that, once in office, Five Star would block the pipeline ""in two weeks.""
That time has long come and gone.
Italy's president, Sergio Mattarella, flew to Azerbaijan in July to guarantee that Italy would not impede the completion of the pipeline, which would connect with pipelines in Turkey and run through Greece and Albania to, finally, Italy.
That was enough for Marco Potì, 48, mayor of Melendugno, the tiny town near San Foca. A longtime socialist supporter, he instead voted for Five Star in March with every expectation that the party would live up to its promise to block the pipeline.
""He's never returned the letter of 97 mayors"" who wrote him opposing the project, Mr. Potì said as he reached up and removed Mr. Mattarella's portrait from the wall the very next day after the president went to Azerbaijan. ""But he shakes the hand of a dictator who crushes his people. He disrespected his citizens.""
In July, Mr. Trump pressed Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, on the issue during a meeting at the White House. Mr. Conte, who is aligned with Five Star, made Melendugno his first destination upon returning to Italy, where he listened to Mr. Potì's concerns and promised an ""in-depth assessment."" But he also called the project ""strategic"" for Italy.
Russia analysts say efforts in Bulgaria, Poland and elsewhere to diversify from Russian energy have spawned environmental groups, suspected of operating with Russian backing, that have slowed down or stopped the projects.
Mr. Potì ""completely excluded"" the accusations of Russian meddling. ""These are fables,"" he said.
There has been no evidence of Russian interference in the pipeline.
Activists say there is no need. Mr. Fasiello said the ""strategic"" rationale of the pipeline was a farce because Russia had found a way to sell its gas to Azerbaijan and to get it into the southern pipeline anyway.
""Sputnik and even Putin says that Azerbaijan will get gas from Russia,"" Mr. Fasiello said.
International agreements stipulate that for 25 years the initial 10-billion-cubic-meter volume of the pipeline can carry gas only from the Azerbaijani Shah Deniz fields, essentially excluding Russia.
But if the capacity of the pipeline is expanded, which the pipeline has been designed to do -- up to 20 billion cubic meters through additional compressor stations along the route -- other companies, including Russia's Gazprom, could reserve space.
Activists -- and Five Star leaders -- have said that they opposed the pipeline because it resulted from shady business deals and presented environmental risks.
They said the pipeline -- which is nearly complete in Greece and Albania and was built by companies including the British oil giant BP PLC and Italy's state-owned gas company, Snam S.p.A. -- was uprooting 1,600 olive trees and wouldn't bring down gas prices because stabilized prices and contracts would require the sale of gas whether people used it or not.
Michele Emiliano, the president of the Puglia region and a magistrate with links to law enforcement, said in an interview that the No TAP movement was ""probably infiltrated"" by antiglobalist forces, such as the radical Black Bloc, which have at times turned violent. But he rejected the suggestion that there was any Russian involvement.
""Sincerely, we have the impression that the Russians want to send their gas into TAP,"" he said. ""And that they aren't against it.""
Mr. Emiliano, a member of the Democratic Party, advocated an alliance with Five Star, which he said was ""elected to stop TAP"" but is having trouble finding the courage to tell its supporters that it won't.
He said he supported the pipeline, in part because it freed Italy from Russian influence, but he wanted it moved to an industrial zone farther north in Brindisi rather than having it arrive ""on one of the most beautiful beaches we have in Apulia.""
Instead, he said, out of pure ""stupidity,"" the private consortium running the project put it in the only place where environmental concerns were legitimate, as was the fear of sunbathing on top of a tube carrying more than a billion metric tons of gas.
""Even if usually they don't explode,"" he said, ""some explode.""
The consortium behind the pipeline has sought to allay concerns, arguing that San Foca presents the least environmental impact, including Brindisi.
""We've gone door to door to explain to people the reality and reassure they can put their umbrellas down like they're used to,"" said Davide-Maria Sempio, a local spokesman for the company in Lecce. ""They will not even realize there's a pipeline buried 15 meters under the beach.""

2198,433252375.xml,"      The election on Sunday of Michelle Bachelet as Chile's president completes a three-continent long jump for women in politics. Ms. Bachelet is the first woman elected president in Latin America who is not the widow of a political strongman. On Monday, when Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was inaugurated as president of Liberia, she became Africa's first woman to be elected president. And with Angela Merkel's election as chancellor of Germany, a woman now leads Western Europe's most populous nation. Ms. Bachelet, a socialist, an agnostic and a single mother, won the presidency of Chile, Latin America's most socially conservative country, with the help of a compelling personal story. She is the daughter of an air force general who died in prison during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule after months of torture, and she herself was imprisoned and tortured. When she was named defense minister in the current government, she was put in charge of a military still very much shaped by Mr. Pinochet. She brought an unpretentious style to the post, and won a reputation for toughness without rancor. These new chief executives are not the first women to lead major democracies. Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Indira Gandhi of India were vastly powerful politicians and global ideological icons as well. Golda Meir was the inspirational leader of Israel, a nation surrounded by hostile Arab neighbors that refused to concede its right to exist. But the women's successes in Liberia, Chile and Germany are being celebrated in part because this kind of achievement is still rare. In most countries, women have yet to achieve the critical mass at the lower levels of government that will be necessary if their ascension is to be seen as part of the normal course of politics. The recent elections are important because they stand in stark contrast with the other route women have taken to power: picking up the standard of a murdered father or husband. Most of those dynastic women have brought few qualifications to the job and have been dreadful leaders. Mrs. Gandhi was an exception. She won office as the daughter of the independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, but transcended her status as a dynastic successor as a powerful -- sometimes too powerful -- leader. The women who are now leading nations are the most independent and accomplished group of female leaders ever collected -- with the possible exception of when Elizabeth I dined alone.  ",2006-01-19
789,899076163.xml,"      Stocks in the United States fell and the euro erased gains as a split emerged between France and Germany on ways to increase the European bailout fund. In addition, Apple's shares helped lead tech stocks lower after its iPhone sales in its fiscal fourth quarter disappointed.   Technology shares fell 2.2 percent as a group and were the biggest drag on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple slumped 5.6 percent. The company's profit trailed analysts' estimates for the first time in at least six years as customers waited for the new iPhone model to go on sale.   The S.& P. 500 sank 1.3 percent to close at 1,209.88 after earlier climbing to 1,229.64. Financial shares in the index lost 1.7 percent as a group, reversing a 1.5 percent rally.   The euro was little changed at $1.375 after climbing 0.9 percent earlier.   Stocks, the euro and commodities turned lower as France and Germany disagreed on the role of the European Central Bank in leveraging the rescue fund, and banks lobbied against forced recapitalizations and larger write-downs of Greek debt. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France flew to Germany to join the talks as European leaders assembled in Frankfurt in an effort to narrow divisions before a summit meeting on Sunday.   ""Time is running out for Europe,"" Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said in a telephone interview. ""The longer it waits to fix itself the more uncertainty there is.""   Group of 20 finance chiefs last week set the Sunday meeting as a deadline for action by European officials. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany this week sought to lower expectations that the crisis-fighting effort would climax at the meeting in Brussels.   Separately, the Federal Reserve said the economy maintained its expansion last month, while companies reported more doubt about the strength of the recovery. ""Overall economic activity continued to expand in September, although many districts described the pace of growth as 'modest' or 'slight,' "" the Fed said in its beige book survey. ""Contacts generally noted weaker or less certain outlooks for business conditions.""   Alcoa, Bank of America and Johnson & Johnson tumbled to lead losses in the Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 72.43 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,504.62.   Many stocks that rose earlier on better-than-estimated earnings either pared gains or followed the market lower. Citigroup slipped 1.6 percent after earlier surging 4.9 percent. The bank agreed to pay $285 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had misled investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation tied to the American housing market in which the bank bet against investors.   The S.& P. 500 has rebounded 10 percent from a 13-month low on Oct. 3 as United States economic data and corporate earnings topped forecasts and speculation grew that European leaders would do more to tame the region's debt crisis.   A gauge of home builders erased gains after rallying earlier on a Commerce Department report that showed builders began work on 658,000 houses at an annual rate in September, up 15 percent from August and the most since April 2010. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 590,000 pace.   The 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 99 23/32, pushing the yield down to 2.16 percent, from 2.18 percent on Tuesday.   Crude oil slipped from a one-month high, falling 2.5 percent to $86.11 a barrel in New York.   The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed up 0.6 percent as optimism grew during the European trading session that officials would reach an agreement to increase the bailout fund.   Spanish bonds slumped after Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday reduced its ranking to its fifth-highest investment grade, cutting it by two levels to A1 from Aa2, with the outlook remaining negative.

1994,848988271.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- For a year, as Europe struggled with its debt crisis, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, lived up to her nickname of ""Frau Nein,"" or Mrs. No, by stalling on each rescue effort.   Suddenly Mrs. Merkel is saying ""yes,"" and that could mean a big leap forward in European integration.   When they meet here on Friday, the 27 heads of government will hear new ideas on how to save the euro, delivered by Mrs. Merkel and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, but written largely in Berlin.   In exchange for bolstering the euro zone rescue fund, Mrs. Merkel will press others to mimic Germany's economic rise. She is proposing to coordinate retirement ages across countries, scrap any links between wages and inflation and bring corporate tax systems closer together.   In  a remarkable about-face, Mrs. Merkel now wants more economic  integration in the euro zone, including regular meetings of its leaders.  That sounds similar to a French plan for a prototype economic  government for Europe -- something once considered so radical that Germany killed it.   But, after months on the defensive, Mrs. Merkel has finally decided that German leadership is good for the euro -- and for domestic politics, too.   According to Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, Europe's  director at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German research institute,  the shift comes after a year when her approach to the euro resembled the  posture of a small, furry animal ""waiting for the big snake to eat her up.""   Instead,  she wants to present herself as a leader in Europe, asking other  countries for concessions rather than being forced into making them  herself, he argued.   Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, now appears to agree with the euro's many critics that, without greater economic convergence, internal strains could make the currency unsustainable.   ""They  are realistic enough to have learned their lessons, which is that if we  want to have a stabilized euro we have to do much more we have to add  new elements to the system,"" said Mr. Fritz-Vannahme.   French officials are eager to dispel the impression that Paris has taken a back seat, or that there is a new Franco-German dictate coming.   Speaking  in Paris, Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, stressed that  these were French-German proposals and were not yet complete.   So no one should be suspiciously wondering ""what are the French and the Germans cooking up?"" she said.   In Berlin, Mrs. Merkel's adviser, Uwe Corsepius, briefed European Union ambassadors on the ideas this week and a draft document, prepared by one German ministry and circulating in Brussels, identified six priorities.   These  are: abolition of wage indexation systems, agreement on mutual  recognition of education qualifications, creation of a common base for  assessing corporate tax, adjustment of the pension systems,  establishment of a national crisis management regime for banks and new legal measures to force countries to commit to tough fiscal policies through a ""debt alert mechanism.""   Under the plan, countries will be measured against economic indicators, their progress verified by the European Commission.   Though  both Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy have been fiercely critical of the  commission and want to limit its powers, neither wants to create a new,  parallel structure.   In fact much -- though not all -- of Germany's plan was being pushed by the European Commission in its annual growth survey, or in its plans to strengthen the European Union's rule book with six economic governance proposals.   But that Berlin wants to make these ideas its own gives them vital momentum.   The challenge now is for officials to make a series of interlocking reforms into a coherent package by March.   The  reforms include plans to bolster the bailout fund for the single  currency allowing it, at least, to lend up to 440 billion euros ($608  billion) and possibly to be able to use its cash more flexibly.   In the meantime, the details of Germany's proposals  worry several euro zone nations. Ireland, Estonia and Slovakia, for example, dislike anything that touches on their right to set corporate tax rates.   Belgium will  resist efforts to break the link between earnings and inflation.  Raising pension ages is likely to be controversial across the bloc.   Even the Netherlands, which supports most of Germany's ideas, is sensitive to suggestions that it might have to alter an economic framework that has delivered growth.   One critical issue remains enforcing any agreement. The commission's plans to strengthen the euro's rule book included semi-automatic sanctions against countries that fail to curb deficits.   But these were diluted under a deal between Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy.   Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and leader of the centrist group in the European Parliament, argued that the only effective way of ensuring discipline was through ""the empowerment of the commission to act and set real sanctions.""   If  that cannot be achieved, another possibility might be to give countries  incentives to perform well, perhaps by using the new bailout fund more  flexibly and extending credit lines to weaker economies if they take tough measures.   Failing  that, Germany will have to rely on moral pressure and try to force  heads of government to sign up to commitments at special euro zone  summit meetings.   In any event, Mrs. Merkel's  engagement with the euro crisis is seen as essential to its resolution,  and her more assertive tone should also better equip her for a series  of different electoral tests in Germany this year.   ""She hates to be in a situation where she is pushed into things, and she was pushed for nearly nine or 10 months,"" Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said.

2338,304277498.xml,"      BERLIN -- If Germany's efforts to rein in speculation in European markets were meant to surprise investors, they succeeded -- just not quite in the way officials in Berlin might have intended.    On Wednesday, the government's partial ban on so-called naked short-selling took effect, as part of Berlin's effort to protect its biggest financial institutions and the euro currency from investors who have been betting against them.   Coinciding with the new rule, Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose rhetoric has intensified as the euro zone's debt crisis has spread, delivered a fiery speech to the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, that combined a demand for governments to assert ""primacy"" over unruly markets with her gloomy predictions of what would happen if they failed.    ""I'll boil it down to its core,"" she told lawmakers. ""The euro is the foundation for growth and prosperity"" in the European Union. ""The euro is in danger. If we don't deal with this danger, then the consequences for us in Europe are incalculable.""    Even as she spoke, markets were falling in response to her finance ministry's decision late Tuesday to immediately ban aggressive bets against the financial system. Markets closed down around 3 percent across much of Europe.   European officials, caught off guard, criticized Germany's unilateral action -- the kind of move that, just a few days ago, Mrs. Merkel said would be ineffective in a global market.    ""Close cooperation in the E.U. on all issues which have a strong market impact is very important and needs to be strengthened,"" the president of the European Union, Herman Van Rompuy, told a news conference in Madrid, Reuters reported. He said he would raise the issue of naked short-selling at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on Friday.    In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed assets hoping to buy them later at a lower price and pocket the difference as profit. In a naked short, the investor does so without actually having possession of the assets. Many Europeans have attacked the practice as casino-style speculation that can unfairly disturb the markets.    Several European countries, including France, Austria, Belgium and Spain, have prohibited naked short-selling of shares in their own major financial institutions since 2008. But outside of Austria, there appeared to be little immediate enthusiasm for following Germany's lead into new areas of prohibition, like government bonds.    ""There's relatively little trading of euro zone government bonds in Paris -- it's more active in Germany,"" Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, told reporters on Wednesday. ""So we don't envisage taking measures.""    Germany has long called for reining in what it sees as the worst excesses of Anglo-American financial capitalism. But the ban on some naked short-selling was seen as a political stance directed mainly at a domestic audience.   Mrs. Merkel opened debate in the Bundestag on Germany's contribution to the nearly $1 trillion safety net being set up by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for the euro zone's weaker members. Once again, Germany will provide the greatest share of the loan guarantees -- nearly a fifth.   Mrs. Merkel has been pummeled in the German news media over the previous bailout, which was specifically for Greece, and her coalition is still reeling after its huge election defeat two weeks ago in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia.    But the government's new aggressive attack on speculators won her admiring headlines as the debate over the larger bailout opened Wednesday.    The German financial regulator, BaFin, said Tuesday that it had banned naked short-selling of euro zone government bonds and was reinstating a ban on naked short-selling in the shares of 10 German financial institutions -- including Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and Allianz -- until March 31, 2011.    BaFin also enacted a ban on uncovered credit-default swaps on euro zone government bonds, meaning investors would not be allowed to buy default protection against debt unless they actually owned the underlying bonds.    The moves carry uncomfortable associations for investors, as they echo measures taken by the global authorities to calm markets as the financial crisis began building to a peak in 2008.    In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted several temporary bans against the naked short-selling of American banks that year, as did most major developed countries. Last July, American authorities tightened the rules governing naked shorting to curtail abuses.    Only on Sunday, Mrs. Merkel told the German Federation of Trade Unions that she opposed the idea of Germany taking any unilateral measures, since markets are global. Germany would require the support of the European Union as well as the United States, Japan and other countries, she said.    In fact, the majority of trading in sovereign European debt takes place well beyond the reach of German regulators, in London and New York. That left analysts and officials trying to understand how much impact the German measures would have.    A spokeswoman for the British Treasury declined to comment beyond a statement from the Financial Services Authority, the regulator, which said: ""We note what Germany has implemented and will assist BaFin wherever appropriate. The scope of these bans relate to German participants or business taking place inside Germany and does not cover branches of German institutions outside Germany.""    Mrs. Merkel is expected to try to win  more support for the ban on Thursday when she speaks at an international finance conference that will consider specifically how the markets can be regulated.

3595,1947719687.xml,"CORRECTION APPENDED. BETZIGAU, Germany -- Katharina Zinnecker's farm in the foothills of the German Alps has been in the family since 1699. But to squeeze a living from it today, she and her husband need to do more than sell the milk from their herd of cows.So they carpeted the roofs of their farm buildings with solar panels. And thanks to hefty government guarantees, what they earn from selling electricity is ""safe money, not like cows,"" Ms. Zinnecker said. ""Milk prices go up and down.""The farm has been a beneficiary of ""Energiewende,"" the German word for energy transition. Over the past two decades, Germany has focused its political will and treasure on a world-leading effort to wean its powerful economy off the traditional energy sources blamed for climate change.The benefits of the program have not been universally felt, however. A de facto class system has emerged, saddling a group of have-nots with higher electricity bills that help subsidize the installation of solar panels and wind turbines elsewhere.Germany has spent an estimated 189 billion euros, or about $222 billion, since 2000 on renewable energy subsidies. But emissions have been stuck at roughly 2009 levels, and rose last year, as coal-fired plants fill a void left by Germany's decision to abandon nuclear power. That has raised questions -- and anger -- over a program meant to make the country's power sector greener.This lack of progress is an ""illustration of the partial failure of the energy transition,"" said Artur Lenkowski, an energy analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. ""The whole point of the energy transition was to lower greenhouse gas emissions.""Now, Energiewende is at a crossroads. Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term as Germany's leader after elections last month, but her party lost sway. She must form a coalition with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Liberals, parties that have diametrically opposing views, including on environmental policies.How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allgäu, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker's family-owned farm.In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around [euro]40 million has been invested over the years -- much of it by residents -- into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.Günter Mögele, Wildpoldsried's deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village's decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents' shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.These big increases ""are absolutely not O.K.,"" said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.The higher prices have had political consequences.The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an ""immediate exit"" from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a ""burden"" on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program's mounting costs.Julian Hermneuwöhner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuwöhner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional [euro]800 a year because of Energiewende.""But it hasn't brought lower CO2 emissions,"" he said. ""It's frustrating that we're paying so much more, because the country hasn't gotten anything for it.""As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government's decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.The country has yet to address the transport industry, where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and France, Germany has not set a date to end the sale of diesel and gasoline cars.Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy.Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects -- though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.""Some of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,"" said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ""It is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.""Follow Stanley Reed on Twitter: @stanleyreed12.Correction:  October 10, 2017, TuesdayThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Saturday with an article about challenges facing Germany's clean energy industry misspelled the surname of a farmer in Betzigau, Germany, who, with his wife, has installed solar panels on his property.

1036,2390008396.xml,"The dismal economic picture darkened -- again.The latest measure of how badly the economy is faring came less than a week after the United States set another record for unemployment applications: The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales plunged 8.7 percent in March. Grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential sellers surged, but their numbers were offset by drastic declines in other categories.Separately, the Federal Reserve reported industrial production and manufacturing output sustained the largest drop since 1946. And several big banks, worried about the potential for defaults on loans, said they were stockpiling cash.Other estimates showed how much the economic pain the coronavirus pandemic has brought on in New York State, which has roughly a third of the coronavirus cases in the United States. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the virus might end up costing New York City more than $10 billion. ""Our revenue is gone, our tax base is gone, our economy is gone,"" he said.Almost the same figure came from another source. The Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, forecast a shortfall of $9.7 billion in tax revenue in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, a consequence of an estimated loss of 475,000 jobs over the 12 months that began on April 1. Mr. de Blasio said that the I.B.O. forecast was ""pointing in the right direction"" but added, ""We're going to lose much more after that.""The economic numbers from Germany were also disturbing, because they pointed to a steep recession. The German Economy Ministry said the country's second-quarter economic output would take a 10 percent nose dive. Even with an expected rebound later in the year, Germany's gross domestic product at the end of 2020 would still be 4 percent less than it was in 2019. The ministry also warned that unemployment would balloon.Face Mask Directives in New YorkGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who on Tuesday said President Trump ""basically declared himself King Trump"" after Mr. Trump asserted that he had authority over the states, said nothing but good things about the federal government on Wednesday. He praised the Army Corps of Engineers for turning the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan into a hospital and the Navy for sending the hospital ship Comfort to help the medical system deal with the huge increase in patients.He also issued an executive order directing the 19.4 million residents of New York State to cover their faces in public settings where they could not keep six feet away from others. ""If you cannot maintain social distancing, have a mask and put the mask on,"" he said during his daily briefing in Albany.It was the state's latest move to try to keep the virus from spreading. Mr. Cuomo said the mask order would take effect in three days.Mr. de Blasio had said earlier on Wednesday that New York City grocery stores should begin requiring shoppers to wear to what he called ""face coverings"" before letting them enter. He said he did not mean medical masks. ""We're talking about things like bandannas, scarves or the kind of masks you can buy, you know, in any hardware store, for example,"" he said during a briefing at City Hall. ""I want to see anyone who goes into a supermarket or a grocery store wear one of those.""He also said that a ""huge, huge percentage"" of people were already doing so.Mr. Cuomo's action went further, although Mr. Cuomo said he was not yet calling for penalties. He also said that for now, a failure to wear a face covering would not be cause for removal from mass transit.It did not appear that the two officials had checked with each other before making their respective announcements. The two say that they are in contact regularly and that their staffs talk every day. But they had not been seen together in public in six weeks, as of Monday. And Mr. Cuomo effectively equated the largest city in the state -- New York City -- with every other jurisdiction when he was asked if he had spoken with Mr. de Blasio about their differing mask requirements. ""We have 400 local government officials in this state,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""I have 700 school districts. I have 50-something county executives. We coordinate as much as we can.""Cautious Steps Toward NormalcyThe number of deaths from the virus remained alarmingly high: 752 more people died in New York State on Tuesday, the eighth day of the last nine with a death toll of more than 700. But a key indicator involving the number of virus patients in hospitals improved for the first time since the outbreak began. That indicator, the three-day average of the number of virus patients in hospitals, considered one of the most reliable measures of how the caseload is trending, fell 0.7 percent from Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo said.With the curve of the virus appearing to flatten, the when-is-this-over question surfaced again. Mr. Cuomo asked it during his daily briefing. ""I say, personal opinion, it's over when we have a vaccine,"" he said. ""It's over when people know 'I'm 100 percent safe and I don't have to worry about this.' When does that happen? When we have a vaccine. When do we have a vaccine? Twelve to 18 months.""For now, though, there are lockdowns -- and there is pressure to lift them. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany announced a cautious, step-by-step plan. The first step: Small shops can reopen next week. But a ban on gatherings of more than two people in public and a social-distancing requirement of 1.5 meters, or about five feet, will continue at least until May. Both had been scheduled to expire on Sunday.As the world knows, the pandemic has upended the mundane routine of life. Sometimes new, changed ways work, as South Korea demonstrated on Wednesday. Sometimes they don't, as Moscow discovered.Unlike Britain and France, which have postponed elections, South Korea went ahead with voting for its National Assembly. Voters wore face masks and stood three feet apart at polling places, where they also had their temperatures checked. People with high temperatures were allowed to vote, but in booths well away from where everyone else cast ballots.The election pitted President Moon Jae-in's Democratic Party against the main conservative opposition, the United Future Party, for control of the legislature. Mr. Moon's approval ratings have climbed as the country has appeared to bring the coronavirus under control. Over the past week, South Korea has reported fewer than 50 new cases a day.In Moscow, where a two-week-old partial lockdown has been widely ignored and Mayor Sergey Sobyanin has warned that the outbreak was likely to worsen, a new system of passes backfired. The passes, which everyone was ordered to carry beginning Wednesday, were supposed to limit people's movements and reduce the spread of the infection. But subway stations were choked with crowds and social distancing was forgotten during the morning rush because frustrated commuters had to wait while police officers examined their passes. Worried about a repeat of the near-chaos in the evening, the authorities backed away from strict enforcement.

1922,854360071.xml,"      Irish voters had every right to be angry at the catastrophic mismanagement of their economy. But the drubbing they administered to Fianna Fail, the longtime ruling party, by itself won't undo the damage that came from years of lax government oversight and disastrous policy choices.    The new government being put together under Enda Kenny and his center-right Fine Gael party must restore faith in government by fairly apportioning economic sacrifices, aggressively regulating lenders and ending cozy ties between politicians and bankers. Even then Ireland will have no chance unless it also gets more enlightened help from its European partners.    Mr. Kenny is rightly seeking to renegotiate the terms of last year's $112 billion bailout package. European Union leaders demanded deflationary tax increases and spending cuts that make it impossible for Ireland to grow its way out of debt and ruinous interest rates that will deepen those arrears. Funds that cost donors less than 3 percent must be paid back at close to 6 percent.    Ireland's ""Celtic Tiger"" boom of the late 1990s was no mirage. Today's problems began after Ireland started using the euro in 2002 and low interest rates and extremely lax bank regulation ignited a speculative housing bubble. When that burst in 2008, Ireland recklessly guaranteed the full liabilities of its six largest banks with public money. Those liabilities turned out to be far more than the government had or could raise, eventually forcing it into the European bailout. Now most of that borrowed money is going just to keep those banks afloat.   Meanwhile, Ireland's people have paid a terrible price. Unemployment, under 5 percent in 2007, is more than 13 percent and rising. As in the bad-old days Ireland thought it had left behind, growing numbers of young people are moving abroad in search of work.    On Friday, Mr. Kenny is scheduled to meet Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy. The next week, he attends a special euro-zone summit meeting, which will try to thrash out a grand bargain for restoring financial stability to the currency. That ambitious goal may not yet be in reach. Renegotiating Ireland's onerous bailout terms is. Irish voters have spoken clearly. European leaders should respond wisely. It is in no country's interest to lock Ireland into long-term economic ruin.       ",2011-03-02
1338,433412191.xml,"      FRESH from his never-in-doubt re-election as Berlin's mayor, Klaus Wowereit was soaking up the vibe at Popkomm, a music-industry trade show where the conventioneers favor fishnet stockings and motorcycle boots. In short: a typical Berlin scene. It is Mr. Wowereit's kind of scene, too, though the sunny, 52-year-old mayor was trying hard to look statesmanlike as he toured the floor with a scrum of television cameras. Famous for once being photographed at a party sipping Champagne from an actress's red pump, Mr. Wowereit politely declined the bubbly offered by the organizers, drinking water instead. Only when he spied a bank of headphones did the mayor break into a grin. Strapping on a pair, he bobbed his head to a new release by the American hip-hopper Lupe Fiasco. Later, Mr. Wowereit, whose nickname is Wowi, confided that his favorite pop singer was Madonna. Charming, sociable and openly gay, Klaus Wowereit (pronounced vo-vuh-rite) is the newest star in the German political firmament. It is a firmament short on stars. After his victory, the mass-market newspaper Bild ran a front-page headline asking, ''Will Wowi Be the First Gay Chancellor?'' ''Why not?'' Mr. Wowereit said in an interview this week, when asked whether Germans were ready for a homosexual leader. ''This doesn't have to do with a particular person, however,'' he added. ''It's an abstract question. One could also ask: can Germany have a female chancellor? We've seen that, yes, we can.'' The election of Angela Merkel, a brainy physicist-turned-politician from eastern Germany, has scrambled the assumptions about what is possible in German politics. While Mr. Wowereit deflects speculation about succeeding her, he is one of the few politicians in the country with real momentum. And his more sober demeanor is a sign of his national ambitions. ''I believe I have support nationally because of my policies,'' Mr. Wowereit said, noting that Berlin, with its aging population and fraying social safety net, is a microcosm of Germany as a whole. Still, he acknowledges the obvious complications. While being openly gay may seem almost bourgeois in hip, anything-goes Berlin, it is viewed differently in a small village in Bavaria. ''The mere fact that we're talking about it shows that it is still an issue,'' said Mr. Wowereit, who disclosed his homosexuality in 2001 with the now-famous line, ''I'm gay, and it's good that way.'' It has certainly been good for him here, where he has become a cuddly symbol of Berlin's openness and tolerance. When he took the stage to thank supporters from his Social Democratic Party on Sunday, he hugged his companion, Jorn Kubicki, a neurosurgeon 12 years his junior, saying, ''Anyone who knows me knows that he hasn't had it easy with me.'' At a time when German politicians are dodging difficult issues like health care reform, such forthrightness is appealing. In this often cranky city, two-thirds of the people approve of his job performance. THE mayor's popularity is even more remarkable given that Berlin is in many ways a shambles. It has a 17 percent unemployment rate -- well above the national average -- $77 billion in debt and an economy that has not grown in a decade. The last big private company with headquarters here, the drug maker Schering, was recently taken over by a rival in the Rhine Valley. Mr. Wowereit, a lawyer who came to power in 2001 after a financial scandal, tried to stem Berlin's red ink by trimming housing subsidies and the wages of government workers. But he barely made a dent, and the city has appealed to Germany's highest court to force the federal government to bail it out. Admirers note that Mr. Wowereit has been able to work in a coalition with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the old East German Communist Party, though he is now weighing whether to jilt it in favor of the Greens. He also bucked local resistance to break ground earlier this month on a new international airport in Schonefeld, south of Berlin. The project, which Mr. Wowereit described as the major achievement of his first term, will generate 7,200 construction jobs a year between now and 2012. Mr. Wowereit's critics say he is a lightweight who has avoided tough choices. Even those sympathetic to him are hard pressed to point to a big idea, beyond the airport, that he has championed. Berlin, he concedes, will never be able to attract the huge investments that would return it to its glory days between the world wars. ''The banks aren't coming from Frankfurt,'' Mr. Wowereit said. ''They're going to London. Volkswagen is not going to build a factory here. They're building new factories in Eastern Europe or Asia.'' The only solution, he said, is for Berlin to play to its strengths as a swinging town, a magnet for culture and tourism. ''This is the place to be at the moment, even more than London,'' he said. There are apparently very few visitors Mr. Wowereit would turn away: for the past two years, he has signed an official welcome message for a gathering of fetishists -- a practice that prompted conservative politicians to accuse him of contributing to ''moral degeneration.'' ''We are poor but sexy,'' Mr. Wowereit said in 2003, using another line that has become an unofficial slogan for Berlin. These days, he amends that, saying, ''I'd rather be rich and sexy than poor and sexy.'' Part of the mayor's appeal is that Berliners view him as a native son. Born in the working-class Tempelhof district to a single mother with five children, Mr. Wowereit was the first person in his family to go to college. He studied law and once dreamed of becoming a judge. BUT after joining the Social Democrats, Mr. Wowereit burrowed into municipal politics. In 1984, he became the youngest member of Berlin's city council. His hero is Willy Brandt, a mayor of West Berlin who later became chancellor and forged historic ties to East Germany in the 1970's. Mr. Wowereit's party-hearty image is a source of some amusement to people who have known him for a long time. ''He used to never go to the parties,'' said Michael S. Cullen, an American historian who has lived in Berlin since 1964 and advises the government on cultural affairs. ''In 1995 and 1996, he was studying the Berlin budget day and night. He knew every line item.'' The mayor, Mr. Cullen suggests, became more extroverted after he disclosed his sexual orientation. For his part, Mr. Wowereit said his busy social schedule consists mostly of promotional work on behalf of Berlin. His man-about-town image, he said, is largely a creation of the news media, and was exploited during the election by the Christian Democrats, in their fruitless effort to unseat him. If he were not mayor, Mr. Wowereit said, his idea of a perfect Saturday night would be to stay home and read a book or watch television. At most, he might join a small group of friends for dinner. ''I'm 53 next month, and it's not my thing to go to clubs and dance through the whole night,'' he said in September. ''That time is a little bit over.''

3774,1931099484.xml,"Berlin -- To many Germans, the violence in Charlottesville, Va., this month and the American president's reaction to it came as a shock. Even those who have come to expect little of Donald Trump -- he's a uniquely unpopular figure among Germans -- were aghast. ""It's racist, far-right violence, and that requires determined and forceful resistance no matter where in the world it appears,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said.What a strange moment, when the German chancellor lectures the American president on how to deal with neo-Nazis. But it's also an instructive one, in that it highlights how the two countries deal with extremism.In Germany, the very presence of neo-Nazis openly marching through a city bearing swastika-emblazoned flags, as in Charlottesville, is unthinkable. Unlike the United States, Germany places strict limits on speech and expression when it comes to right-wing extremism. It is illegal to produce, distribute or display symbols of the Nazi era -- swastikas, the Hitler salute, along with many symbols that neo-Nazis have developed as proxies to get around the initial law. Holocaust denial is also illegal.The law goes further. There is the legal concept of ""Volksverhetzung,"" the incitement to hatred: Anybody who denigrates an individual or a group based on their ethnicity or religion, or anybody who tries to rouse hatred or promotes violence against such a group or an individual, could face a sentence of up to five years in prison.These laws apply to individuals, but they and others are also defenses against extremist political parties. The Constitutional Court, Germany's highest court, can ban parties it deems intent on impairing or destroying the political order. This year the court came close to banning the extremist right-wing National Democratic Party but determined the organization was too weak to outlaw.This legal regime is backed by a political culture that effectively bans expression that might pass legal muster but still flirts with racist ideologies. The German right-wing-populist Alternative for Germany is a good example. Though its program and members do not openly embrace or reference Nazism, the party's program dabbles in ideas that might be construed as racist, and as a result the party is considered untouchable by mainstream voters and politicians.Germans have long argued over whether this legalistic strategy has worked. On the one hand, Germany's democratic system is remarkably stable; on the other, it has a severe problem with right-wing extremist violence that again has been rising steeply since the refugee crisis of 2015. And our laws and cultural taboos have not prevented the Alternative party from gaining a small but steady 8 percent of voters ahead of the national election in September.Furthermore, Germany's legal ban comes at a cost. Limits on speech are a blunt instrument. Though it seems a legitimate and necessary act of respect toward Holocaust victims and their descendants to outlaw the denial of the Nazi atrocities, the American way of dealing with Nazism and its symbols always seemed to me the more mature way of handling threats to liberal democracy.When in 1994, the Constitutional Court decided that denying the Holocaust was not covered by the constitutional right of freedom of expression, historians like Eberhard Jäckel argued that a truly liberal democracy should be able to allow for ""stupidity"" in its public debates. Germany's ban on the swastika seems like a permanent declaration of distrust in itself, and more important, to argument and to education. It feels like a hasty surrender.In a way, it is pointless to compare political cultures. Each is unique and deeply rooted in each country's history. We won't be able to copy America's unique liberalism, and the United States probably won't adopt our legalistic approach. However, there may be some convergence.Very cautiously, Germany is allowing itself to confront Nazi thought. For decades, Hitler's infamous book ""Mein Kampf"" was banned in Germany. But in 2016, when the copyrights owned by the Bavarian government ran out, it appeared in a critical edition for the first time, and it is now sold freely in bookstores.In the wake of Charlottesville and Mr. Trump's comments, I've heard some Americans bemoan the lack of strict anti-hate laws akin to Germany's. And indeed, the episode is a reminder that an open and educated discourse cannot be taken for granted, anywhere. But it has also demonstrated the resilience of America's civil society -- for now.Steffen Kailitz, an associate professor at the Technical University of Dresden's Hannah Arendt Institute who studies extremism, authoritarianism and failing democracies, said he found the reaction to Mr. Trump's statement about Charlottesville encouraging, because the broad backlash showed that in the United States, the taboos against racism and extremism remain intact.But, he added, frequent breaches of that taboo may slowly shift the boundaries between politically legitimate and illegitimate public expressions. Consider the number of Mr. Trump's supporters who approve of his position; many may not agree with white supremacy, but they are now less willing to condemn it because they are following the president's lead.In recent days, people in my Twitter feed have passed around a passage from the Austrian philosopher Karl Popper's 1945 book, ""The Open Society and Its Enemies,"" that in essence says that tolerance toward the intolerant cannot be infinite, or the tolerant risk eradication. That's Germany's militant democracy in a nutshell. And there may come a day when the United States must embrace it as well. But for now, I have faith in a democratic public's ability to police itself. I wish Germany did.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

2635,1948896714.xml,"BARCELONA, Spain -- What links an anarchist youth group, a conservative party of free marketeers and a left-wing party committed instead to enhancing the welfare state?The answer lies in the Catalan independence movement, which in the last seven years has morphed from a marginal force into a genuine threat to Spain's territorial integrity, largely through a marriage of convenience among several unlikely bedfellows.If this separatist alliance sounds fragile, unwieldy and paradoxical, that's because it is.The movement has ""nothing to do with the far-right nationalism that we see almost everywhere else in Europe, doesn't have any guru or strong leader, but it has instead something to do with almost every other ideology you could name,"" said Josep Ramoneda, a political columnist and philosopher.""That's both its greatest strength, because it's a movement that is really transversal, and its greatest weakness,"" Mr. Ramoneda said. ""Because it's so easy to divide and disintegrate once you discuss anything other than the goal of independence in itself.""And it fell under more pressure than ever on Monday, as the alliance's different factions debated into the night about whether and how to make a long-promised but long-delayed declaration of independence. It is now meant to be announced at some point on Tuesday.The decision was complicated further on Monday by a stark warning from a spokesman for the governing party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain that Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia, could be charged with insurrection if he declared independence. The spokesman, Pablo Casado, even drew an analogy with the fate of Lluís Companys, a Catalan leader who was imprisoned for proclaiming a Catalan state in 1934, shortly before Spain's civil war.The separatists must now decide whether to declare independence despite the resistance of Madrid and of leading politicians in the European Union. Chancellor Angela Merkel underscored Germany's support for a united Spain in a weekend phone conversation with Mr. Rajoy.The foundations of the independence movement have been shaky from the start. To achieve a pro-independence majority in the Catalan Parliament in 2015, the largest political group at the time -- the conservative and recently renamed Catalan European Democratic Party -- ran on a joint election platform with its main left-wing rival, as well as with a minor Christian democratic party and a small group of social democrats.This odd union was supported by some prominent Catalans like Pep Guardiola, a celebrated soccer coach, as well as the two main citizens movements that have organized mass street rallies in favor of independence since 2012.But the separatist coalition fell short of a parliamentary majority, allowing a small and leaderless far-left party, Popular Unity Candidacy, to step in and play the role of kingmaker in a Catalan Parliament dominated by separatists. The party is determined to secede swiftly, but disagrees profoundly with other separatists on how to then shape a new Catalan republic, starting with its rejection of the euro as a currency.The alliance is facing a major test on Tuesday, when separatist lawmakers are expected to vote on a unilateral declaration of independence.Hard-line and far-left separatists want a decisive and rapid break from Mr. Rajoy's national government, following the highly controversial Catalan referendum on Oct. 1 that had been suspended by Spain's constitutional court.But Mr. Puigdemont wants to keep on board the more moderate representatives of his own party, some of whom have grown wary about recent announcements of a corporate exodus from Catalonia. Ada Colau, the left-wing mayor of Barcelona, also called on Monday on both Mr. Puigdemont and Mr. Rajoy to take a step back rather than escalate the crisis.The situation ""is perhaps a little bit curious,"" said Jordi Cuixart, the head of Omnium Cultural, one of the two citizens associations that has been organizing the separatist rallies. ""The pro-independence movement has all different social sensibilities -- from left to right, including pro-liberal, socialist and communist.""To further complicate the picture, the broader independence coalition includes a far-left youth movement, Arran, which hopes independence will break the neoliberal economic order that it also holds responsible for problems like the rising rental prices in Barcelona tied to tourism. Last summer, as part of antitourism protests, members of Arran slashed the tires of a tour bus and daubed it with graffiti.Mr. Puigdemont's Catalan European Democratic Party ""is our class enemy -- we are against them,"" said Mar Ampurdanès, Arran's spokeswoman. ""But now we have a historic moment to break the Spanish regime, so we're with them.""After Spain's return to democracy in the late 1970s, Jordi Pujol founded Convergence, a conservative party that became the flag-bearer of Catalan nationalism. During his 23 years as the Catalan president, Mr. Pujol acted as a buffer between the Madrid government and more hard-line Catalan separatists, squeezing concessions and more autonomy from Madrid without ever calling for Catalan independence.Mr. Puigdemont's party is the successor to Convergence, but is a shadow of its former self, mired by corruption scandals and a tax fraud confession from Mr. Pujol himself. In fact, left-wing parties have been spearheading the independence movement since 2015, leaving Mr. Puigdemont as a captain under the permanent threat of parliamentary mutiny from the Popular Unity Candidacy.""It has not been easy,"" said Sergi Miguel, a lawmaker from Mr. Puigdemont's party. The prospect of independence ""is the only thing that keeps us together."" Some other issues, he added, are simply not discussed because lawmakers ""know it would be a war.""Mr. Puigdemont owes his job to a last-minute compromise with hard-line separatists who demanded the ouster of the previous Catalan leader, Artur Mas. Mr. Puigdemont, a former journalist, was seen as a more suitable choice in part because of his long track record of secessionism.Since then, Mr. Puigdemont's party has also had to accept left-wing demands over policies linked to education and support for low-income families, while winning in return support for a Catalan budget that hard-line separatists threatened to scuttle.Quim Arrufat, a leading voice within the Popular Unity Candidacy, acknowledged that Mr. Puigdemont's party had ""agreed to things we would never have imagined."" But he still insisted that ""we have compromised the most,"" citing his party's agreement not to scupper this year's budget.Some see the diverse nature of the independence movement as an asset, guarding it against accusations of xenophobia and extremism. ""This diversity makes us stronger and makes us better,"" said Benet Salellas, a Popular Unity Candidacy lawmaker.Catalan separatism also brings together some lawmakers who are not affiliated with any of the main parties but instead represent the different migrant communities that have helped transform the Catalan population, including a mass exodus from poorer parts of Spain to Catalonia in the decades after the civil war.""The fact that we don't all agree on what kind of Catalan republic we want is not a weakness, but proof that we all want the new Catalonia to be much modern than Spain -- and very, very democratic,"" said Eduardo Reyes Pino, a lawmaker who helped launch Súmate, a pro-independence association for Spanish-speaking Catalans.In the immensely tense current climate, as Mr. Puigdemont weighs whether and when to declare independence from Spain, the movement's diversity has nevertheless led to differences over the best course of action, Mr. Salellas said.Some on the right of the movement argue that ""perhaps we don't need to make any kind of declaration,"" said Mr. Salellas. ""And there are some people who want to make some kind of light declaration. And then there is us.""If there is any hesitation, then Barcelona should expect further civil disobedience, said Ms. Ampurdanès of Arran, the far-left youth movement.""Not just to pressure the Spanish government,"" she said, ""but to pressure the main Catalan parties to accomplish what they promised.""Credit: PATRICK KINGSLEY and RAPHAEL MINDER; David Meseguer and German Aranda contributed reporting from Barcelona, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Above, a Rally in Barcelona On Sunday Promoted Unity with Spain.

3280,1532895117.xml,"       BERLIN -- In a potential shift in German energy policy, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing a framework that would let energy companies extract oil and natural gas by the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The guidelines emerging from government discussions are strict, but they are a step, as energy companies have been barred from using the technology in recent years, even for conventional gas extraction. The government is responding to pressure from industry and consumers to develop new sources of fuel and reduce Germany's dependence on gas imported from Russia. With domestic production dwindling, almost 90 percent of Germany's gas is imported. Allowing fracking would open up the possibility of the production of oil and gas from shale rock in Germany. Analysts caution that there is unlikely to be any large-scale shale gas production in Germany soon. But the country does have potential. The Federal Natural Resources Agency, a government organization, has estimated that Germany has 2.3 trillion cubic meters, or 81 trillion cubic feet, of shale gas, enough to supply domestic consumption for about 30 years. But how much, if any, of this gas is recoverable is unknown because few exploration wells have been drilled to test flow rates after hydraulic fracturing, which involves pumping water, sand and other materials down wells at high pressure to cause the rock to release oil and gas. ""If you look at the numbers, it looks like lots of resources, but you don't know until you drill,"" said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Britain. Even if test wells showed potential, Mr. Stern estimates that it would be the better part of a decade before Germany had significant shale production. Still, Germany's industrial base would probably applaud even slow progress. ""We would welcome the establishment of a reliable legal framework and clearly defined rules for gas production with hydraulic fracturing in Germany,"" the chemical company BASF said on Thursday. BASF's oil and gas subsidiary, Wintershall, used hydraulic fracturing for many years to extract conventional gas but has been prevented from doing so recently because of rules against fracking. BASF and other companies also want the government to authorize shale gas production as a possible tool for lowering energy costs. ""It is necessary to find out more about the potential that shale gas actually has in Germany. Today, nobody knows whether shale gas development makes sense,"" the company said. BASF has been investing in plants in North America to take advantage of the low gas prices there. Should Germany move ahead with exploration of shale gas, it would join Britain as one of two countries in Western Europe permitting energy operators to look for so-called unconventional gas and oil. Britain is encouraging shale exploration in an effort to replace declining oil and gas output from the North Sea and to build up domestic sources of supply for industry, particularly power generation. If the energy industries in these two large European countries were to succeed in producing shale gas without serious environmental consequences, then pressure would build on other countries, including France, which is also thought to have significant shale resources, to change tack. The guidelines being discussed by Ms. Merkel's government would require environmental audits from two independent authorities and would impose a ban on drilling in areas where water is protected, according to a letter written by Sigmar Gabriel, the economy and energy minister, to a member of Parliament. In the letter, obtained by the German news agency DPA, Mr. Gabriel said he intended to put the law to a vote in Parliament, where Ms. Merkel's conservatives, together with the Social Democrats, hold a comfortable majority. ""The goal is to finalize these drafts in the coming weeks,"" the letter says. Mr. Gabriel said he hoped that the guidelines would be approved by the government before the summer recess and be put to a vote in Parliament by the end of the year. But the proposal would face stiff opposition in the upper house of Parliament, made up of representatives of Germany's 16 states, many of which oppose fracking. Opposition to fracking is strong in Germany. An attempt last year by Ms. Merkel's previous center-right government to pass a fracking law failed amid widespread concern about the possible contamination of drinking water. Environmentalists and other opponents worry about pollution of underground aquifers, disruption from truck traffic and other risks. Some environmental groups are flatly opposed to shale gas and oil as a new source of fossil fuels that might detract from investment in renewable energy sources. ""As long as I am governor in North Rhine-Westphalia, there will be no fracking for unconventional natural gas,"" said Hannelore Kraft, a prominent member of Mr. Gabriel's Social Democratic Party.

2182,356582663.xml,"      CORRECTION APPENDED BERLIN -- President Horst Kohler of Germany resigned Monday amid a barrage of criticism for remarks he made during a visit to Afghanistan.   It was the first time in four decades that a German president has quit the post, the nation's highest even though it is largely ceremonial.   Mr. Kohler set off the criticism when he said in an interview with Deutschland Radio, the public broadcasting station, that German soldiers serving in Afghanistan or with other peacekeeping missions were deployed to protect German economic interests.   His resignation was another blow for Chancellor Angela Merkel, a close friend and an important conservative ally. She had lobbied hard for him to become president, first in 2004 and again in May 2009, and his departure came just a week after another leading conservative politician, Roland Koch, resigned as premier of the state of Hesse, saying he had had enough of politics.   Mrs. Merkel said Monday that she regretted Mr. Kohler's decision to resign, adding that she had tried to persuade him to change his mind when he phoned her about his decision.    ""I was very surprised,"" Mrs. Merkel said. ""We had had a very good cooperation. I respect his decision.""   In the radio interview, which was conducted on May 22, Mr. Kohler, a former director of the International Monetary Fund, emphasized the importance of the nation's economy.   ""A country of our size,"" he said, ""with its focus on exports and thus reliance on foreign trade, must be aware that military deployments are necessary in an emergency to protect our interests, for example, when it comes to trade routes, for example, when it comes to preventing regional instabilities that could negatively influence our trade, jobs and incomes.""   In a short resignation statement delivered alongside his wife, Eva Luise, he said he regretted his remarks and the way he said they were misunderstood. He said he could not remain in office in the face of such intense criticism and loss of confidence.   ""I regret that my comments in an important and difficult question for our nation were able to lead to misunderstandings,"" Mr. Kohler said.   He complained that some critics had suggested he supported military ""missions that are not covered by the Constitution.""   ""This criticism lacks any basis,"" he said. ""It also is lacking in the necessary respect for the presidential office.""   He added, ""It was an honor to serve Germany as federal president,"" then walked off without taking questions.   Mr. Kohler's resignation is certain to lead to a fresh debate over the role of German troops in Afghanistan and in other international missions.   Denis MacShane, a British Labour legislator and German expert, said that Mr. Kohler was only speaking the truth but that German commentators did not want to recognize what he had said.   ""Kohler made the point that German military capability was relevant to German interests, including German economic interests,"" Mr. MacShane said.   ""As the world's second-biggest exporter after China it is self-evidently in Germany's interest to keep the world as open as possible for the free flow of trade and commerce. It is self-evidently in Germany's interests to help defeat the growing scourge of piracy.""   Mr. MacShane added that Mr. Kohler's remarks were ""grotesquely and cynically misinterpreted by the German press."" He added, ""He expressed the self-evident truth that German military power was now an expression of German national interests.""   Mrs. Merkel, who has come under repeated criticism from her own Christian Democratic Union party as lacking leadership ever since her new coalition of conservative and Free Democrats took office last October, had long tried to avoid dealing with Germany's new role.   With Mr. Kohler's resignation, analysts said Mrs. Merkel showed she was out of touch with what some of her closest allies thought.   ""Merkel has not got a firm grip on her party,"" said Nils Diederich, political scientist at the Free University in Berlin.   He added: ""It's as if she is out of her depth when it comes to deal with crisis over the euro, Greece, the future of Europe and Afghanistan.""   Opposition parties, after roundly criticizing Mr. Kohler last week, had only praise for him on Monday.   The Left Party, the only party that has consistently called for the withdrawal of Germany's 4,500 troops from Afghanistan, said they respected Mr. Kohler's decision to resign.   Gesine Lotzsch, leader of the Left Party, praised Mr. Kohler, saying he was speaking out about why German troops are involved in peacekeeping missions. His resignation showed why a major reassessment of Germany's foreign policy was needed, she said.   ""If that takes place as a result of the resignation of the federal president, then it will perhaps be a good signal,"" Ms. Lotzsch said.   Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats, praised Mr. Kohler's commitment to environmental issues and Africa, the president's two main interests.   Guido Westerwelle, foreign minister and leader of the Free Democrats, said he regretted Mr. Kohler's resignation.   A new president will have to be chosen by a joint session of the two houses of Parliament, the Bundestag, the lower house, and the Bundesrat, the upper house, by June 30.   In the meantime, the president of the Bundesrat, Jens Bohrnsen, the Social Democratic mayor of Bremen, will take over.

1377,1532444980.xml,"       BRUSSELS --  President Obama started his day in Warsaw struggling to convince his friends in Central and Eastern Europe that the United States is being tough enough with Russia. He ended his day in Brussels, still struggling, but this time to persuade America's core Western allies to stay tough with Russia. The dizzying contrasts underscored the challenges Mr. Obama faces navigating the complicated waters of European politics as he tries to forge a unified stance against Russian aggression in Ukraine. On the defensive at home for a prisoner swap, he finds himself pressed overseas by some allies unsatisfied with his reassurances of resolve and others unimpressed with his arguments for action. He arrived here on Wednesday to have dinner with the leaders of the Group of 7 powers who, at his urging, had excluded President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as punishment for his annexation of Crimea. But Mr. Obama's counterparts from Britain, France and Germany all ended up scheduling one-on-one meetings with Mr. Putin later on. President François Hollande of France even arranged to have dinner with Mr. Putin on Thursday just after having a separate dinner with Mr. Obama. Not only were they unwilling to snub the Russian leader entirely, as Mr. Obama sought, they were also reluctant to go along with other efforts to isolate the Kremlin. Most notably, the French government repeated that it would go ahead with the $1.6 billion sale of powerful warships to Moscow along with plans to train 400 Russian sailors in France this month. And other European leaders were cautious about setting further red lines threatening additional sanctions against Russia. Mr. Obama's aides repeated their opposition to the French sale on Wednesday but tried to play down the disparate approaches of the leaders.  ""The question is not whether they're meeting,"" said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser. ""The question is what people are saying in those meetings. And our belief is that there needs to be a unified message."" Others expressed concern. Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister who saw Mr. Obama in Warsaw and then traveled to Kiev later in the day, said Moscow was playing the allies against one another. ""I really hope the G-7 dinner tonight has produced the cohesion necessary,"" he said. ""It's only by sticking together that we can influence events. Russia is very consciously cultivating and using different bilateral links."" The leaders used their dinner on Wednesday to discuss what might set off another, more expansive round of sanctions. Some Europeans want to keep new sanctions in their pocket, as they put it, to impose only if Russia escalates the situation, while others say Moscow should avoid new penalties only if it proactively works to stop pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. After a long discussion, the leaders left the question largely unresolved. In a joint statement, they again condemned Russia's actions and called on the country to stop the flow of arms and fighters across its borders. But they did not specify what might prompt them to broaden their sanctions to target entire sectors of the Russian economy. Instead, they threatened ""to impose further costs on Russia should events so require,"" without elaboration. Unlike some other Western European leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel sided with the tougher line in a speech to the German Parliament before flying to Brussels. Mr. Putin ""has to make his influence felt"" with pro-Russian separatists who have attacked and seized government offices in eastern Ukraine and do more to prevent weapons flowing into Ukraine across porous Russian borders, she said. ""If all this does not stop,"" she told Parliament, ""then we will not shy away from imposing new sanctions."" But the French government repeated its refusal to cancel the warship sale, saying it would be illegal to break a contract under international law. French officials view the economic imperative as outweighing the geopolitical costs. ""France cannot bat aside these economic questions with the back of a hand,"" said Jean-Louis Carrère, who leads the French Senate's committee on foreign relations and defense, noting ""the serious economic difficulties"" the country is facing. They also disagreed with Mr. Obama's strategy of walling off Moscow from the outside world. ""We've tried not to isolate Russia,"" said a French official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss delicate a diplomatic dispute. ""How can you ignore Russia today? They are important actors in the Middle East. They are everywhere."" That Mr. Obama is caught in the middle may be frustrating to him, given that he does not seem eager for a confrontation with the Kremlin either, but he wants to avoid allowing Russian aggression to stand with impunity and feels pressure at home to take a tough line. Even within his team, there are cross pressures about how to respond, most recently over sending more troops to bolster the security of Poland and other NATO allies in the east. Mr. Obama sided with aides who advised against a more robust military presence in the east in the short term for fear that it would be unnecessarily provocative. But he did promise to spend up to $1 billion if approved by Congress to increase joint exercises, expand military training and preposition equipment. And in a speech in Castle Square in Warsaw on Wednesday before flying here, he had strong words of support. ""Poland will never stand alone,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Estonia will never stand alone. Latvia will never stand alone. Lithuania will never stand alone. Romania will never stand alone."" Mr. Obama was addressing a ceremony for the 25th anniversary of the elections that led to the eventual collapse of Communist rule in Poland, and he linked those stirring events to the current upheaval in Ukraine. ""The Ukrainians of today are the heirs of Solidarity -- men and women like you who dared to challenge a bankrupt regime,""he said. His message drew mixed reactions. ""The U.S. president did not miss the opportunity to say the right things in the right time and place,"" said Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a former Polish prime minister. But Witold Waszczykowski, a senior member of Poland's chief opposition party, Law and Justice, said that $1 billion for a region of 10 allies was not much. ""In the past 25 years, we heard a lot of nice speeches, also from other American presidents,"" he said. ""Now it's time to turn words into deeds. Because it's us who are neighbors with the greatest aggressor."" Mr. Obama met in Warsaw for the first time with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Petro O. Poroshenko, and pledged support for efforts to stabilize his country. Mr. Obama announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with $5 million worth of night-vision goggles, body armor and communications equipment long sought by its security forces. Secretary of State John Kerry also spent time talking with Mr. Poroshenko, privately urging him to provide evidence of Russian involvement with separatists with which to confront Russian officials. He plans to meet with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov in Paris on Thursday. Mr. Obama praised Mr. Poroshenko. ""I have been deeply impressed by his vision,"" he said after their 70-minute session. ""The United States is absolutely committed to standing behind the Ukrainian people and their aspirations, not just in the coming days and weeks but in the coming years.""

4266,1317092132.xml,"       BRUSSELS -- As the Syrian crisis entered its third year on Friday, the top rebel military leader declared that the opposition would ""never give up"" and asked for more support, even as a push by France and Britain to arm the outgunned rebels drew heavy resistance from other European countries.  Germany, Austria and other countries pushed back hard against a French-British effort to lift a weapons embargo on Syria to allow the arming of the rebels -- who say they desperately need antiaircraft and other sophisticated weapons to turn the tide of a war that has killed more than 70,000 people.  After a two-day European Union summit meeting in Brussels, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told reporters she worried such a step would ""just fan the flames of conflict."" Gen. Salim Idriss, the leader of the Free Syrian Army, sought Friday to rebut some key arguments marshaled against arming the rebels -- fears of sectarian conflict and extremist Islamist influence -- by declaring that the rebels welcomed all Syrians into their fold, including members of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect.  ""We, the Free Syrian Army, want freedom and democracy for all Syrians, whoever they are -- Sunni or Shia, Alawi, Christians or Druze,"" he said, naming Syria's major sects in a video address posted on the Internet. But two years after Syria's uprising started with protests over the arrests of young boys for spraying antigovernment graffiti in the southern city of Dara'a, supporters and opponents of President Assad often seem to be describing two different conflicts.  Opponents blame the president for responding to peaceful protests with overwhelming force and, when the rebellion took up arms, leveling entire neighborhoods with air and artillery strikes.  Supporters regard the rebels as foreign-financed extremists who threaten Syria's minorities. The influence of foreign fighters and donors has grown with the conflict, and some rebel groups have turned to indiscriminate weapons like car bombs.  As the two sides dig in militarily across an increasingly divided country, the human toll mounts, further destabilizing the region.  United Nations officials declared Friday that they had received barely one-fifth of the money needed to care for Syrian refugees for the first half of the year -- the worst shortfall in recent memory -- as their numbers grow at a staggering rate.  In December, when there were about half a million refugees outside the country, the number was expected to double by June.  But it surpassed one million last week -- and another 126,000 refugees have been registered since. ""It gives us a chilly feeling down our spine,"" Amin Awad, the refugee agency's Geneva-based emergency director, said in a telephone interview, explaining that it had committed more than half its stocks for global emergency responses to its Syrian operation.  ""This is the worst crisis in terms of funding in recent history,"" he said. ""We are basically living week by week.""  Yet with diplomatic efforts to reach a political solution stuck, and the world divided on whether to provide weapons to the rebels, there is no end in sight.  The United States said Friday that it would permit Americans to send money to Syrian rebel groups, modifying sanctions imposed earlier in the conflict that forbade any transactions with Syrians.  The change was bound to draw criticism from those who worry that money from the United States could end up financing movements that threaten American interests. The divisions at the Brussels meeting highlighted Europe's difficulties in speaking with a single voice on international issues, especially foreign military intervention. France and Britain, former imperial powers, take a far more activist approach to foreign affairs than do Germany and Austria, which have sought for decades to shed any hints of militarism left over from World War II. Diplomats said France and Britain were largely alone in their push to allow arms deliveries to opponents of Mr. Assad. Europe's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who is British, joined Mrs. Merkel in expressing doubts about the wisdom of lifting the arms embargo. France, which in January sent troops to Mali, a former French colony, to push back an offensive by Islamist rebels, is frustrated that months after the European Union expressed support for the operation, it is struggling to assemble a promised training mission for the Malian armed forces. Frances's president, François Hollande, said he drew hope from the fact that the Europe's position on Syria had already ""evolved"" from an initial refusal to provide anything but humanitarian aid to the February decision to funnel nonlethal but quasi-military aid such as flak jackets and armored vehicles. Ms. Merkel on Friday left open the possibility of a further shift, saying that she had ""not as yet come to a definitive position"" on the question of arms supplies.  She said that Ms. Ashton had presented a number of cautions about supplying lethal weapons, including the risk of instability in Lebanon, the wider Middle East and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who has for months demanded a more robust European policy in support of the rebels, told members of Parliament in London this week that if other European countries continued to block arms to Syria, Britain would be ready to act unilaterally. United Nations officials, meanwhile, have little leverage to pressure countries that pledged $1.5 billion at a Syria donor conference in Kuwait a few months ago to make good on their promises. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told reporters that given the almost daily headlines on Syria, ""we're a little surprised that this money is not coming forward.""

1798,2029353288.xml,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump will come under increasing pressure from visiting French and German leaders this week not to scrap the three-year-old nuclear agreement with Iran next month as American and European negotiators make tentative progress toward a new deal to toughen the limits on Tehran.President Emmanuel Macron of France arrived Monday at the White House for the first state visit of Mr. Trump's presidency, intent on using his unusual bond with the American president to try to persuade him to preserve the Iran deal, at least for now. While not as close personally to Mr. Trump, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will follow on Friday to reinforce the message.The back-to-back visits come weeks before a May 12 deadline set by Mr. Trump to ""fix"" the Iran agreement or walk away from it. Under the agreement, sealed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, Iran has curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. But Mr. Trump and other critics have assailed it because it begins to expire after a decade and does not block Iran's missile development or try to stop it from destabilizing the region.In recent weeks, American and European negotiators have made progress toward side agreements that would lay out new standards for Iran to meet or risk the reimposition of sanctions by the West. Negotiators have generally reached a consensus on measures to constrain Iran's ballistic missile program, according to people briefed on the talks, but remain divided over how to extend the restrictions of the original agreement due to lapse starting in 2025.Most importantly, the Europeans want assurances that if side agreements are reached, the United States will stay in the deal, a hard commitment for American officials to make given Mr. Trump's mercurial nature. But European leaders hope they can persuade him to hold off by showing enough progress in negotiations that he can claim he is making the deal better.""I suspect that this will be a very difficult conversation,"" said Wendy R. Sherman, the former top State Department official who negotiated the Iran deal for Mr. Obama. ""I'm sure that Macron will say how important staying in the deal is to a strong trans-Atlantic relationship in all things, particularly security. I think Merkel will deliver the same message on Friday.""Even so, the White House signaled Monday that Mr. Trump enters the talks with one set impression. ""He thinks it's a bad deal -- that certainly has not changed,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.The fate of the Iran agreement could influence the president's forthcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who already has a small nuclear arsenal. Whatever its flaws, American officials understand that canceling the Iran deal days or weeks before that meeting might complicate Mr. Trump's chances of making an agreement with Mr. Kim.Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, implicitly made that point Monday by noting that the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers involved give and take by all sides.""And now the United States is saying, 'What's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable. But whatever I gave you, now I want it back,""' Mr. Zarif said in an interview with The National Interest, a Washington policy magazine. ""Who would, in their right mind, deal with the U.S. anymore?""Mr. Trump faces conflicting positions among his own advisers as he reconstitutes his national security team. John R. Bolton, his new national security adviser, has long advocated simply ending the Iran deal, while Mike Pompeo, set to become secretary of state, is open to keeping it if strong new provisions can be negotiated.Mr. Macron arrived in Washington to a festive welcome. American and French flags flew on Pennsylvania Avenue as he and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were greeted at the White House by Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump.Mr. Macron reached in for a hug and kissed Mr. Trump on both cheeks, French-style, a sign of their warm ties. The two couples headed inside for a few minutes and then out to the South Lawn, smiling and chatting casually as cameras recorded the moment.Wielding shovels, the two presidents moved some dirt around where a tree was to be planted, a gift from the Macrons. The tree, a European sessile oak, came from Belleau Wood, where, during World War I, nearly 10,000 American Marines were killed or injured in battle in June 1918. From there, the two couples flew by helicopter to George Washington's Mount Vernon estate for dinner.The Macrons will return to the White House on Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, complete with members of all five branches of the military in formal uniforms. The two presidents will hold meetings and conduct a joint news conference. In the evening, the Trumps will host their first state dinner, featuring rack of spring lamb and Carolina gold rice jambalaya cooked New Orleans style.Mr. Trump, 71, and Mr. Macron, 40, have forged an unlikely friendship, despite their political differences over the Iran deal, international trade, climate change and other issues. But while Europeans consider Mr. Macron their envoy to Mr. Trump, he has had mixed success influencing the president. The two leaders teamed up to launch airstrikes against Syria this month in retaliation for a suspected chemical attack, but when Mr. Macron publicly said he had persuaded Mr. Trump to keep American troops in the country ""for the long term,"" the White House quickly disputed him.Mr. Macron telegraphed his message on Iran by appearing on the president's favorite network, Fox News, over the weekend.Is the pact ""a perfect thing for our relationship with Iran? No,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But for nuclear, what do you have as a better option? I don't see it. What is the what-if scenario or your Plan B? I don't have any Plan B for nuclear against Iran.""Mr. Macron added that he supported modifications to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. ""My point is to say, don't leave now to J.C.P.O.A. as long as you don't have a better option for nuclear, and let's complete it with ballistic missile and a regional containment,"" Mr. Macron said.Mr. Zarif picked up on that on Monday. ""President Macron is correct in saying there's no 'Plan B' on JCPOA,"" Mr. Zarif wrote on Twitter. ""It's either all or nothing. European leaders should encourage President Trump not just to stay in the nuclear deal, but more importantly to begin implementing his part of the bargain in good faith.""The negotiations with European officials, led by Brian Hook, the State Department's director of policy planning, have found some common ground, according to people briefed on the talks. Negotiators are developing two annexes, or side agreements, to the original deal, one intended to constrain Iran's missile program and the other to confront its aggressions in the Middle East.Negotiators have agreed on strong measures to impose sanctions on Iran if it tests long-range missiles and are debating a framework document to respond to testing of short- and medium-range missiles. They have agreed that Iran would be sanctioned if it blocks international nuclear inspectors from any site, including military sites. And they have made progress in defining a trigger for reimposing sanctions lifted as part of the 2015 deal -- if Iran were found to have expanded its nuclear program enough to allow it to develop a weapon in less than a year.But negotiators are divided over what would happen then. The Trump administration insists that sanctions be reimposed automatically if Iran trips that one-year wire, while the Europeans want the trigger to be a determination that Iran's expansion is inconsistent with its civilian nuclear program. If the Americans and Europeans ultimately agree, that would effectively end the expiration provisions known as ""sunsets"" by making the one-year limit permanent.""The Europeans have moved very far in a few months, and I think this should be bridgeable, but of course it really depends on Macron and Trump,"" said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""It sounds narrow, but it's actually pretty fundamental. It's entirely possible that the thing breaks down on that basis.""The Germans are the most resistant among the Europeans, arguing that renegotiating without Iran or the other parties to the deal, Russia and China, amounts to bad faith and ultimately will cause the original agreement to collapse. If no side agreements are reached, the Trump administration is also preparing contingency plans for Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran deal altogether and what the United States would then do to counter Iran.Russia and China have resisted any changes. ""We will obstruct attempts to sabotage these agreements, which were enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution,"" Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said Monday after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing.But critics of the deal pressed Mr. Trump to remain strong. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday again condemned the agreement. The deal ""gives Iran a clear path to a nuclear arsenal"" and ""does not deal with the ballistic missiles that can deliver this weapon to many, many countries,"" he said. ""This is why this deal has to be either fully fixed or fully nixed.""Follow Peter Baker and Julie Hirschfeld Davis on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @juliehdavisCredit: PETER BAKER and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS; Alissa J.

1817,1558703706.xml,"       BERLIN --  In an indication of Germany's growing role on the world stage, the country's top politicians on Sunday approved the delivery of thousands of machine guns and hand grenades, as well as hundreds of antitank missiles, to Kurdish forces battling Islamic militants in Iraq. Scarred by its militarism and two resounding defeats in the 20th century, Germany once shied away from conflict zones and limited its involvement to deliveries of humanitarian aid. But, although Chancellor Angela Merkel has yet to articulate a clear policy on intervention, she and her top ministers have dominated efforts to ease the Ukraine crisis. And on Sunday, they moved to approve the weapons for the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A solid majority in Parliament backs sending weapons, while opinion polls indicate that up to two-thirds of Germans -- weaned on decades of pacifism -- oppose the move. Ms. Merkel, fresh from a European summit meeting in Brussels at which Russia was given a week to pull back in Ukraine or face more sanctions, met senior ministers from both parties in her grand coalition government, and consulted with the leader of the Bavarian sister party to her Christian Democrats about sending the weapons to Iraq. Parliament is to debate and vote on the weapons deliveries on Monday, but officials said the government had the authority to act in this case without the parliamentary authorization that is required to deploy German troops outside NATO borders. The weapons are expected to go straight to Kurdish security forces, and delivery will occur only with the approval of the Iraqi government in Baghdad, according to German officials. The move was the latest sign that Germany, long an economic powerhouse, is playing an increasing role in global security crises. It has acted strongly before, under Ms. Merkel's predecessors, most notably deploying German forces as peacekeepers in the Balkans in the 1990s, and backing NATO's bombing campaign to drive Serbian forces from Kosovo in 1999. Germany has also been part of the international forces in Afghanistan deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. But in 2011, under Ms. Merkel, it stayed out of the campaign against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, even abstaining on a key United Nations vote. Germany has also remained one of the NATO members whose military spending is well below the 2 percent of gross domestic product sought by the alliance. But in January, President Joachim Gauck delivered a speech calling on Germans to step out of the shadows of their Nazi and Communist pasts and act more decisively, with military force if necessary. Mr. Gauck, whose office carries moral authority but no actual political power, received swift backing from the foreign and defense ministers. Often reluctant to weigh in decisively in crucial debates, Ms. Merkel has so far declined -- and did so again just last week -- to define her exact position. She has not, however, hesitated to plunge into diplomacy over Ukraine, conducting dozens of phone calls with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and repeatedly ruling out a military solution to the crisis. She conceded on Saturday in Brussels that sanctions had so far failed to defuse the conflict, which has claimed well over 2,000 lives. Over the past week, she said, ""the situation has escalated greatly,"" as it became ""quite clear that Russian weapons and also Russian troops are active in Ukraine."" ""If this situation continues or continues to sharpen, there will be discussion of new sanctions,"" she said. In the coming week, NATO leaders will gather in Wales and are expected to agree on new moves to curb the perceived threat from Russia -- particularly to neighboring, ex-Soviet bloc countries now in the Atlantic alliance. The newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, citing a confidential document and unnamed German officials, said Sunday that Germany would contribute some 150 troops to new planning and strategy offices to be established in Poland, Romania and the three Baltic nations. Like other European officials, Germany's chiefs of intelligence and senior ministers have also sounded an increasingly uncompromising tone toward ISIS, clearly alarmed by its fast-rising influence. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, noted Sunday that the very brutality of ISIS was drawing young German Muslim recruits. ""The Islamic States is, so to say, the 'in' thing -- much more attractive than the Nusra Front,"" the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Mr. Maassen told Deutschlandfunk public radio. ""What attracts people is the intense brutality, the radicalism and rigor. That suggests to them that this is a more authentic organization."" ""Al Qaeda fades beside the Islamic State when it comes to brutality,"" he said, estimating that at least five recruits from Germany had carried out suicide attacks in Iraq or Syria. His agency estimates that more than 400 people have traveled from Germany to join ISIS.  ",2014-09-01
2786,433616395.xml,"      The United States agreed Thursday to ''consider seriously'' a European plan to combat global warming by cutting in half worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, averting a trans-Atlantic deadlock at a meeting here of the world's richest industrial nations. The compromise, worked out in tough negotiations between the United States and Germany, also endorses President Bush's recent proposal to bring together the world's largest emitting countries, including China and India, to set their own national goals for reducing emissions. The agreement reached Thursday does not include a mandatory 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050, a key provision sought by Chancellor Angela Merkel, nor does it commit the United States or Russia to specific reductions. Nevertheless, Mrs. Merkel, the host of the Group of 8 meeting, proclaimed it a major victory. She had placed climate change at the top of the agenda for the gathering, and put heavy pressure on Mr. Bush in recent days to relax his opposition to mandatory cuts in emissions, though he ultimately did not. ''If you think of where we were a few weeks ago, and where we have reached today, this is a big success,'' a visibly relieved Mrs. Merkel told reporters in this Baltic Sea resort. The United States had threatened before the meeting to reject large parts of the German proposal, which reaffirmed the role of the United Nations as the primary forum for negotiating climate agreements. Now, though, the Bush administration has agreed for the first time to take part in negotiations to develop a new global agreement on climate policy by 2009. Such a pact could form the basis of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which has limits on gases that expire in 2012 and was never ratified by the United States. ''One of the features I think we all agreed to is, there needs to be a long-term global goal to substantially reduce emissions,'' Stephen J. Hadley, the White House national security adviser, told reporters. ''There are obviously a number of ideas as to how that should be done.'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who has long prodded Mr. Bush to embrace a stricter climate policy, said the agreement represented ''a very substantial coming together'' of the world's leaders. His comments came after he met one-on-one with Mr. Bush for the last time as prime minister. Environmental groups were more mixed in their reaction, with several noting that the agreement did not alter the Bush administration's refusal to accept binding targets for emissions reductions. ''He has only agreed to consider the goal,'' said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group. ''This is the kind of language that emerges from a discussion in which people say, 'We have to have something to take back to our publics.' '' Other advocates, though, said it was significant that the Bush administration had agreed to help negotiate a new climate agreement by 2009, within the framework of the United Nations. As recently as mid-May, climate negotiators for the United States were casting doubt on the need for any fresh treaty commitments. Mr. Bush's proposal last week to convene a conference of the largest emitters this fall stoked suspicions among some Europeans that he would pursue climate change on a parallel track with the United Nations. Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense, a New York-based group, said the spotlight would now shift to Congress, which is drafting legislation that may cap emissions in the United States. For Europeans, the prospect of a successor to Kyoto is important because it gives the prospect of stability to the market in trading carbon-dioxide credits, which was instituted by Europe as a way to meet its emissions caps under the Kyoto accord. ''The United States is now on a bandwagon they cannot stop,'' said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Mrs. Merkel's chief adviser on climate policy. ''That is more than I expected. In a way, climate common sense prevailed at the last minute.'' The 11th-hour deal came after weeks of intense diplomacy by Mrs. Merkel -- first to marshal support for her plan from other Group of 8 leaders, then to persuade Mr. Bush to edge toward her position. ''Merkel was focused, stubborn, and determined to reach a deal,'' said a senior German official who spoke on condition of anonymity, a standard practice in the German government. The chancellor had the support of Mr. Blair, as well as Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, with whom she brokered a separate deal to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Nicolas Sarkozy, the new French president, also voiced his support. Then last week, Germany received a crucial endorsement of its plan from Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is scheduled to take over the rotating presidency of the Group of 8 next January. But the German official said, ''It was about winning over Bush to get on board and support the U.N. process on climate change.'' Mrs. Merkel telephoned Mr. Bush in recent weeks, and met him for lunch on Wednesday, before the other leaders arrived in Heiligendamm. Another important step comes Friday, when the Group of 8 confers with officials of five developing countries. If ways cannot be found to foster emissions cuts in fast-growing countries like China and India, any progress in industrialized counties is likely to be swamped by rapidly increasing pollution, particularly in Asia. Mrs. Merkel, a physicist and former environment minister, staked a lot of prestige on a deal. While playing down hopes of a breakthrough, she instructed her chief negotiator, Bernd Pfaffenbach, to keep pushing for a compromise. Negotiators worked on the text all night Wednesday. At noon, just before Mrs. Merkel and the other leaders prepared for a forum with young people, she waved a draft of the communique before the group. ''Any objections?'' she asked. There were none. For the thousands of demonstrators outside the meeting, climate change has also been a consuming issue. In the morning, Greenpeace staged a spectacular stunt to try to deliver a petition to the leaders in their heavily-guarded hotel, calling for an agreement on climate change. Two Greenpeace dinghies -- one carrying a banner that said ''G-8, Act Now'' -- penetrated a maritime exclusion zone and raced toward the hotel, pursued by German police speedboats. The dinghies were forced back into open water and became engaged in a high-speed chase with the police on the Baltic Sea. The speedboats collided with the dinghies, tossing their passengers overboard. Three people were injured. A spokesman for Greenpeace, Daniel Mittler, subsequently dismissed the climate agreement, saying the leaders had failed to ''live up to their historic responsibility for causing climate change.''  Protesters clashed with the riot police yesterday at a road between Bollhagen, Germany, and Heiligendamm, where the Group of 8 leaders were meeting. Other demonstrators led the police on a speedboat chase. (Photo by Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters)  ",2007-06-08
241,2010643579.xml,"The Italian elections on Sunday were the latest powerful wave in a tidal turn of anti-immigrant, anti-European Union and antidemocratic fervor that has ravaged European politics. The vote was a stinging rejection of traditional parties, and of national leadership that has been frustrated by a flood of migrants from Africa and the Middle East and stymied by years of stagnation.While the populist parties that were the two biggest vote-getters were different in many ways, both want to abandon the euro and support for migrants, and shared conspiracy theories about bankers, vaccines and the 9/11 attacks.The lack of an outright winner or obvious coalition promises a long and wobbly slog before a government, most likely unstable, takes shape.The big winner, with about 32 percent of the vote, was the Five Star Movement, a grass-roots mélange of libertarians, progressives, Euroskeptics and other disenchanted voters formed less than a decade ago by a comedian, and now led by a 31-year-old college dropout, Luigi Di Maio.Next was the far-right League (formerly Northern League) led by Matteo Salvini, 44. An enthusiastic fan of Marine Le Pen's National Front and Donald Trump, Mr. Salvini fanned sadly familiar flames of nationalism, ethnocentrism and xenophobia, promising, among other things, ""cleansing"" Italy of immigrants, threatening force.The League ran with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. If there was a sliver of good news it was that the party of Mr. Berlusconi, forerunner of today's populists who was forced out as prime minister in 2011 in a swirl of sex scandals and legal troubles, took only 14 percent of the vote.The biggest blow was to the governing Democratic Party, led by Matteo Renzi until his resignation on Monday. It sagged to a mere 19 percent of the vote. The party, which has led Italy in a technocratic direction for the past five years, pulled Italy out of recession and had been trying to modernize its economy. But the nation's problems proved too great for it to resist the rise of extremism and demagogy.Whatever government emerges will have a tough time satisfying voters' expectations while coping with Italy's real economic problems, including the largest public debt in the European Union and high youth unemployment. As Greece learned earlier, it's one thing to rage against European rules; it's a far different thing to try to buck them.Italy now poses a major challenge to the European project, already badly battered by the Brexit vote in Britain and the illiberal drift of Poland, Hungary and other East and Central European countries. That promise of instability and uncertainty is no doubt being celebrated in the Kremlin. (Both the Five Star Movement and the League have argued against union sanctions on Russia.) Italy is not likely to quit the union or drop the euro, but a government hostile to both is a headache to Brussels and the deeper integration championed by President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. They will now need to decide whether to press ahead or hold off a while.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

2302,1564540746.xml,"       FRANKFURT -- A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment fell more than expected on Wednesday to its lowest level since 2012, intensifying worries that the eurozone's largest economy is at risk of slipping into recession. The stalwart German economy has anchored the rest of the eurozone during four years of intermittent crisis and uneven growth. Any pause in German growth spells trouble for countries like France and Italy, which depend heavily on trade with Germany, and are in much worse shape economically. The German economy already suffered a decline in the second quarter, when output fell 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Another consecutive quarterly decline would put the country into recession, according to a popular definition of the term. ""The eurozone's biggest economy has reached a dangerous stage between soft spell and longer-lasting almost-stagnation,"" Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. The survey by the Ifo Institute in Munich showed that its business climate index, a composite of managers' expectations for the future and their assessment of the current situation, fell to 104.7 in September, from 106.3 in August, the lowest level since April 2013. Within the survey, expectations for business in the next six months hit their lowest reading since December 2012, falling to 99.3, from 101.7 in August. The survey of about 7,000 managers measures sentiment compared with 2005, when the index was set at 100. > ""The German economy is no longer running smoothly,"" Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, said in a statement. The Ifo survey is the latest warning of flagging economic output in the eurozone, which has yet to recover to levels seen before the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. On Tuesday, a survey of purchasing managers in the eurozone by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, also signaled slowing growth. On Monday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told members of the European Parliament in Brussels that ""the economic recovery in the euro area is losing momentum."" The German economy has suffered from turmoil in Ukraine, which has unsettled consumers and businesses and made them hesitant to spend. The sanctions that the West imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, which added to existing weakness in the Russian economy, has sapped demand and weakened the ruble. In addition, German exports have been hit by sluggish growth in the rest of the eurozone and weak demand from developing countries like China. There has been talk in Berlin of stepping up spending on infrastructure such as autobahns or university campuses, but the government led by Angela Merkel has shown little appetite for immense fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, has expressed pride that the government will not need to borrow money next year. Each new sign of flagging growth raises expectations that the European Central Bank will soon resort to large-scale purchases of government bonds, the same so-called quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to spur growth in the United States. Economists at Barclays and Commerzbank, among others, expect the central bank to begin quantitative easing early next year. However, other economists doubt that the central bank is ready to risk alienating Germany, where many people regard government bond purchases by the central bank as a de facto transfer of wealth from richer European countries to poorer ones. ""The E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds,"" Joachim Fels, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, told reporters here on Wednesday. Most economists do not expect the central bank to announce plans to buy government bonds at its next meeting, on Oct. 2. The central bank has already said it would buy private sector debt, beginning next month, and was expected to provide details next week. Some economists consider fears of another eurozone recession overblown. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, noted that the United States economy also sputtered several times before regaining momentum. ""It's not uncommon during a recovery to have temporary pauses,"" Mr. Paulsen said in an interview last week. Referring to the eurozone economy, he added, ""What's been happening in recent months looks very familiar to me."" This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

3181,2340581758.xml,"As potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying over Libya and the fate of its precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance, the Continent is suddenly getting involved.BRUSSELS -- For more than eight years, the Libyan conflict has festered and the European Union has mostly looked away. Libya mattered, if at all, as a playground for terrorism and a source of the migrants disrupting European politics.But with the recent involvement of Russia and Turkey on opposite sides of a nasty civil war, adding to the meddling of other neighbors, Europe has suddenly woken to the implications of a new Great Game, this time in North Africa, that is rapidly destabilizing its backyard. Belatedly, the Continent is paying attention.On Sunday, after months of effort, Germany and the United Nations will gather most of the main actors to try to at least bring a sustained halt to the fighting and get outside powers to give Libyans the space to attempt to find some kind of political reconciliation.It will not be easy, as potential oil and gas bonanzas intensify the jockeying. Increasingly, the fate of Libya's precarious internationally backed government hangs in the balance.""There has been a major reawakening of geopolitical interest in Libya,"" said Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund and an expert on Turkey and the Mediterranean.""That begins with issues of migration, energy, security and counterterrorism,"" he added. ""But it is just as much about the geopolitics of relations with Russia and Turkey. If they had not been so assertive, Libya would not have attracted such attention now.""The new European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel that the bloc could even send troops to safeguard a potential cease-fire, a move that Italy and Greece have already suggested they would be interested in committing troops to.""If there is a cease-fire in Libya, then the E.U. must be prepared to help implement and monitor this cease-fire -- possibly also with soldiers, for example as part of an E.U. mission,"" he said.But Europe looks weak and peripheral. Kristina Kausch, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said, ""Now the Europeans are worried, but it's too late and we're out of the picture.""""Russia and regional powers are playing Europe in our own neighborhood,"" she added.The Libyan mess began with the 2011 overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi after intervention by European forces, with American help. Justified on humanitarian grounds, the war produced chaos when those same Western forces largely abandoned energy-rich Libya to warring militias.Many weapons of the old regime spread all over the sub-Saharan region, feeding other militants and terrorist groups, and producing thousands of refugees and migrants seeking safety in Europe.Libya remains a major transit and jumping-off point for sub-Saharan Africans hoping to make the crossing to Europe. Since the migration crisis of 2015-16, ""the E.U. viewed Libya mainly through the prism of the migration problem,"" said Claudia Gazzini, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group.Individual European countries, at the same time, pursued their own, divergent interests in Libya, often at cross-purposes.But the entry of Russian proxies into the conflict last year and, more recently, Turkey's pledge to send its own forces into the mix, meant Europe could no longer ignore the matter.It has also made the fissures in the Europeans' approach to Libya more and more untenable as the civil war turns into a wider playground for outsiders.On one side, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France and now Russia support Khalifa Hifter, whose forces have laid siege to Tripoli, the capital, threatening the internationally backed government there.On the other, Qatar, Italy and now Turkey support the Government of National Accord. Created by a 2015 United Nations-sponsored political deal, the government is led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj.The divisions between France and Italy have already split the European Union and weakened its positioning on Libya.As the European Union's top diplomat, Mr. Borrell has brought new thinking and ""a renewed energy and willingness to look at Libya as a crisis and a war in and of itself,"" said Ms. Gazzini of the International Crisis Group.In the last month, Mr. Borrell has repeatedly emphasized the dangers of Turkish military involvement in Libya and has criticized Europe's preference for citing international law as a response to every conflict.""We Europeans, since we don't want to participate in a military solution, we barricade ourselves in the belief there is no military solution,"" he told the European Parliament this week. ""Nobody will be very happy if, on the Libyan coast, there is a ring of military bases from the Russian and Turkish navies in front of the Italian coast.""He added in a Twitter message: ""But this is something that could very much happen. We need to engage strongly, keep Libya united and find a peaceful solution to this conflict.""That will not be so easily done.Just last week, Russia and Turkey brought both Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj to Moscow to get them to sign a permanent cease-fire agreement, another sign of Russian diplomatic activity to fill vacuums created by Europe and the United States.But Mr. Hifter, who believes he can still take Tripoli, refused to obey his Russian backers and left Moscow without signing.Some believe that he will agree to do so on Sunday in Berlin, and that his signature, sincere or not, will be a kind of gesture from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.The Trump administration, which had supported the Sarraj government and the United Nations process, reversed course last April, after a meeting with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to the International Crisis Group.But Washington is not very involved, and has just announced that it will sharply reduce the United States military presence in West Africa, intended to fight terrorism alongside the French, so the American influence will be further eroded.A senior State Department official said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who altered his schedule to attend the high-level meeting, would urge three things: the continuation of a cease-fire; the withdrawal of all external forces; and a return to a Libyan-led political process facilitated by the United Nations.But as with the European Union, there would appear to be little force behind those goals, and the messaging has stopped short of expressing support for the government of Mr. Sarraj.Historical alliances in Libya and interest in gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean are at the heart of the problem, and have raised the stakes for the outside parties.Migration aside, Italy, the former colonial power, and its energy giant, Eni, are key players in Libya. So stability matters for Rome, and the government has also tried to mediate between Mr. Hifter and Mr. Sarraj.But with the trend of the fighting moving Mr. Hifter's way, and Eni shifting to more commercial interests in the eastern Mediterranean, the Italian position has become more ambiguous.""Russian influence started first and foremost on gas and oil infrastructure,"" said Tarek Megerisi of the European Council on Foreign Relations.""If a situation unfolds whereby Russia and Turkey make peace, and Russia makes heavy investments in oil and gas infrastructure in Libya, that means that's one more pipeline into Europe that's in the hands of Russians,"" he added. ""That's quite dangerous.""For other Mediterranean neighbors, Greece and Cyprus, who stand to gain if gas exploration yields commercially viable finds, Libya is crucial.Despite the cacophony, the meeting in Berlin, if modestly successful, could begin turning the tide for European involvement in Libya, and ultimately for Libya itself, Mr. Megerisi said.""It's not that Europe is incapable, it seems that it's unwilling,"" he said. ""It doesn't have to be that way. They do have tools at their disposal. They do have some cards to play.""Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jason Horowitz and Emma Bubola from Rome.Migrants being rescued this month off the coast of Libya, a major transit point for refugees from sub-Saharan Africa.

1555,434019417.xml,"      BERLIN -- A deadly skiing accident in which a woman was killed and a powerful politician narrowly survived has captivated Germany, as a seemingly straightforward human tragedy has evolved into a criminal inquiry with political ramifications in a critical election year.    Dieter Althaus, the minister president, or prime minister,  of the eastern German state of Thuringia and an important ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, faces an investigation into involuntary manslaughter in connection with his collision on New Year's Day with the woman, Beata Christandl, on a ski slope at the Austrian resort of Riesneralm.    Ms. Christandl, 41, a Slovak who lived in the United States, was not wearing a helmet and died of her injuries. Mr. Althaus, 50, was wearing a helmet, but he remains hospitalized with head injuries.    Since the accident, German newspapers and magazines have been filled with conjecture about who was to blame -- with Mr. Althaus bearing the brunt of suspicion -- and photographs of the intersection of the two ski trails where the accident occurred, crisscrossed with arrows and lines describing the paths each of the skiers followed to their collision.    Both skiers were experienced, according to friends, but the location of the collision appears to indicate that Mr. Althaus hooked around a crash barrier and onto Ms. Christandl's slope.    Local tabloids have emphasized the birthday of Ms. Christandl's 1-year-old son two days after the accident, and the presence of Mr. Althaus's wife and his government deputy at her funeral on Wednesday in Austria. Ms. Christandl's husband, Bernhard Christandl, is an Austrian colonel working in Norfolk, Va., as a liaison with NATO.    Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Austria handling the case took the unusual step of issuing a news release on Friday declaring that neither Mr. Althaus nor Ms. Christandl had been drinking alcohol before the accident.   The release was issued, the office in Leoben in southeastern Austria said, because of ""increasing published speculation in German media over the possible inebriation of those involved in the accident.""    Walter Plobst, a spokesman for the Leoben prosecutor's office, said it would be at least four weeks before a decision could be made as to whether charges would be filed. Mr. Plobst said investigators were still awaiting results from the coroner and from an accident specialist working on the case. Mr. Althaus, whom doctors placed in an induced coma after the accident, was conscious but was not yet well enough to be questioned, Mr. Plobst said.    Mr. Althaus was returned to Thuringia by helicopter on Friday and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Jena, not far from the state capital, Erfurt. Speculation has run rampant in Thuringia about Mr. Althaus's political future, with the state holding its next election this August.    ""I have known Dieter Althaus for a long time, and he's a fighter by nature,"" said Andreas Minschke, the state general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union, the party of Mr. Althaus and Mrs. Merkel. ""From what I know, I am completely convinced that he will lead the C.D.U. in Thuringia in its election battles.""   Before the accident, Mr. Althaus's Christian Democrats were already down in the polls and straining to maintain control of the state Parliament, where they have an absolute majority.    Elections in the 16 German states are also important tests of strength for national leaders, in a party-dominated system that does not include the kind of momentum-building primaries seen in the United States. With Mrs. Merkel facing re-election in voting for the federal Parliament in September, a setback for Mr. Althaus's party in Thuringia could be politically costly for her.    ""He is very important for Mrs. Merkel because he is her closest follower in the circle of the minister presidents in Germany,"" said Gerd Langguth, a political analyst at the University of Bonn. ""It will only really influence the political outcome in Thuringia if the court will say that he is responsible for the accident. I'm not sure that Mr. Althaus could overcome that. Maybe then he would even have to resign.""    Beata Christandl, Top, a Slovak Who Lived in Virginia, and Dieter Althaus, Prime Minister of a German State.

1952,917278929.xml,"      BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Monday to impose a phased ban on oil purchases from Iran that officials said was needed to help force a shift in policy and avert the risk of military strikes against Tehran, as the United States expanded its sanctions to include the country's third-largest bank.    European Union countries will not sign new oil contracts with Iran and will end existing ones by July 1, foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said in a statement. The ban will cover imports of crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products. It will also cover the export of major equipment and technology for the sector. The European market accounts for about a fifth of Iran's oil exports.    ""To avoid any military solution, which could have irreparable consequences, we have decided to go further down the path of sanctions,"" Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, told reporters. ""It is a good decision that sends a strong message and which I hope will persuade Iran that it must change its position, change its line and accept the dialogue that we propose.""    The decision, while significant for the numbers of countries it encompasses, will do nothing to stop the flow of oil to Asia, a much larger market for Iran. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, Iran's top export destinations in 2010 included China, with 20 percent of exports; Japan, with 17 percent; India, with 16 percent; and South Korea, with 9 percent. Europe's biggest importer was Italy, with 10 percent.   The American move targeted Bank Tejarat, the 23rd financial institution in Iran now subject to American sanctions, even as the Obama administration considered including the country's central bank in its restrictions.    ""At a time when banks around the world are cutting off Iran and its currency is depreciating rapidly, today's action against Bank Tejarat strikes at one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system,"" the Treasury under secretary for terrorism, David S. Cohen, said in a statement. ""Today's sanction against Bank Tejarat will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous, and further impair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program.""    The European ministers said the assets of the Iranian central bank within the European Union would be frozen, with limited exemptions to permit the continuation of legitimate trade, the ministers' statement said. ""Trade in gold, precious metals and diamonds with Iranian public bodies and the central bank will no more be permitted, nor will the delivery of Iranian-denominated bank notes and coinage to the Iranian central bank,"" the statement said.    The European measures include a plan to review the economic impact of the oil ban on certain ailing European Union members, notably Greece and Italy. But officials said such a review would do no more than possibly delay sanctions in certain areas.    Western politicians believe Iran is building a nuclear weapons capability, but the government in Tehran insists that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Amid the heightened tensions over the standoff, Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic corridor for Western energy supplies. Two Iranian lawmakers repeated that threat on Monday.    European diplomats said tougher sanctions were their best hope of reducing the risk of a military strike against Iran, probably by Israel. Israel has publicly agreed that sufficiently tough sanctions could force an economically shaky Iran to comply with international demands to curtail its nuclear program.    The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called the new sanctions a ""step in the right direction.""    ""True, it is still impossible to know what the result of these sanctions will be,"" Mr. Netanyahu said. ""Very strong and quick pressure on Iran is necessary. Sanctions will have to be evaluated on the basis of results.""    In a statement, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel; and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, described the measures as ""an unprecedented package of sanctions on Iran.""   ""Iran has so far had no regard for its international obligations and is already exporting and threatening violence around its region,"" the statement said. ""Until Iran comes to the table,"" the three leaders added, ""we will be united behind strong measures to undermine the regime's ability to fund its nuclear program.""   American officials welcomed the decision in Brussels.    ""The measures agreed to today by the E.U. Foreign Affairs Council are another strong step in the international effort to dramatically increase the pressure on Iran,"" said a statement released by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. ""This new, concerted pressure will sharpen the choice for Iran's leaders and increase their cost of defiance of basic international obligations,"" they added.   But the reaction from Moscow was critical. ""In essence this is an attempt to strangle an entire sector of the Iranian economy,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""It is clear that this is pressure, diktat, an attempt to punish Iran for intractable behavior. As we have told our European partners before, this is a mistaken policy. Under this kind of pressure, Iran will not agree to any kind of concessions or change in its policies.""   In a separate statement, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that ""we have continued hope that negotiations will be resumed soon.""      Credit: STEPHEN CASTLE and ALAN COWELL; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels, and Alan Cowell from London.

2135,1612189712.xml,"       BERLIN --  Like two next-door neighbors who have had a bit of a falling out over their divergent economic circumstances, Germany and France seem to be making a special effort to make up.  On Wednesday, Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, became the first in that post to attend a German cabinet meeting. The visit, which the French Foreign Ministry said ""reflects the dynamism of French-German relations,"" followed a similar cabinet session in Paris in May attended by Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Since they signed the landmark Élysée Treaty in 1963, the Continent's two biggest powers have developed a closeness unseen between any other two European nations, particularly countries that battled each other for centuries. But gaping differences in economic status and philosophy have darkened the mood in recent months. The German economy is still growing, and unemployment here was 4.9 percent in September, according to the European Union's statistics office. By contrast, the jobless rate in France is stubbornly stuck at 10.5 percent, and the French government has defiantly insisted that it will not meet European Union deficit targets until 2017. Speaking privately, German officials have expressed alarm at the unpopularity of President François Hollande, whose Socialist Party garnered barely 14 percent of votes in European parliamentary elections in May. The rise of Marine Le Pen and her populist National Front, which won 25 percent of the vote in May, worries Berlin, where Chancellor Angela Merkel remains popular after nine years in power. Ms. Merkel's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, came under fire at meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington last weekend for sticking to his declared goal of balancing the federal budget here. Many outside experts and even influential German economists have urged the government in Berlin to loosen the public purse strings to stimulate German and European growth. So far, Mr. Schäuble has declined to do so, and he won vocal backing from the Social Democrats with whom Ms. Merkel's center-right party governs in a coalition. Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrats' leader, said Tuesday that there was no need to change course even as he announced that the government was now projecting just 1.2 percent growth in Germany this year, down from 1.8 percent predicted earlier. However, both Mr. Schäuble -- perhaps the most vocal advocate in the government of European integration -- and Mr. Gabriel seem eager to engage the French in new common projects to overcome the perceived rift between Europe's indispensable couple. The Finance Ministry announced Wednesday that two German ministers would host their French counterparts, Finance Minister Michel Sapin and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, on Monday in Berlin. Hours later, Mr. Macron unveiled a blueprint for proposed legislation intended to help lift competitiveness in France's flagging economy, a move that appeared to nod at German demands that France push structural overhauls faster than the government has been doing. The measures include plans to allow shops to open on Sundays and late into the evening, and to open the market for notaries and aspects of the legal profession to new competition. ""We need to remove all obstacles that impede growth,"" he said at a news briefing. In addition, according to a document seen by Reuters recently, Mr. Gabriel and Mr. Macron have assigned two influential academics, one in Paris and the other in Berlin, to come up with ways to expand cooperation. They are expected to present their ideas in November. Credit: ALISON SMALE; Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.  ",2014-10-16
