1,1638785406.xml,"       In less than three weeks, Britain's David Cameron and France's  Francois Hollande have set out starkly contrasting approaches to  immigration, while Angela Merkel has warned fellow Germans against  manipulation by far-right xenophobes. The divergent stances of the three heavyweight leaders show how  hard it will be to agree on any reform of European Union policy on  migrants, which Cameron has set as a goal before a promised 2017  referendum on Britain's membership of the bloc.  Each is responding to growing anti-immigrant, anti-EU populist  movements that threaten the long dominance by mainstream parties of  the center-left and center-right.  Cameron has chosen to dramatize the immigration issue and make it a  test for Britain's EU membership in an attempt to undercut rising  support for the UK Independence Party before a general election  next May.  He is demanding that the EU change its founding treaty to make it  easier to crack down on unemployed migrants and alleged welfare  abuses.  Studies show that immigrants from other EU states are big net  contributors to the welfare system and make fewer claims than  British citizens, but Cameron wants to ban them from receiving  benefits for the first four years worked in the country.  He has set -- and missed -- a target of bringing net migration  below 100,000 a year, far fewer than the 260,000 recorded in the  year to June.  Across the Channel, France's Socialist president presented a  diametrically opposed view on immigration last week in his first  speech on the sensitive topic in 2 1/2 years of power.  Trailing the far-right National Front and the conservative UMP in  opinion polls, Hollande urged the French to embrace immigration as  an economic and cultural boon to their country, and not to heed  those who argue France is losing its secular identity due to the  spread of Islam.  He defended the level of new arrivals, which at roughly 230,000 a  year are only slightly fewer than Britain's. Most are spouses or  children of existing residents, entitled by law to join them, or  refugees legitimately seeking asylum, he said.  ""There have always been demagogues who exploited a few breaches of  our common rules to justify rejection,"" Hollande said, denouncing  those who play on fear and ""dream of a little France, a spiteful  France, a France turned in on itself.""  Hollande was positioning himself in opposition not only to National  Front leader Marine Le Pen, who depicts France as overrun by Muslim  immigrants, head scarves and halal meat, but also against former  President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, attempting a comeback as the UMP  leader, has vowed to suspend French membership of the EU's Schengen  zone of passport-free travel until it is reformed to tighten  controls, a position Hollande called ""a backward step.""  In Germany, Merkel has distanced herself from weekly demonstrations  by mostly unaffiliated rightists against Muslim immigration, which  are gaining momentum.  She has urged citizens to reject racism and stressed that Germany  needs immigrants to help cope with a dwindling population.  ""We have freedom to demonstrate in Germany, but there is no place  for incitement and insulting people who come to us from other  countries,"" Merkel said last week after a poll showed voters want  her to pay more attention to the protests.  Political analysts say Merkel faces a risk that the protests fuel  support for the anti-euro Alternative for Germany, which narrowly  failed to enter parliament last year and has since won seats in the  European Parliament and several state legislatures.

2,1490634763.xml,"       2nd attack near army base in Pakistan; 13 dead PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- A suicide bomber struck near Pakistani army headquarters Monday, killing at least 13 people, including six soldiers, in the second major attack on security forces in as many days.   Eighteen were wounded in the bombing in the city of Rawalpindi when a bicyclist blew himself up as police tried to stop him near a military checkpoint, authorities said.   The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, just as the group had for the previous day's attack, when a bomb exploded inside an army base in northwestern Pakistan as a convoy of security forces was preparing to depart for the volatile North Waziristan region. The area is in the tribal belt near the border with Afghanistan, where soldiers and paramilitary forces have been battling the militant organization.   At least 22 soldiers were killed and 30 wounded, many of them critically, in Sunday's bombing.   The attacks mark a significant escalation in the Pakistani Taliban's campaign of assaults and raises new questions about Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's efforts to engage the insurgent group in peace talks. Taliban leaders have said that they are ready for talks but continue to carry out violent attacks.   In response to the violence, Sharif canceled a visit to Switzerland, where he was to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos.   Before the attack in Rawalpindi, law enforcement agencies had received intelligence about the potential presence of a suicide bomber, according to officials.  Blast outside Afghanistan base kills coalition soldier   A suicide bombing at the entrance to a base in southern Afghanistan used by the U.S.-led military coalition killed one international soldier Monday, Afghan officials said.   Nine assailants were gunned down in the attack, which took place outside a coalition base near Zhari, a district in Kandahar province, long a hotbed for Taliban militants, said Jawed Faisal, a spokesman for the provincial governor.   The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.  Obama vow fails to ease Germany's spy concerns   BERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government said President Barack Obama's pledge for new restrictions on mass surveillance by U.S. spy agencies so far offered ""no answer"" to Germany's concerns over spying.   The government in Berlin will ""look very closely"" at the consequences of Obama's speech addressing the matter, while talks between the two countries' intelligence officials continue, Merkel's chief spokesman told reporters Monday.  Mexican vigilantes not ready to give up arms   MEXICO CITY -- A leader of the vigilante groups in the Mexican state of Michoacan said Monday he was pleased with the progress federal forces are making in establishing order. But he added the groups are not ready to lay down their arms.   On Sunday, officials said they apprehended a leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel. But vigilante leader Hipolito Mora said the groups would not turn over their weapons until more are arrested.  Spacecraft sends signal after 31-month slumber   LONDON -- The comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft sent its first signal back to Earth after a 31-month hibernation on its decadelong mission into deep space.   Scientists at the European Space Agency's mission control in Darmstadt, Germany, jumped up and cheered when the signal registered, according to a webcast of the proceedings. It came during the agency's predicted 1-hour window and more than 8 hours after the craft's alarm clock woke it up.

3,420406596.xml,"         This always happens to President Bush.    He wants to talk about something light, such as his passion for mountain biking. But his presidential guest, or prime ministerial host, wants to talk about something serious, such as the U.S. detention of ""enemy combatants"" at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.    Tuesday, after a meeting in the Oval Office with Guy Verhofstadt, prime minister of Belgium and avid mountain biker, Bush told reporters: ""You're probably wondering what the prime minister is sharing with me. We're talking about mountain biking--actually, he's talking about the Tour de France. He's a huge advocate and a follower of the bike scene around the world.""    Sure, they spoke about bikes, Verhofstadt said. But the Belgian emphasized another part of their ""intense discussion"" as he stepped out to the chilly driveway of the West Wing, explaining a dim European view of the U.S.    ""There still is a negative image in the European public opinion, and it is due . . . to what's happening [at] Guantanamo,"" Verhofstadt told reporters. ""What the public opinion is asking and waiting for are that the suspects are put forth in trials.""    This was not the first time that a European leader had confronted Bush about the detention without trial at Guantanamo of prisoners the Bush administration has seized in its global war on terror.    Just last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel lodged her objections in a private meeting with the president. Bush responded publicly with a little self-effacing humor about the disputed 2000 election that put him in the White House.    Last summer Bush fielded a complaint about Guantanamo from Denmark's leader during a visit to the grand country estate of Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who celebrated Bush's 59th birthday but also served him a helping of criticism over the U.S. detentions.    Bush responded with bakery banter. ""I would strongly recommend the Danish birthday cake,"" the president said as he emerged from that session with Rasmussen in July.    For Bush, a little ice-breaking humor often serves as a way of defusing tension with his fellow world leaders.    And the ice can get pretty thick, as the president learned last winter in a marathon meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who displayed little patience for Bush's lectures about the need for democratic reforms in Russia. Bush emerged from that session in Slovakia intent on having some fun with his Russian counterpart.    ""I said, 'Vladimir, when we get in here, I think people are going to be very interested in this press conference, for some reason-- I'm not sure why,""' said a jocular Bush, standing alongside a grim- faced Putin in a hall of the medieval Bratislava Castle. ""Perhaps it's because you're a leader of a great nation and I'm fortunate to be one too. You can see we've drawn quite a crowd here.""    Putin wasn't laughing.    Nor did Putin much care for Bush's criticism of Russia's selection of regional leaders by its regional parliaments, as opposed to popular elections. Someone else was seated without a majority of the popular vote, Putin noted--that would be Bush, who won his first term with a narrow Electoral College victory even though he lost the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes.    ""This is, in essence, a system of the Electoral College, which is used on the national level in the United States,"" Putin said wryly, ""and it is not considered undemocratic, is it?""    Bush has a way of finding humor even in that contested 2000 election, which spawned 36 days of political turmoil over his disputed 537-vote margin in Florida before a Supreme Court ruling made him the winner.    Standing alongside Germany's Merkel in the East Room of the White House last week, Bush attempted to defuse their differences-- notably over the U.S. detentions at Guantanamo that Merkel had raised in their private meeting--by speaking of how much they have in common. Merkel became her nation's leader after a sharply divided election.    ""We share something in common,"" Bush said. ""We both didn't exactly landslide our way into office.""    Everyone laughed.    ----------    mdsilva@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: President Bush and Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt discuss mountain biking Tuesday at the White House.

4,1521903913.xml,"       Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Wednesday that he was  pulling Russian troops from the border with Ukraine and urging  pro-Russian separatists to delay a referendum on sovereignty that  they had hoped to hold Sunday. Putin claims he wants to give diplomacy a chance to resolve the  Ukrainian crisis that ... he had a huge hand in creating.   Did Putin blink because Russia's wobbly economy is seriously  threatened by economic sanctions that have been imposed by the U.S.  and Europe, sanctions that are focused on Russian business tycoons  and Putin cronies?   Or is Putin merely trying to give himself some diplomatic distance  while separatists in Ukraine continue to destabilize the country?  In that scenario, Putin would build some plausible deniability with  these latest maneuvers, then send Russian troops to ""stabilize""  Ukraine as chaos builds. Hey, he tried the diplomatic way first.  Didn't he smile on plans to hold a May 25 presidential election?   One reason to suspect a Putin feint is that Russia's major trading  partners in Europe -- the ones who could do serious damage to  Russia's economy and Putin's oligarch buddies -- have resisted  broader sanctions. Save Ukraine? Not if it means disrupting  business with Russia.   Many of Germany's business leaders have huge operations in Russia,  built over decades. They worry that harsh sanctions would cheat  them of a prime growth market as their domestic sales in Europe  stagnate.   So Putin may be calculating that a brief tactical retreat will slow  what little momentum there is on sanctions.   Putin should know that there's an economic cost to every inch of  Ukrainian territory, every building, every neighborhood that his  pro-Russian forces are tempted to overrun. That the cost of this  campaign will grow; that the U.S. and its allies won't flinch or  retreat, even though sanctions will cause domestic pain in Europe  as well.   If this is a tactical retreat, however brief, it should give the  U.S. and the EU members time to firm up their economic response to  Russia and get economic and military aid to Ukraine. Because when  this crisis ends, there will still be a Ukraine and it will still  face the need for economic reforms to sustain itself.   President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have  threatened harsher sanctions against Russia's major economic  industries if Moscow does not rein in pro-Russia forces in Ukraine.   Merkel needs to remind German industrial titans of what former  national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski recently told The  Wall Street Journal. ""What is at stake is a secure and open  Europe,"" he said. The alternative is ""some sort of a Russian  imperial enterprise next door, based largely on force, and as a  result probably quite unstable. So the stakes are really enormous.""   We'll soon see if Putin pulls troops back from the border, if  separatists abandon their plans for the May 11 referendum on  regional sovereignty, if Ukraine can peacefully elect a new  president on May 25.   That is, we'll soon see if Putin is has started a genuine retreat  from the crisis. No matter his tactics, it's unlikely he has  surrendered his desire to force Ukraine back into the Russian fold,  and away from any hopes of joining the EU or NATO.   Russian tanks may or may not roll into Kiev one day, the way Soviet  tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968. Many of  Europe's business and political leaders remember the triumphant  1989 toppling of the Berlin Wall. They cannot forget the decades of  struggle and sacrifice their peoples endured to make that Soviet  collapse happen. Europe can't pursue business as usual with Russia.  Not unless it wants to be responsible for losing Ukraine.

5,1679857902.xml,"       German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the Kremlin on Sunday to pay respects to the millions of Soviet lives lost in World War II and to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence with pro-Russia separatists to end the deadly conflict in Ukraine. But on the heels of a Western boycott of Russia's massive Victory Day parade on Saturday, Merkel's gesture appeared to do little to mend the rift that Moscow's actions in Ukraine have inflicted on relations between Russia and the U.S. and Europe.    Putin accompanied Merkel in laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, then hosted her in the Kremlin for talks that were clearly dominated by the two sides' stark differences over the legality of Russia's annexing of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last year.    At a brief news conference after their meeting, Putin appeared confident and unmoved by Merkel's argument that the seizure of Crimea was in violation of international law. He reiterated Moscow's claim that the predominantly Russian population had a right to vote for reunion with Russia after a ""coup d'etat"" in Kiev ousted the elected president in February 2014.    Merkel held her ground, urging Putin to use his influence with the separatists in eastern Ukraine to ""restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of the neighboring country where more than 6,100, many of them civilians, have been killed in little more than a year of fighting. The Kremlin leader agreed to do what he could but stated that the fate of Ukraine is in the hands of the separatists and the Kiev government, not Russia.    Both leaders pledged support for the Feb. 12 peace plan brokered in the Belarus capital of Minsk by Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and diplomats of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But they conceded that the cease-fire and artillery pullback agreed to in the Minsk pact haven't been honored by the combatants. Both described the diplomatic path out of the conflict as ""difficult"" but the only means of ending the bloodshed.    As Merkel and Putin talked, rebel leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic announced plans for a celebratory march in the eastern Ukraine city on Monday, the first anniversary of a dubious vote for independence held less than two months after Russia annexed Crimea. The march will be followed by a concert in the central Lenin Square of Donetsk, the Tass news agency reported, quoting the city's mayor.    The separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk, elected in November in unmonitored votes widely condemned as illegitimate, have declined to conform with the Minsk peace plan call for new local elections. Nor has the government in Kiev made any progress in adopting the constitutional changes called for by the accord to grant broader autonomy to the eastern regions where the Russian language is dominant but no longer accorded official status.    The meeting with Merkel was the last in a four-day whirlwind of diplomacy as Putin received many of the visiting heads of state and government who attended the Red Square parade, including the presidents of China, India, South Africa, Cuba, Serbia and a handful of former Soviet republics.    Putin brushed off the absence of the U.S. and Western European leaders, remarking before TV cameras Saturday night that ""everyone we wanted to see was here.""    He also told Czech President Milos Zeman, one of the few top European leaders to attend the parade, that the relationship trouble with the West wasn't the fault of the Kremlin.    ""It was not us who initiated the chill in relations with Europe, but I hope that thanks to politicians like you we will manage not only to revive them completely but to also move forward,"" Putin told Zeman on Saturday.    ----------   carol.williams@tribpub.com Credit: By Carol J.

6,1468091316.xml,"       Snowden doc: NSA can easily tap cellphone calls WASHINGTON -- The cellphone encryption technology used most widely  across the world can be easily defeated by the National Security  Agency, an internal document shows, giving the agency the means to  decode most of the billions of calls and texts that travel over  public airwaves every day.   While the military and law enforcement agencies long have been able  to hack into individual cellphones, the NSA's capability appears to  be far more sweeping because of the agency's global signals  collection operation. The agency's ability to crack encryption used  by the majority of cellphones in the world offers it wide-ranging  powers to listen in on private conversations.   U.S. law prohibits the NSA from collecting the content of  conversations between Americans without a court order. But experts  say that if the NSA has developed the capacity to easily decode  encrypted cellphone conversations, then other nations likely can do  the same, potentially listening to Americans' calls.   Encryption experts have complained for years that the most commonly  used technology is vulnerable and have urged providers to upgrade  to newer systems that are much harder to crack. Most companies  worldwide have not done so, even as controversy has intensified  recently over NSA collection of cellphone traffic, including of  such leaders as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   The extent of the NSA's collection of cellphone signals and its use  of tools to decode encryption are not clear from a top-secret  document provided by former contractor Edward Snowden.

7,2559989794.xml,"ALGIERS, Algeria -- At least 25 Algerian soldiers were killed saving residents from wildfires ravaging mountain forests and villages east of the capital, the president announced Tuesday night as the civilian death toll from the blazes rose to at least 17.  President Abdelmadjid Tebboune tweeted that the soldiers saved 100 people from the fires in two areas of Kabyle, the region that is home to the North African nation's Berber population. Eleven other soldiers were burned fighting the fires, four of them seriously, the Defense Ministry said.Prime Minister Aïmene Benabderrahmane later said on state TV that 17 civilians had lost their lives, raising the count of citizens from seven previously and bringing the total death toll to 42. He provided no details.The Kabyle region, 60 miles east of Algeria's capital of Algiers, is dotted with difficult-to-access villages and with temperatures rising has had limited water.Some villagers were fleeing, while others tried to hold back the flames themselves, using buckets, branches and rudimentary tools.The region has no water-dumping planes.The deaths and injuries Tuesday occurred around Kabyle's capital of Tizi-Ouzou, which is flanked by mountains, and in Bejaia, which borders the Mediterranean Sea, the president said.The prime minister told state television that initial reports from security services showed the fires in Kabyle were ""highly synchronized,"" adding that ""leads one to believe these were criminal acts."" Earlier, Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud traveled to Kabyle to assess the situation and also blamed the fires there on arson.""Thirty fires at the same time in the same region can't be by chance,"" Beldjoud said on national television, although no arrests were announced.Twitter suspends Rep.

The company issued her third strike less than a month ago.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's current guidance states, ""Covid-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick.""Prince Andrew sued by Epstein accuser: One of Jeffrey Epstein's longtime accusers sued Prince Andrew on Monday, taking accusations that she has repeatedly publicly lodged against him, including that he sexually assaulted her when she was 17, to a formal venue.Lawyers for Virginia Giuffre filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, where Epstein was charged criminally with sex trafficking a month before he killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 in an adjacent federal jail where he was ordered to await trial.Giuffre has repeatedly made her allegations against Epstein, his onetime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and Andrew, but the lawsuit was the first time she has directly confronted Andrew in such a formal setting. It steps up public relations pressure on the prince, even if he remains beyond the reach of the courts.The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified monetary and punitive damages, was brought under the Child Victims Act, a 2019 New York state law that allows victims to temporarily make legal claims of abuse that occurred when they were children regardless of when or how long ago the alleged abuse occurred.Ethiopia issues call to war: Ethiopia's government on Tuesday summoned all capable citizens to war, urging them to join the country's military to stop resurgent forces from the embattled Tigray region ""once and for all.""The call to arms is an ominous sign that all of Ethiopia's 110 million people are being drawn into a conflict that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, once declared would be over within weeks. The deadly fighting has now spread beyond Tigray into neighboring regions, and fracturing in Africa's second most populous country could destabilize the entire Horn of Africa region.Tuesday's announcement effectively ends the unilateral cease-fire the government declared in June as its military retreated from Tigray.It is also almost certain to magnify the toll of a nine-month war that has led to the massacre of thousands, widespread gang rapes and the displacement of entire communities, mostly Tigrayan. Hundreds of thousands of people in Tigray now face famine conditions in the world's worst hunger crisis in a decade.Germany to end free virus tests: Germany is ending free coronavirus tests for its citizens beginning in October, in part to encourage more people to get vaccinated, officials said Tuesday.Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany now has enough vaccines for its whole population -- more than half is already fully immunized -- and that studies showed they are effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19, including from infections with the delta variant.""The not-so-good news is that the speed of vaccination has declined significantly,"" Merkel said after a Tuesday meeting with the country's 16 state governors.Merkel said the government hopes 75% of the population will get the shot, but so far only slightly over 55% are fully immunized. She urged Germans who are already vaccinated to encourage others to do so too.Wisconsin governor vetoes voting restrictions: Wisconsin Gov.

Evers' veto came as Republicans in Texas moved closer to mustering a quorum to pass voting changes stymied by Democrats fleeing the state.Wisconsin Republicans don't have enough votes to override Evers' veto.CAPTION: Photo: Water rescue: A woman climbs out of a pickup truck as Northwest Fire District fire fighters position themselves for a water rescue in the Canada del Oro Wash north of Tucson, Ariz., on Tuesday.

From poor security at the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, to the revelation of eavesdropping on close allies to the botched rollout of online insurance marketplaces -- a key component of his landmark health care law -- Obama increasingly is battling accusations of top-level management failures as much as policy or political problems.    On each of these controversies, the president has claimed ignorance before the fact and outrage afterward, leaving even some Democrats to see him as asleep at the wheel.    ""There's a sort of distance in his style,"" said Elaine Kamarck, who led the Clinton administration's government reform effort and now is at the Brookings Institution.    ""On the one hand, he's not getting into terrible details like (President Jimmy) Carter did,"" she said. ""But on the other hand, it comes back to bite him because he seems to not know a lot of stuff that's going on.""    In public opinion surveys, Obama's job performance ratings have dropped sharply this year. One recent poll showed his approval at 42 percent, a rate comparable to President George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.    While unpredictable crises often upend presidents' second terms, some of Obama's worst problems seem self-inflicted.    The iPad-toting president who promised high-tech efficiency in government -- even appointing the first chief performance officer, chief technology officer and team of innovation fellows at the White House -- has launched his signature domestic program with a website that seems a relic from the dial-up age.    ""They had a tech-savvy campaign, but that has very little to do with running a tech-savvy government, because the presidency really doesn't run in a management way,"" said former chief of staff William Daley.    ""The one kind of surprising thing, since this was the signature (domestic program) and for four years everybody knew this was a complicated difficult thing to do, is that there wasn't a heavier kind of skepticism around the process.""    As a candidate, Obama vowed to restore government competence to earn back the public trust and to make a case for expanding the government's role in people's lives.    But Obama did not sustain the zeal for good management, Kamarck said. He hardly discussed his attempt to scale back outside contracting, for example, disappointing those who called for reform.    Inconsistency at the top is part of the problem, said Bob Stone, project director of the Clinton-era government reform effort, which was headed by then-Vice President Al Gore. Gore devoted time every day to the project and stayed in contact with agency heads.    In one of those meetings, during the government shutdown in the mid-1990s, Gore learned the Justice Department had furloughed key staff, leaving no one to order food at federal prisons. The problem was fixed on the spot, Stone said.    ""It seems to be that this White House has no chain to the top, even just the conventional 'protect the boss' standard that ought to be in place everywhere,"" Stone said. He added, ""It's hard to see that the president has really had any interest in actually managing the government.""    White House spokesman Jay Carney disputed that characterization Friday.    When it comes to U.S. eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Carney said the president is a ""deliberate consumer of the intelligence gathered for him."" But he said Obama was focused on security threats that ""keep him up at night,"" not a close ally's phone calls.    On the health care website rollout, Carney maintained the president did not know the website wasn't fully functional before it was launched Oct. 1.    ""The president expects results,"" Carney said. ""That's the way he manages this administration. He believes that smart people ought to bring all their talents to bear to solving problems, but he expects results.""    Past presidents have also learned the hard way that the mundane work of management can prove crucial.    Bush's popularity never recovered from his slow response to Katrina's devastation on the Gulf Coast. Carter's re-election in 1980 was doomed by his handling of the Iran hostage crisis, when militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 American diplomats for 444 days.    ""In both those cases, management issues became the point of no return,"" Kamarck said.    ----------   khennessey@tribune.com Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey and Christi Parsons, Tribune Washington Bureau Caption: Photo: When Barack Obama was elected president, he added a group of innovation-related aides, including Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, left.

9,1035503501.xml,"       A month of key meetings related to the economic future of the U.S. and Europe are lined up for September, starting days after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke closes out August with a speech at an annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. European meetings will focus on whether countries such as Germany will support bailouts of troubled countries, the strings that will be attached and the mechanisms that will be used. Eyes also will be on the Fed and whether its policymakers will call for more stimulus.   Here's a look at upcoming events:   * Sept. 6: European Central Bank meeting, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel holds talks with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Spain's need for additional help.   * Sept. 12: Dutch elections, with the outcome possibly determining whether the country stays in the eurozone.   * Sept. 12: Germany's Constitutional Court determines whether it's legal for Germany to participate in eurozone bailouts through the essential European Stability Mechanism (ESM) fund.   * Sept. 13: The Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee meets, and many observers are expecting an announcement of a third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing.   * Sept. 14-15: European financial ministers meet through the euro group, consider aid through the ESM, setting up a new European bank supervisor and Greece assistance.

10,2425638952.xml,"After nearly five days of intense haggling, European Union leaders on Tuesday stepped up to confront one of the gravest challenges in the bloc’s history and agreed to a landmark spending package to rescue their economies from the ravages of the pandemic.
The 750 billion euro ($857 billion) stimulus agreement, spearheaded by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, sent a strong signal of solidarity even as it exposed deep new fault lines in a bloc reshaped by the British exit.
The deal was notable for its firsts: European countries will raise large sums by selling bonds collectively, rather than individually; and much of that money will be handed out to member nations hardest hit by the pandemic as grants that do not have to be repaid, and not as loans that would swell their national debts.
Those extraordinary steps reflected a difficult consensus arrived at by members that the scale of crisis facing them required groundbreaking measures to ensure the bloc’s legitimacy, stability and prosperity. But the lengthy negotiations in Brussels were notable, too, for their exceptional rancor — and it was clear that the pooling of resources and sovereignty had come at a cost.
A strange kind of political theater, never visited upon EU summits before, marked the meeting — with leaders donning masks and bumping elbows to greet. They were safely spaced in a vast hall, their entourages trimmed to only the most essential members.
When they convened on Friday, it was their first in-person summit in the five months since the coronavirus took hold in Europe. The meeting was officially scheduled to last until Saturday. By Monday morning, exhausted and angry after bargaining all night, they were still tussling over the details. The start of Monday’s session was twice delayed, and then it spilled into Tuesday morning.
As negotiations broke down over the weekend, so did many precautions the leaders and their teams had taken to protect themselves from the virus, which in most of Europe has been brought down to manageable levels, in any case. As the hours wore on and the talks grew heated, the diplomatic gloves came off, and so did the masks. Breakout groups met in rooms far smaller and less ventilated than the 300-seat auditorium where the general meeting was convened.
While there is no underestimating the importance of the agreement — the generosity of its size and the novelty of its mechanisms — the acrimony and dramatics of the four-day meeting betrayed the new divisions within the bloc. They also signaled where the fractures may lie in future crises.
The talks were defined by shifting roles among members now jostling to make their voices heard and for leadership in the absence of Britain, which had often played the part of the thrifty contrarian, fastidious about rules, in past summits.
This time, Merkel, unusually for a German leader, and holding the EU’s rotating presidency, put her finger on the scale on behalf of hard-hit southern countries and did battle with the nations she once championed, the northern members that have been less affected by the virus and are wary of the vast sums being thrown around.
Where Friday’s meeting was marked by joyful greetings and even celebrations of the birthdays of two leaders — Merkel, now 66, and Prime Minister Antonio Costa of Portugal, who turned 59 — Sunday night’s dinner (a “cold dish” after several sumptuous meals, socially spaced but unmasked) was marked by shouting matches and a nasty atmosphere.
Macron, for example, yelled at Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria for not only being a tightfisted impediment to the rescue deal but also for leaving the room to take a call. To some leaders’ shock, the French president slapped the table. Kurz tried to keep his cool, and in a zinger put Macron’s temper tantrum down to sleep deprivation, diplomats said.
As talks broke up without a deal around 6 a.m. Monday, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told his country’s media that he didn’t care if other leaders mockingly called him “Mr. No” for blocking the agreement. (They did.)
It was Rutte who stepped into the vacuum left by Germany’s shift and Britain’s departure to lead the so-called Frugal Four, which include his nation as well as Austria, Sweden and Denmark. Occasionally, the “frugals” became five with the support of Finland.
In the end, with a unanimous decision by the 27 nations needed for a plan to go forward, a bitter compromise prevailed. The ambitious plan pushed by Merkel and Macron was watered down, but remained significant. The overall figure of 750 billion euros remained, but an original proposal to offer 500 billion euros of that in the form of grants was trimmed back to 390 billion euros, with 360 billion euros earmarked for loans.
In addition to raising cash and extending grants, the package will increase lending and deploy other, more traditional stimulus methods to arrest and reverse the economic free-fall that threatens the stability of the world’s richest bloc of nations.
Economists predict a recession far worse than anything since World War II. France, Italy and Spain, the bloc’s second-, third- and fourth-largest economies, are expected to suffer the most, clocking in contractions of around 10% this year.
Greece and other smaller economies that are still recovering from the last recession will also be badly affected by the downturn. But heavy debt loads in many of these nations make them reluctant to amass yet more debt, and their budgets aren’t sufficient to self-fund their recoveries. That led them to turn to the EU for help.
Together with the vast bond-buying program by the European Central Bank, national stimulus plans worth trillions of euros, and other, smaller EU support schemes for banks, businesses and workers, European leaders hope to reverse the recession in 2021 and spend their way into a rapid and powerful recovery.
They also agreed on Tuesday on the bloc’s regular budget for the next seven years: 1.1 trillion euros to finance the normal EU policies on agriculture, migration and hundreds of other programs.
But the deal came at a heavy price in progressive goals attached to EU values and norms. To bring Hungary and Poland on board, EU leaders decided to water down the caveat making funding conditional on the rule-of-law benchmarks that the two nations’ illiberal governments are violating.
In another concession to Poland, the bloc’s most coal-dependent nation, a requirement was dropped that would have committed the country to being carbon neutral by 2050 to draw on parts of the funds.
Since its inception, the EU has struggled between maintaining nation-state sovereignty and developing joint federal-style structures.
The deal reached on Tuesday is significant in that more creditworthy EU nations will be underwriting loans to fund the recoveries of countries that would otherwise face onerous borrowing costs.
The Netherlands and Austria were hostile to the very idea of borrowing money and simply giving much of it to benefit mostly southern, weaker economies.
Under significant pressure at home as elections approach next March, the Dutch prime minister, Rutte, advocated loudly for fewer handouts to those nations, among them Italy and Spain, that have been hardest hit by the pandemic but that also have structurally weak, unreformed economies.
The Netherlands and other wealthier nations with healthier public finances are concerned that the commonly funded aid would simply go into a bottomless pit of spending that doesn’t truly help these economies recover without changes to make it easier to reduce bureaucracy, create jobs and stimulate growth.
A key argument in favor of offering grants rather than loans has been that Italy and other countries likely to take the aid are already overindebted, and piling on yet more loans would just worsen their positions.
Rutte fought successfully for bigger-than-usual rebates, or reimbursements, for his own and other nations that are net contributors to the EU budget.
He and the others succeeded in wringing out another concession: Any country that wishes to use the new funds will need to submit a plan for how it intends to spend the money. The other EU nations will have a chance to review and object to the plan within three days of its submission and demand that it be tweaked.
Still, that mechanism fell short of the outright veto that Rutte had demanded, which the Italian and Spanish leaders denounced as an unacceptable encroachment into their authority.
The package will go to the European Parliament for ratification, and is expected to face a serious challenge on the grounds that it does not tackle concerns about how Poland and Hungary’s governments violate the bloc’s standards for democracy and the rule of law.

11,1399908002.xml,"       China's growth slows to 7.5% in 2nd quarter BEIJING -- Falling exports and tighter credit cooled China's growth in the second quarter to 7.5 percent from a year earlier, officials said Monday. Growth in the first quarter was 7.7 percent, and many analysts predict the nation's gross domestic product will expand 7.5 percent -- or less -- for the year.   Although that's a blistering pace compared with those of the U.S. and many other Western nations, it would be a drop from China's 7.8 percent rate last year and the country's slowest growth since 1990 after nearly two decades of double-digit annual expansion.   Although some of the deceleration is linked to global economic factors -- such as continued weakness in Europe and the prospect of tighter monetary policy in the U.S. -- a portion seems to be the result of deliberate policy choices by the Chinese leaders who took office this spring.   In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Chinese authorities unleashed a flood of stimulus to keep the economy going while the rest of the world slowed, and they kept the spigots on until this year. But much of the cheap money ended up circulating in financial markets or being plowed into real estate ventures and infrastructure projects rather than being used to expand and improve businesses.   Now, with concerns about bad loans mounting and growth slowing, President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and other top officials are signaling it's time to shift gears.   The officials want to cut off stimulus, reduce debt and press new policies to reform and open the economy.  Many at Guantanamo quit monthslong hunger strike   Twenty-five Guantanamo Bay prisoners have quit their hunger strike during Ramadan, according to the U.S. military, which reported Sunday that Navy medical staff still considered 45 captives sufficiently malnourished to require forced feeding.   Prison spokesmen suggested they had broken part of the protest with a new policy: Captives had to abandon their hunger strike to live in communal detention -- where they can pray and eat in groups -- after months alone in maximum-security lockdown.  Airlines confident of Dreamliner's safety   LONDON -- Airlines expressed confidence in the safety of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner on Sunday as investigators searched for the cause of a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines jet Friday at Heathrow Airport.   British officials said initial checks into what they called a serious incident appeared to rule out any link to the battery-related problems that grounded the Dreamliner fleet earlier this year.  Lawmaker wants more done to get Snowden   WASHINGTON -- A key congressional Republican said Sunday that the Obama administration must step up efforts and exert ""any and all pressure"" on Russia to get Moscow to hand over former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.   ""I'm sure Russia loves this,"" Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said of the Snowden drama. The U.S. has asked Russia to return Snowden.  Merkel offers assurance against U.S. surveillance   BERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed Sunday to push for tougher EU data protection rules and force Internet firms to be more open as she tried to reassure voters before a September election about intrusive snooping by U.S. intelligence in Germany.   In an interview, she also said she expected the U.S. to stick to German laws in the future, the closest she has come to acknowledging that its spying techniques may have breached German rules.

13,1733011544.xml,"       A Syrian passport found by the body of a suicide bomber in the  bloody aftermath of Friday's terror attacks in Paris has fueled  anti-migrant sentiment in Europe and confronted the tide of  refugees fleeing war with new obstacles and suspicion. Whether the passport reportedly recorded by migration officials on  the Greek island of Leros more than a month earlier was that of a  terrorist infiltrator or one of the thousands of counterfeits sold  on black markets is unknown.  But the document raised the possibility that Islamic State  militants have made good on their threat to enter and attack Europe  from within the wave of Syrian refugees.  That was enough to spur calls Saturday for closing borders to the  displaced, many of them having fled their homelands to escape the  scourge of Islamic State extremists. Since summer, more than a  million migrants have flooded the continent from Scandinavia to the  Balkans.  As the death and injury tolls from the carnage claimed by Islamic  State were still being tallied, France's far-right National Front  leader Marine Le Pen was calling for French citizens to ""take back  control"" of their borders and ""annihilate Islamist fundamentalism.""  In Germany, the leader of the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany  lobby that has criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of  the migration crisis, took to Twitter to boast that appeals coming  from Merkel's own political partners in the state of Bavaria to  seal borders and require passports were tantamount to  ""advertisement"" for the group's policies.  Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders urged the government to close  the Netherlands' borders immediately, saying the leadership of  Prime Minister Mark Rutte had been ""turning away and denying"" the  obvious perils to the Dutch citizenry from the poorly controlled  Middle East migrants.  Merkel has been the target of criticism and protest for months for  having welcomed an estimated 1 million migrants into Germany this  year.  But the Paris attacks that killed more than 125 people were being  presented by right-wing groups as proof that her open-door policy  exposes Germany to anger over Western airstrikes aimed at wiping  out Islamic State.  ""In light of the increased migration to Germany, we have to know  who is driving through our country,"" said Bavarian state governor  Horst Seehofer, a political colleague critical of Merkel's opening  of German borders to the migrants, many of whom lack proper  documentation.  ""The Paris attacks have changed everything,"" tweeted Markus Soeder,  Bavarian state finance minister and, like Seehofer, a member of  Merkel's sister party, the Christian Social Union. ""We cannot allow  illegal and uncontrolled border crossing to continue.""  German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere warned against equating  the latest terror attack in Europe with the peaceful migrants for  whom Europeans should be welcoming and supportive.  ""I'd like to appeal urgently that no one rush to make a connection  with the refugee situation,"" de Maiziere told reporters in Berlin.  ""How we deal with the refugee crisis shouldn't be linked in any way  to how we deal with terrorism.""  Eastern European states have been among the most resistant in  Europe to the tide of Muslims seeking to escape conflict and  poverty.  In Warsaw, where a conservative majority is set to take power  Monday following last month's parliamentary election, the incoming  minister for European affairs said Poland would scrap its agreement  with other European Union states to take larger numbers of the  migrants.  ""In the face of the tragic acts in Paris, we do not see the  political possibilities to implement (the migrant resettlement  plan),"" Konrad Szymanski of the incoming Law and Justice Party told  the right-leaning wPolityce.pl news site.  ""We have been saying that there are enormous security risks linked  to migration. Hopefully, some people will open their eyes now,""  Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico told journalists in Bratislava  after convening an emergency meeting of security officials.  In Hungary, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia the burdens  imposed on security and humanitarian relief agencies by the flow of  hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees making their way  north have created new social divisions and discord.  Even in the more welcoming countries of central and northern  Europe, a public backlash is intensifying as citizens despair over  the mounting social disruption.  As their southern flanks have proven the most accessible entrances  to the European Union, Greece and Italy have seen the majority of  migrants flow into the prosperous alliance through their  Mediterranean Sea islands and ports.  Most of the refugees and migrants, though, have had their sights  set on Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, where  governments provide more aid and transition to new lives.  But the ad hoc system that has developed in recent months, with the  southern EU states allowing the refugees free passage to travel  onward, may be under new threat as the governments controlling the  points of entry reconsider their roles.  In Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met with security and  intelligence officials to ponder tightening of the precautions  against terrorist infiltration.  But the Paris attacks appeared to empower the right-wing Northern  League in its demands for closing the door to Muslim refugees.  ---------- carol.williams@tribpub.com Credit: By Carol J.

14,1446240866.xml,"       In the European Union, Germans have shrugged off their postwar  reserve and make no apology for shaping Europe's future, taking key  posts in EU institutions and pushing Berlin's trade interests with  vigor. As Angela Merkel forms a new coalition government after a third  successive election triumph, the conservative chancellor can build  on efforts, underway since her first term in 2005, that have  increased not just the number of Germans in senior jobs in  Brussels, but the extent to which they answer to Berlin.   And where that fails to ensure EU policy acceptable to the union's  biggest economy, Merkel has shown she is prepared to lay down the  law in person -- as when she demanded retreat this summer from a  looming trade war with China that would have hurt the exports of  Germany's big carmakers and engineering firms.   Its 27 partners can hardly deny that a state that is home to 1 EU  citizen in 6 and produces one-fifth of its output must have a big  say. But Berlin's new assertiveness, aided by a widening economic  gap that it has opened up over struggling allies, is provoking  grumbles.   For Germans like Herbert Reul, who leads the chancellor's Christian  Democrats in the European Parliament, that influence is a natural  development of history for a nation that long put its wealth at the  service of a French-accented EU in return for the political  rehabilitation that brought after Adolf Hitler.   ""We're done with that,"" Reul said of the days of German reserve in  Brussels, which endured through the long leadership of Helmut Kohl  that saw the forging in the 1990s of the euro and of a bigger  Germany that absorbed the formerly communist east.   ""A state that wasn't a state, always a bit under the authority of  the Allies ... is very cautious,"" Reul added. ""To take  responsibility means that you shouldn't just be sitting in the  corner and apologizing -- that's not enough.""   Taking responsibility has meant, among other things, taking some of  the most powerful, if not always the most visible, jobs in  Brussels.   Uwe Corsepius is hardly a household name. But alongside a few dozen  other senior Germans, he holds great sway over EU policy.   Corsepius, 53, once Merkel's Europe adviser, is secretary-general  of the European Council. Some of his 3,000 staff see him as the man  who cut their access to Facebook and travel websites to make them  work harder. But his real power is to steer the agendas and legal  advice that shape meetings of EU governments.   ""Germans are behaving more normally in relation to Brussels,"" said  Hans-Gert Poettering, who was European Parliament speaker until  2009. ""This does not mean that this wartime chapter in our history  is closed. But history should not restrict our freedom to act.""   Coordination among Germans in Brussels and between them and Berlin  is no accident. Kohl used to complain that fellow Germans tended to  abandon their national identity once across the border.   Now, said Reul: ""If we speak with one voice, then we have power.""   ""The German group seeks to represent industrial political  interests. We have a lot of industry to defend,"" said Reul, who  represents a manufacturing region on the lower Rhine.   Simon Hix, professor of European politics at The London School of  Economics, said: ""You feel the shadow of the Berlin government in  the Parliament. ... It's rare that anything happens ... that's  against the interests of German industry.""   Merkel's intervention in this year's trade row with China regarding  solar panels illustrated Berlin's clout.   As the European Commission prepared to impose sanctions on Beijing  for its alleged dumping of cheap panels in EU markets, Chinese  Premier Li Keqiang flew to Berlin to warn of a trade war that would  hurt the German car industry.   Telling the German public she would do all she could to stop a war  that would damage German exports, Merkel picked up the phone to  call commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels. Germany,  bankroller of eurozone bailouts and the biggest net contributor to  the EU budget, would not risk wrecking ties with a country that  buys $50 billion a year of machinery, from Porsches to tanks and  other equipment.   Europe stepped back, and the dispute was resolved by setting a  minimum price on Chinese solar panels.   If Germans are pleased, among neighbors still wary after a century  of viewing Berlin as a menace there is irritation at a tendency to  talk down to those less economically successful.   ""Germany says, 'We are doing best, so we are the best,' "" said  Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a veteran of politics in Germany and France and  co-chair of the Greens group in the EU parliament.   ""This can have negative repercussions. By taking this approach,  Germany is putting the brakes on Europe.""   For Cohn-Bendit, born in France after his Jewish parents fled Nazi  Germany, Berlin's focus on its export-driven economy was blunting a  broader EU ambition for wide global influence.   ""The German approach is that they don't want to be bothered with  the world,"" he said. ""National economic interests is the limit of  their thinking. It wants to have economic leadership and, in  foreign policy, to be like Luxembourg.""

15,1628200340.xml,"       The verdant fields, once covered with bustling farms, are now only dotted with them. Factories pop up every few miles, but mostly as faded husks of their 20th-century selves. Thuringia has the decided feel of a state lagging behind in the economic powerhouse that is modern Germany. On the serene streets of Erfurt, the state capital, many people are worn out. They are fatigued by a quarter-century of rule under Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union; by an economy that, with an unemployment rate higher and wages lower than national averages, never seems to live up to its promise; by their nation's involvement for more than a decade in faraway conflicts that seem very removed from these sleepy Central European precincts.  ""They're tired of what people in the other parties are telling them,"" politician Bodo Ramelow said. ""They want a change.""  Ramelow, 58, aims to be the one leading the revolution. The former union leader heads the Thuringian wing of the Left Party, which espouses nationalizing banks, reining in hedge funds and dissolving NATO. Next month, the Left will become the first radical socialist party to run an eastern state since the hated Socialist Union Party, or SED, ruled East Germany during the Cold War.  The Left garnered a startling 28 percent of the vote during state elections in September, a close second to Merkel's long-powerful CDU and well ahead of more moderate left-wing alternatives like the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party. A savvy operator, Ramelow then wooed the Social Democrats and Greens to join a coalition that the Left will lead.  The specter of a far-left comeback, even in this comparatively small state, has sent ripples through the German political system and provoked those who bitterly recall East Germany and the Cold War.  ""The CDU has run this place for a long time, and what did it get us?"" said Axl Schroeder, a restaurant manager in Erfurt, about 150 miles southwest of Berlin. ""It's time for the Left to get a chance.""  Such talk is popular in a place that supporters hope will become a lab experiment for elevating radical leftist politics on a national scale. With 12 percent of the 631 seats in the Bundestag, or national parliament, the Left is now Germany's third-biggest party and, under charismatic legislative leader Gregor Gysi, the largest in the opposition. If the Left can prove effective in Thuringia, supporters foresee victories in other states and nationally.  The party has found supporters not just among dyed-in-the-wool easterners but among the country's 4 million immigrants, old West German lefties and disenchanted voters across a variety of backgrounds. They say capitalism and European Union-centric policies have not worked. Many of them oppose the nation's involvement in NATO and the conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya.  But such ideas are offensive to many who fought against the East German police state.  President Joachim Gauck, a former East German dissident, has stepped out of his ceremonial role in recent weeks to rail against the Left's surge, saying he found it ""unconscionable.""  On the genealogy chart of German political parties, the Left is descended from the SED: It merges the party's successor organization with another socialist faction. Though leaders say it contains no power brokers in key positions from the communist era, critics say that is a distinction without a difference.  Supporters say German unification has brought easterners diminished factories, eroded state-run industries such as coal mining and, perhaps more important, eradicated a sense of national identity.  ""People don't understand there's a depression that afflicts those who lived in the east and saw their lives ruined by capitalism,"" said Benjamin Immanuel-Hoff, a former state secretary for the Left in Thuringia who advises Ramelow.  Trading on this grievance is a fine line for the Left. The party must play on nostalgia without suggesting it wishes to return to the modest economy or sweeping government oversight of the communist era.  Ramelow says his is a modern and open socialism. But he also speaks of including former Stasi secret police members in the political process.  ""There were 179,000 informants. Where did they go?"" he asked. ""They're still here. And they need to be part of the transformation.""  He said opponents' fear of a return to a Soviet-era Russian alignment is unfounded.  The emergence of the Left is a sign of generally more polarized politics in Europe. It coincides with the rise of the far-right National Front in France, which won 25 percent of the vote in European elections in May.  ---------- szeitchik@tribpub.com Credit: By Steven Zeitchik, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: Gregor Gysi leads the radical socialist Left Party, which is now Germany's third-biggest party.

16,926258104.xml,"      Mayor Rahm Emanuel was on the phone Monday evening to declare victory, just hours after President Barack Obama pulled the Group of Eight summit -- and all the chaos it would bring -- out of Chicago. Obama now wants to host the G-8 in the relative seclusion of Camp David in rural Maryland, rather than under a media spotlight in Chicago. The NATO summit is still scheduled for Chicago in May. But that shouldn't bring the same kind of heat and light.  ""It's a win-win situation,"" Mayor Emanuel told me over the phone. ""Chicago gets to host all the heads of state at the NATO summit. And the president hosts the G-8 meetings at Camp David, which is essential for the kind of environment he wants.""  Isn't it a setback to lose the G-8?  ""We're still going to show Chicago to the world and the world to Chicago,"" Emanuel said. ""And the Group of 8 heads of state will also come to Chicago,"" he said, rattling them off faster than I could type. ""German Chancellor (Angela) Merkel is still coming to Chicago, and the French President (Nicolas) Sarkozy and the Italian prime minister ...""  Emanuel's comments ran parallel with those of the White House, in that Chicago still gets at least one summit, the NATO meeting, and Obama hosts the G-8 in a more conducive setting.  ""Camp David is a more intimate setting,"" Emanuel said. ""And the president wants to deal with the G-8 leaders in that kind of atmosphere, and we get to showcase Chicago.""  Fair enough. Everybody wins. Obama, Emanuel, even the Occupy Chicago folks, though they won't be able to send throngs of thousands to the secluded and fortresslike Camp David.  But Occupy also claimed victory Monday, and why not? The group said Obama's decision is a signal that it was successful in their protests against its enemies, the so-called fat-cat business leaders.  While protesters still aim to antagonize the Chicago establishment at the NATO summit, many of the recent demonstrations here have been driven by organized labor. Getting their members revved up to hurl insults and shriek at merchant bankers is one thing. But getting a mass protest to rip on heads of state who are establishing a timeline to pull the troops out of Afghanistan is another matter.  Withdrawal has long been a goal of the political left. NATO would be doing what they want -- getting the troops out.  So, while there may be protests during the NATO summit, the fact is that the White House has let at least some air (and pressure) out of the balloon.  Despite the well-orchestrated spinning by Emanuel and the White House that it's a ""win-win"" for everybody, the move seemed abrupt. Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy had just been interviewed by the Tribune about his preparations for the G-8/NATO summits, expressing confidence. Other political bureaucrats had been trotted out to play talking heads as well.  You don't send them out there if you think the White House is going to yank the chain.  Politically, the G-8 summit protests promised to provide great theater and give Obama's critics plenty of ammunition as his re-election campaign took shape.  And with the White House talking about tolerance while pushing class warfare, the last thing the president needs is images of protesters clashing with Chicago police, with the Occupy movement camped in squalid Obamavilles in the parks.  It would have been a powerful metaphor, Americans huddled around campfires outside plywood huts in some photogenic tent city, cooking potatoes speared on sticks in Obama's political hometown.  Now, I don't want to brag about influencing world events, but in a recent column I begged Obama and Emanuel to cancel both summits and reschedule them for the isolated wilds of Colorado, in the tiny burg of Lake City, population 400, one of the most isolated places in the continental U.S.  Chicagoans don't want either summit. And even on Monday, little Lake City was eager to help us by taking the world leaders in for a few days to give Chicago a break.  Lake City resident Harvey DuChene, 68, a geologist, created a list of which of his friends and relatives would put up various heads of state and political figures in their homes.  ""We can only put up heads of state. No staff. No Secret Service. None of that. All of them will have to stay at campgrounds about 20 minutes out of town.""  Who's Obama staying with?  ""Most people in Lake City are conservative, so it would be more difficult to find a place for him.""  DuChene said he and his wife offered their hospitality to Canadian dignitaries. ""My wife and I speak fluent Canadian, so it would be appropriate.""  We asked if he could email us the list, but he said that was impossible. It's classified.  ""No,"" DuChene said. ""The Secret Service might not like that.""  Kelli Robinson, assistant director of the Lake City/Hinsdale County Chamber of Commerce, said the summits would be just in time for the school marathon. The dignitaries could run.  Her dad, Steve Robinson, offered to open his home up as well.  ""I'm sure if they wanted to come to Lake City we could put somebody up here. We have extra bedrooms.""  And he doesn't think protesters would bother anyone.  ""There's one road in and one road out,"" he said. ""So it would be pretty hard for them to get here.""  But still easier than getting to Camp David.  ---------- jskass@tribune.com Caption: Photo: The abrupt move of the G-8 summit from Chicago is ""a win-win situation,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel says.

17,1220559107.xml,"       Now here's an economic stimulus program that every American has  good reason to support: After a decade of posturing, U.S. and  European Union negotiators are getting serious about a free-trade  agreement. It would give a welcome boost to sluggish economies on  both sides of the Atlantic -- and it wouldn't cost taxpayers a  cent. Officials say formal trade talks could begin as soon as next  spring. They can't start soon enough as far as we're concerned. The  goal should be a comprehensive deal akin to the North American Free  Trade Agreement. It should once and for all eliminate the tariffs  and other barriers that put an unnecessary drag on doing business  between the U.S. and the 27 EU-member states.   Momentum started to build after President Barack Obama's  re-election. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime  Minister David Cameron reportedly pushed the idea of launching  formal trade talks even as they offered congratulations. Business  groups and companies with trans-Atlantic operations have pushed  hard too. Even some labor leaders have given a green light.   Moreover, Canada is close to inking a free-trade agreement with the  EU. That puts pressure on the U.S. to step up.   You might think that free trade between Europe and America already  reigns, given the massive scale of existing economic ties. The  trade relationship works fairly well. Tariffs are indeed small.  Regulations tend to be more of a nuisance than a monumental burden.  Yet eliminating the tariffs, rolling back a hodgepodge of national  rules and harmonizing regulations that govern everything from  pharmaceuticals to auto parts could make a big difference.   The opportunity is so great because of the enormous amount of money  involved. The U.S. and EU account for half of all world economic  output. U.S. trade with Europe totaled $485 billion in the first  nine months of this year -- almost $100 billion more than U.S.  trade with China. U.S. exports of goods to Europe accounted for  $200 billion.   Europeans buy a lot of American-made stuff. They're good customers.   We know from experience that when trade barriers fall, good  customers become even better customers. The U.S. Chamber of  Commerce estimates that bringing tariffs to zero would boost  U.S.-EU trade by more than $120 billion within five years. Economic  growth, as measured by gross domestic product, would get an even  bigger boost. The flow of investment between the continents would  surge.   We recognize that a trade deal would be complicated. Agriculture no  doubt would be a sticking point. Europe protects its farmers  zealously. It panders to unwarranted fears about genetically  modified crops and livestock. It has a history of restricting  competition for individual products based on geography: Think  Champagne and Parmesan cheese.   The U.S. is no saint when it comes to agricultural protectionism,  either. To pick but one egregious example, American consumers pay a  steep price to subsidize a few wealthy domestic sugar growers.  Other trade barriers have some basis in justifiable concerns, such  as workplace standards, national security, environmental safeguards  and consumer protection.   Still, the U.S. has overcome these issues in free-trade agreements  with nations far less in sync with it than Germany and Britain.   The sovereign debt crisis is forcing Europe to reform its economic  policies anyway, including sweeping revisions to labor-market  rules. As a result, some potentially difficult issues will be moot  even before the two sides come to the bargaining table.   We hope the president hops on Air Force One sometime in the next  couple of months and seizes the moment. Anemic growth in the U.S.  and the debt crisis in Europe give both sides a compelling  incentive to break a senseless stalemate and knock down the final  barriers to trade.  ",2012-11-29
18,1690187442.xml,"       Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras headed to Brussels late Sunday for a crucial emergency eurozone summit aimed at reaching a deal between Athens and its international creditors that would allow the debt-ravaged country to avoid a default and a potentially disastrous exit from the euro. Tsipras' departure for Monday's summit of the 19 eurozone leaders capped a day of intense contacts between many of the major players, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, all bent on keeping Greece within the currency club and avoiding financial chaos.   Greece is facing a June 30 deadline to make a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund, which, at present, it would be unable to make, and even bigger payments to the European Central Bank in July. So far, Greece and the creditors have appeared locked in a ""who-blinks-first"" contest that has left them unable to bridge the gaps and secure a deal.   On Sunday, Tsipras presented to Juncker, Hollande and Merkel ""Greece's proposal for a mutually beneficial agreement, which will provide a permanent solution and not just postpone tackling the problem,"" his press office said in a statement.   However, technical negotiators from the creditors were still waiting in Brussels for a detailed outline of the Greek proposals late Sunday to assess whether they really constitute a breakthrough, a European Union official said.   ""The institutions are waiting,"" the official said, more than eight hours after the Greek government announced they had presented the proposal to creditors. ""The condition for this meeting to be productive is to have the proposal.""   The official asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.   Over the past few weeks, the international creditors have often complained that Greek initiatives have been too slow to come and far too vague.   In Milan, Hollande told reporters that everything must be done to keep Greece in the eurozone because ""if the Greeks leave the eurozone it won't be positive for the Greeks or Europeans.""   ""We need stability,"" especially because many European nations are beginning to rebound economically, he said. ""For this reason we must reach an accord.""   Tsipras met with his senior ministers all day in Athens and left for Brussels Sunday evening.   Ahead of the eurozone summit Monday, Tsipras will hold a one-on-one meeting with EU President Donald Tusk and will then join a meeting, convened by Tusk, with Juncker, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, Tsipras' press office said.   Talks between Greece and its creditors on the completion of an earlier bailout deal had already hit a snag before the January election of the anti-bailout, anti-austerity coalition government headed by the radical leftist Syriza party.   As a result, Greece has not received any bailout funds since summer 2014, and its ailing banking system is only kept afloat through a weekly infusion of emergency funds from the European Central Bank.   The new government's radically different approach, essentially denying the need for austerity measures, which it calls ""recessionary,"" has often stretched the talks in the past five months to the breaking point.   About 5,000 attended a pro-government rally in central Athens on Sunday night. On Thursday, a strong rally was held by those favoring a deal with the EU. The pro-EU forces will gather again Monday evening outside Parliament.   Syriza and similar leftist political groups have organized ""solidarity to Greece"" rallies across Europe over the weekend or joined related protests such as an anti-austerity march in the U.K. on Saturday.

19,1369724683.xml,"       Afghanistan's president abruptly canceled ongoing security  negotiations with the U.S., with his office charging Wednesday that  the Obama administration had said one thing and done another while  arranging peace talks with the insurgent Taliban movement. President Barack Obama quickly rejected the criticism, saying, ""We  had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some  areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the  ground.""  President Hamid Karzai's reputation in Washington as a mercurial  U.S. ally was reinforced by his administration's decision, which  came a day before U.S. officials were to begin direct negotiations  with the Taliban. Analysts said the announcement suggested Karzai  was miffed at being excluded from initial meetings between  Washington and the insurgents.  In a terse statement, the Afghan president's office said the  government would stop participating in the security talks given a  ""contradiction"" between U.S. words and deeds on the peace process.  In a second statement a few hours later, it added that Afghan  officials wouldn't attend separate negotiations with the Taliban  planned in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar until they were ""fully  Afghanized"" and that the opening of a Taliban political office  Monday in Doha, the Qatari capital, undermined earlier assurances  from the United States.  The statement didn't say what those assurances were or how long the  suspension would last. The security talks are aimed at defining the  U.S.-Afghan relationship after American-led foreign forces'  departure from Afghanistan, scheduled for the end of next year.  Obama said that misunderstandings aren't surprising given the  enormous mistrust between the Afghan government and the Taliban,  but that it was still important to explore opportunities for a  political reconciliation.  ""Not only have the Taliban and the Afghan government been fighting  for a long time, they're fighting as we speak,"" he said at a news  conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We're  in the middle of a war. And Afghans are still being killed and, by  the way, members of the international forces there are still being  killed.""  Underscoring his point, four Americans were killed in a Taliban  rocket attack on Bagram Air Field in eastern Afghanistan late  Tuesday just as Obama was announcing negotiations with the  insurgent group in an ""important first step"" toward reconciliation.  The Afghan government earlier outlined conditions it wanted  Washington to insist on before the Taliban talks, which an Obama  administration official said would begin Thursday. Those conditions  included a commitment by the insurgent group to communicate with  the Afghan government, acknowledge the legitimacy of the Afghan  Constitution and renounce violence.  The U.S., which has had informal contact with the Taliban in recent  years without much result, didn't insist on these demands, to  Karzai's apparent displeasure.  The Karzai administration is also reportedly unhappy that the  Taliban opened its political office in Qatar with great fanfare as  the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" while flying the Taliban flag,  suggesting that it, rather than the Afghan government, represented  the country's interests.  Waheed Muzhda, a Kabul-based political analyst, said the U.S. has  balked at signing a security agreement, not Karzai, who's eager to  pin down Washington on the aid it will provide. The Obama  administration prefers to speak with the Taliban first, then worry  about Kabul's interests, Muzhda added, aware that a new Afghan  government will take over after the 2014 general election.  Despite their government's unhappiness, some Afghans on Wednesday  said negotiations with the Taliban gave them hope.  Nangyalai, 25, a Kabul taxi driver who uses one name, said he  welcomed the talks.  ""It will be great if the Taliban stop killing their Muslim  brothers,"" Nangyalai said.  Kabul's announcement came a day after troops led by NATO  transferred final security responsibility to Afghan forces. Obama  said negotiations with the Karzai government about the scope of  international training and advising after 2014 had been difficult.  Washington and the Afghan president's office have had their share  of differences over the terms of the bilateral security agreement.  The terms include whether U.S. forces would be immune from  prosecution under a ""status of forces"" agreement governing military  relations between the two countries.

20,1520560284.xml,"       In the worst day of bloodshed yet, armed clashes left scores of  people dead in Ukraine on Friday as President Barack Obama and  German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to impose far stiffer  economic sanctions on Russia if it disrupts upcoming Ukrainian  elections, effectively setting a new trigger. Officials said 42 people were killed in battles between government  supporters and Russian-backed separatists in the southern city of  Odessa, which has largely escaped violence until now. The Black Sea  port is predominantly Russian-speaking, but physically and  culturally closer to the pro-European western areas of Ukraine.   Thirty people died when fire and smoke engulfed the central trade  union building, where pro-Russia separatists were said to be  shooting from upper floors at pro-unity demonstrators in the  streets, police said.   Eight others died when they jumped out of the burning building,  authorities said.   The deadly blaze followed a day of running street battles in the  historic port. At one point, rival groups of protesters converged,  setting off a melee of hurled Molotov cocktails, stun grenades and  cobblestones, according to news agency reports. That clash left  four dead and at least 15 wounded, police said.   In eastern Ukraine, the focus of the deepening crisis, pro-Russian  rebels shot down two Ukrainian MI-24 military helicopters trying to  retake the separatist stronghold of Slovyansk, one of more than a  dozen cities held by the rebels.   The fledgling government in Kiev has launched an offensive in the  Slovyansk area with armored columns and aircraft, but so far its  troops have struggled to gain ground.   Ukrainian officials said two soldiers were killed and seven  injured, but most of the city of 130,000 apparently was still in  rebel hands.   ""We are holding on to our positions and are not planning a  retreat,"" the self-proclaimed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav  Ponomaryov, said in a telephone interview.   He said six military inspectors from the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe and their translator, who were abducted  by separatists last week, ""are well and taken care of in a safe  place in town.""   The day's death toll was the highest in more than two months of  turmoil in eastern and southern Ukraine.   Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, blamed Moscow for  fueling the growing violence, and accused pro-Russian forces of  hiding behind civilians.   ""Our power structures are engaged in a fight with mercenaries from  a foreign state and criminals which take hostages, kill and torture  people,"" Turchynov said in a televised address.   Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on the interim  government in Kiev to withdraw its military from the east, ceding  control to the separatists. Moscow has deployed tens of thousands  of Russian troops near its border with Ukraine and claimed the  right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians.   Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the ITAR-Tass news agency  Friday that Russia ""is making efforts to de-escalate and resolve  the conflict"" and blamed Kiev for a ""punitive operation"" in  Slovyansk that hurt chances for peace.   In Washington, Obama and Merkel presented a united front against  Russia at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden. The two  leaders threatened broad sanctions against Russia's major economic  sectors if Moscow does not rein in the armed militants who have  destabilized eastern Ukraine and threaten to disrupt presidential  elections later this month.   ""The next step is going to be a broader-based sectoral sanctions  regime,"" Obama said. ""If in fact we see the disruptions and the  destabilization continuing so severely that it impedes elections on  May 25, we will not have a choice but to move forward with  additional, more severe sanctions.""   Obama has warned of tougher penalties if Putin ordered his troops  to invade Ukraine. But U.S. and European travel bans and asset  freezes on several dozen of Putin's political allies and business  associates, plus a handful of banks and companies, have shown no  sign of persuading the Russian leader to pull his troops.   On Friday, the two leaders appeared to adjust the trigger point for  more aggressive action, with Merkel calling the elections  ""crucial.""   The recalibration reflects a growing view in the West that the  upcoming elections present the best, if still long-shot, hope for a  peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis.   Obama vented frustration with Putin's claims that Russia is not  supporting the militants.   ""Generally, local protesters don't possess that capacity of  surface-to-air missiles or whatever weapons were used to shoot down  helicopters,"" he said.   Germany, the largest economy in Europe, is viewed as a linchpin in  the West's attempts to craft a unified response to the Ukraine  conflict.   The German economy is closely linked to Russia, especially its  energy supplies, and major German businesses and industries have  lobbied against imposing penalties that will damage their bottom  line.   ----------  khennessey@tribune.com Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey and Sergei L.

21,812124420.xml,"      Passive smoking's global toll WHO: Secondhand exposure kills 600,000 LONDON   -- Around one in 100 deaths worldwide is due to passive smoking, which kills an estimated 600,000 people a year, World Health Organization researchers said Friday. The study, the first to assess the global impact of secondhand smoke, found that children are more heavily exposed to secondhand smoke than any other age group, and around 165,000 of them a year die because of it. ""Two-thirds of these deaths occur in Africa and south Asia,"" the researchers, led by Dr. Annette Pruss-Ustun of the WHO in Geneva, wrote in their study. Children's exposure to secondhand smoke is most likely to happen at home, and the double blow of infectious diseases and tobacco ""seems to be a deadly combination for children in these regions."" Commenting on the findings in the Lancet journal, the University of Southern California's Heather Wipfli and Dr. Jonathan Samet said policymakers should try to motivate families to stop smoking in the home. ""In some countries, smoke-free homes are becoming the norm, but far from universally,"" they wrote. Worldwide, 40 percent of children, 33 percent of nonsmoking men and 35 percent of nonsmoking women were exposed to secondhand smoke in 2004, researchers found. This exposure was estimated to have caused 379,000 deaths from heart disease, 165,000 from lower respiratory infections, 36,900 from asthma and 21,400 from lung cancer.

NATION 2nd drug tunnel found U.S. authorities say they have discovered another extensive drug tunnel that stretches from a home in Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego. The half-mile tunnel, discovered Thursday morning in a warehouse in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego, is close to a similar one federal agents found earlier this month, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said. In that case, authorities seized about 30 tons of marijuana in what federal agents say is one of the largest marijuana seizures in U.S. history. Agents have made several arrests in connection with Thursday's tunnel discovery, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the customs agency. WORLD Officials: Euro solid BERLIN   -- Senior eurozone officials dismissed any risk of the single currency area breaking up after financial markets, alarmed by Ireland's debt crisis, forced the borrowing costs of Portugal and Spain to record highs. ""There is zero danger,"" Klaus Regling, chief of the euro's financial safety net, European Financial Stability Facility, told German daily Bild in an interview published Thursday. His comment came when he was asked if the eurozone could break apart. Some economists and commentators, mostly in Britain and the United States, have suggested the 16-nation common currency launched in 1999 could split because of peripheral members' high debts and deficits, and a loss of competitiveness with Germany. In Haiti, police part rival factions as vote looms PORT-AU-PRINCE  -- Armed Haitian police kept apart boisterous supporters of rival presidential candidates in Port-au-Prince on Thursday as the earthquake-hit Caribbean country heads for turbulent elections this weekend. The separate marches by backers of two leading presidential contenders -- Jude Celestin, a protege of outgoing President Rene Preval, and musician ""Sweet Micky"" Martelly -- clogged streets Thursday but armed police stopped them from clashing. Haiti is still recovering from an earthquake and battling a cholera epidemic. Ex-SS soldier's extradition sought AMSTERDAM -- The Netherlands will use a new legal procedure to seek the extradition from Germany of an 88-year-old Dutchman who was jailed for killing Jewish prisoners at a Nazi transit camp, but escaped from prison in 1952. The extradition of former SS soldier Klaas Carel Faber has been hindered by a German law preventing extradition of German nationals for war crimes. However, Germany itself sentenced another former Dutch Nazi, Heinrich Broere, to life in prison in March this year. A special Dutch prosecution team that seeks to enforce older sentences said Thursday it had issued a European arrest warrant against Faber. That warrant supersedes national regulations and, prosecutors argue, could allow Germany to hand him over for trial. Greek rebels claim they sent parcel bombs ATHENS  -- A Greek guerrilla group claimed responsibility Thursday for a wave of parcel bombs sent to foreign governments and embassies in Athens this month and warned of more attacks. The booby-trapped packages were sent to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, among other foreign targets. The parcel sent to Merkel was intercepted at her office and rendered harmless. Another addressed to Berlusconi caught fire when Italian police opened it. The Fire Conspiracy Cells, which describes itself as an anti-state group, said in a statement on a leftist Web site it had staged the attacks to encourage groups in other countries to strike against state targets.

22,1654888527.xml,"       European leaders hoping to avert the infusion of U.S. weapons  into the Ukraine conflict heralded a new cease-fire agreement  Thursday after marathon negotiations with the Russian and Ukrainian  presidents. But the peace plan's success hinges on the combatants delivering on  promises they've made and broken before.   The deal crafted by the leaders of Germany, France, Russia and  Ukraine calls for a halt to hostilities by Sunday and withdrawal of  heavy weapons and foreign fighters from the battlefields within two  weeks. It also requires restoration of Ukrainian government control  over its eastern border by the end of this year, contingent on Kiev  granting more autonomy to the restive regions.   There were gains and losses for both sides, but also enough  vagueness in some provisions to induce broad skepticism that the  peace plan will work. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin  and his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, immediately gave  conflicting accounts of how the fierce battle now raging over a  strategic railway junction in the town of Debaltseve is to be  resolved.   Two elements of the 13-point peace plan brokered by German  Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande  appeared to pose particularly worrisome pitfalls.   One is the vast no man's land that will be left between the  Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government forces if  they comply with the withdrawal provisions. As wide as 87 miles in  places, it could offer an alluring incentive for either side to  move in.   The other major stumbling block is likely to be the long lead time  -- more than 10 months -- before the separatists have to surrender  control of eastern Ukraine's border with Russia to Kiev  authorities. The rebel-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions have  depended on reinforcements from Russia throughout the conflict, and  the looming threat of losing that lifeline creates another  disincentive for the separatists to abide by the agreement.   The separatists reportedly signed off on the details of the  agreement, and Putin pledged to use his influence to see that they  are enforced. In return, the Ukrainian government is obligated to  resume paying pensions and salaries to residents of the occupied  areas, a move that should bolster the rebels' standing with their  battered constituents.   Nearly a million people have fled eastern Ukraine since fighting  erupted 10 months ago, and those left behind have suffered through  a winter of water, heating and electricity interruptions, food and  medicine shortages and near-daily artillery barrages.   One key setback for the separatist leaders was that the accord  calls for elections for regional government offices under Ukrainian  law.   Russia's official Tass news agency said the peace plan sets out a  one-month deadline for organizing a new vote, an ambitious prospect  for the regions that have been cut off from central rule since  April.   Even more daunting for the Ukrainian leadership will be the  accord's requirement for constitutional changes to decentralize  power from Kiev and give more latitude to the diverse regions to  set trade and security policy. Ukrainian lawmakers have said they  won't even discuss decentralization unless all occupied territory  is returned to Kiev's control.   The degree to which Ukraine must devolve power to regions was  unclear, leaving Putin and Poroshenko to both claim victory.   ""The expanding of powers for Ukraine's regions will proceed within  the framework of constitutional changes aimed at decentralization,""  Poroshenko said in a statement posted on the presidential website.  ""We haven't accepted a single compromise aimed at federalization.""   Putin sought the ""federalization"" of Ukraine, which would give even  greater authority to the regions, because it would in effect give  him veto power through his separatist proxies over important  decisions by the Kiev government. The Russian president has been  especially determined to stop Ukraine from pursuing membership in  the European Union and NATO.   It was western Ukrainians' toppling of Kremlin-allied President  Viktor Yanukovych a year ago that handed power to pro-Europe  politicians who antagonized Putin by setting course for reorienting  Ukraine's relations to the West.   ----------  sloiko@tribune.com Credit: By Sergei L.

The arrogance of the age -- maybe every age -- is that intellectuals believe, by default, that they're smarter, more moral, and more evolved than those who came before them.-- David Harsanyi, The Federalist Last August, when Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed to boost German defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, her left-leaning coalition partners, the Social Democratic Party, responded that the money would be better spent on humanitarian assistance and diplomacy. They were right. You'd think American liberals -- many of whom have criticized Trump for slashing spending on the State Department -- would recognize that. What American liberals should be saying is not that Germany's defense spending is too low but that America's is too high. Plenty of Democratic voters, after all, desperately want the kind of welfare state that Germans already have. They want to check in to the hospital without risking bankruptcy and to attend college without going into debt. Higher defense spending means less money to achieve those goals.-- Peter Beinart, The Atlantic",2018-07-22

They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any ""racial animus"" toward minorities.Still, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights.As part of the plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges.

Sudan Information Minister Ahmed Belal Osman said that four planes  bombed the Yarmouk complex housing a military arms factory in the  south of the capital, and that an analysis of rocket debris from  the explosion confirmed Israel was behind the attack.   ""We think Israel did the bombing,"" Belal said. ""We reserve the  right to react at a place and time we choose.""   Israeli government and military officials declined to comment on  Sudan's statement Wednesday.   Analysts said such a strike by Israel would not be surprising given  Israel's claims that Sudan is helping to arm Palestinian militants.   The Yarmouk arms factory was thought to be ""part of the smuggling  trail leading from Iran, Sudan, Egypt into the Sinai and finally  into Gaza,"" said Ehud Yaari, Arab affairs commentator for Israel's  Channel 2.   Israel has also raised alarms recently about sophisticated weapons  that have been smuggled out of Libya since the collapse of Moammar  Gadhafi's regime. This month, militants in Gaza for the first time  fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli aircraft.   Meanwhile, Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip fired dozens of  rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel on Wednesday in the  heaviest bombardment of the area in months.

26,1860059700.xml,"       At foreign embassies across Washington, envoys say they are  bracing for the unknown when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn  into office Friday and starts issuing orders. In capitals around the globe, leaders and foreign policy experts  worry that Trump's calls for radical change could produce  instability or worse in a global crisis.  They are confused by his provocative tweets and worry that he may  upend long-held alliances, treaties and international  organizations.  From the Mexico to China, rarely before has an incoming U.S.  president so discombobulated the rest of the world, allies and  adversaries alike.  Last weekend, Trump gave interviews to two newspapers, one British  and one German, in which he said he was indifferent to the fate of  the European Union political and trading bloc, and argued that the  NATO military alliance, the bedrock of European security since  World War II, is obsolete.  Both have been pillars of trans-Atlantic cooperation for decades  and helped produce peace and prosperity in Europe and in the United  States.  ""We just don't know,"" is how one Washington-based envoy said his  embassy usually explains Trump's comments and tweets in cables back  home.  The diplomat was not authorized to speak publicly about U.S.  politics.  It hasn't helped that many of Trump's designated Cabinet members,  especially his choices for Defense and State, as well as U.S.  ambassador to the United Nations, distanced themselves from Trump  on the threat from Russia, the future of NATO, the need to keep the  Iran nuclear deal, the danger of global warming and other issues.  Europeans, in particular, are nervous about Trump's repeated praise  for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is widely viewed with  alarm for sending his troops into Ukraine and up against NATO's  borders, and for trying to interfere with Western elections.  Allies also have yet to get clarity about Trump's comments last  year suggesting that Japan, South Korea and other nations should  build nuclear weapons for their own defense, a policy that would  end decades of U.S. non-proliferation efforts.  If Trump's signals are mixed and fuzzy, the consequences are coming  into focus.  After he called German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to admit  thousands of Syrian refugees a ""catastrophic mistake,"" she said it  was clear Europe had to think about going it alone, or at least  without the United States as a reliable partner.  Merkels' French colleague, President Francois Hollande, echoed her.  ""Europe will be ready to pursue trans-Atlantic cooperation, but it  will based on its interests and values,"" Hollande said. ""It does  not need outside advice to tell it what to do.""  The French minister of foreign affairs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, went  further, challenging Trump's eagerness to champion Britain's  decision to withdraw from the European Union and his open cheer  leading for the EU to dissolve.  ""The best response is European unity,"" Ayrault said. ""The best way  to defend Europe is to remain united. This is a bit of an  invitation that we are making to Mr. Trump. To remain a bloc. Not  to forget that the force of Europeans is in their unity.""  China also has had trouble making out what Trump intends.  But Beijing has wasted no time in flexing its own muscles.  In another sign of a new world order, Chinese President Xi Jinping  became the poster child for free trade at this week's annual  meeting of the world's top entrepreneurs, political leaders and  other jet-setters in Davos, Switzerland.  Xi assumed a role that normally would have gone to an American -- a  void left, some say, by Trump's all-over-the-map declarations about  ripping up trade agreements and challenging China's currency and  economic policies.  Trump acts ""stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the  job, though he speaks like a rookie,"" said the People's Daily,  China's Communist Party daily.  In an unusual move, three foreign ambassadors took part in a live  radio program Thursday in Washington to discuss their government's  dealings with the incoming administration.  David O'Sullivan, the European Union envoy, was in the most  difficult spot.  He said he expected Trump eventually will become aware of the  critical relationship between Washington and the 28-nation  continental bloc.  ""If we don't get it right, there will be huge consequences for us  all,"" he added.  ---------- tracy.wilkinson@latimes.com Credit: By Tracy Wilkinson, Washington Bureau Caption: Photo: China's Xi Jinping took the lead on free trade at the World  Economic Forum in Switzerland.

27,1021443279.xml,"      If the United States were still governed under the Articles of  Confederation, might California be in the position of Greece, Spain  or Italy? After all, California has a major budget crisis and all sorts of  difficulties governing itself. Its initiative system allows voters  to mandate specific forms of spending and to limit tax increases  and also make them harder to enact. Absent a strong federal  government with the power to offset the impact of the recession and  the banking crisis, how would California fare in a global financial  system?  OK, no metaphor is perfect, and there's a compelling case that this  sprawling and economically diverse state would perform better in  the global economy than the beleaguered nations of southern Europe.  Moreover, Gov. Jerry Brown deserves credit for trying to get a  handle on the California budget crisis. He's going to the voters  this fall with a referendum to raise about $8 billion in taxes to  stave off further cuts. Without the money, Brown said, education  spending would have to be slashed beyond the cutbacks that have  already taken effect.  But the metaphor is instructive because it turns on its head the  usual nonsense from anti-government politicians that the United  States is on the road to becoming Greece. No, we're not. Our issues  are entirely different. To the extent that the crisis in Europe has  lessons for the United States, they go the other way.  First, we are lucky to have a robust federal government, which the  European Union lacks. Early in the recession, the feds were able to  offset problems in the country's most troubled regions with a  stimulus program (and also with that auto bailout that so many,  including Mitt Romney, opposed). The stimulus should have been  bigger, and it should have extended over a longer period. But it  helped.  Second, we bailed out our banks right away and also have a more  effective central bank. We thus avoided some of the problems now  facing Europe, notably in Spain. Again, we need to do more, not  less, to deal with the damage caused by the housing bubble, which  is especially threatening in parts of California. But the United  States bit the bullet immediately to deal with potential insolvency  in the banks, and the Obama administration's stress tests helped  restore confidence in the system.  By contrast, Europe created a common currency without a central  bank as powerful as the Federal Reserve -- and without a  continental fiscal policy that cuts across its member states. In a  genuine federal system, the better-off states help the states that  fall into trouble.  Greece needs reform and large transfers from the wealthier states  of Europe -- yes, that means Germany -- to reverse its economy's  free fall. Our federal system mostly disguises the transfers that  take place across state and regional lines. (Many of these, by the  way, take money out of California.) Yet because we all think of  ourselves as Americans, we don't usually object to them. It's not  quite like asking Germans to help Greeks or Italians.  What's happened so far in Europe is austerity without enough  stimulus. This is a recipe for keeping economies down, unemployment  high and electorates in an entirely understandable rage. No wonder  historians and economists are now regularly offering frightening  comparisons between the Europe of our times and the Europe of the  early 1930s. If established parties tell voters they must suffer  indefinitely, extreme parties begin to look attractive. The urgency  of containing extremism is one motivation for French President  Francois Hollande's call for reversing austerity, and his hand was  strengthened by his Socialist Party's legislative election victory  last weekend.  The real lesson from Europe is not that we should all tighten our  belts and endure more pain but that we need to get the global  economy moving. That means our Federal Reserve should pursue more  expansive policies. And if congressional Republicans weren't so  determined to block nearly every initiative President Barack Obama  puts forward, they would agree to pump more money into state  governments and into infrastructure spending to speed a decline in  unemployment.  As for Europe, it has gotten a reprieve from Greece's voters, but  German Chancellor Angela Merkel should not see this as a mandate  for continuing current policies. I understand why Merkel is  reluctant to transfer German money to Greece, Spain and Italy. But  her approach is no longer sustainable. The world needs growth, and  it needs it fast.  ---------- E.J.

28,1020499676.xml,"      The Sunday cruise on the Chicago River was called ""The Love Boat."" The label came from the Spanish press, after being briefed about  German Chancellor Angela Merkel's warm endorsement of Spain's prime  minister's efforts to cut budget deficits and scrap uncompetitive  labor laws.  But in reality, Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, stepped  ashore fuming in private frustration after the May 20 boat ride  before the NATO summit. That Sunday cruise sank any hope the German  chancellor might let Spain's government off the hook for a fix to  plug big holes in the accounts of Spanish banks and brought Rajoy,  three weeks later, to swallow pride and accept a huge EU bailout  that Berlin had quietly been urging on him for months.  Rajoy ""hit a wall,"" confided a government source in Madrid, one of  many officials whose remarks build a picture of how, with markets  losing patience in a eurozone buffeted by Greek elections, Spain  asked for and got a $126 billion loan with some face-saving  elements Saturday.  Merkel had been sounded on ways to bend EU rules and pump cash back  into Spain's sick banks without the Spanish state accepting funds  in its own name. Madrid had been exploring a range of options,  since Rajoy had feared a humiliating comparison with Greece,  Ireland and Portugal and the foreign supervision those bailouts  imposed on smaller nations whose debts have poisoned the common  currency.  But May 20, after hours huddled over a table on a vessel modeled on  the presidential yacht USS Sequoia, the local lawyer from rural  Galicia, in the job for just six months and short on diplomatic  experience, appears to have realized Merkel's kind words did not  add up to a ""yes.""  Things picked up speed in the three weeks after the NATO summit,  leading to a final few days in which the language of public denial  from Madrid turned subtly into a silence that as good as confirmed  a deal was done.  Crucially, in the days after Chicago, Merkel began to signal a  willingness to help Rajoy save some face by routing aid more or  less directly to Spanish banks via an EU fund set up for the  purpose and with fewer strings than a state bailout, albeit that  the loan would still add to the national debt.  On May 23, when Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said major  lender Bankia, subject of an emergency nationalization, would need  at least $11.2 billion, Rajoy insisted, ""The government has no  interest and no intention in accessing any funds from the European  Union or any other organization.""  Two days later, as Bankia said it really needed more than twice  that amount, that assertion was wearing thin, not least as Spain's  autonomous regions were raising alarms about their own, separate  fundraising.  After the weekend, as officials stuck to the line that Madrid could  bail out its own banks, one senior official spoke May 29 of  ""another plan"" in the works for EU aid now that Madrid's hopes for  new European Central Bank lending had all but vanished.  In public and private, German officials were careful to say that  Spain was not being bullied and was free to judge its own policy.  Pressure, they knew, could backfire, and there was some sympathy in  Berlin for Rajoy's predicament in being beholden to murky private  bank balance sheets and also to big-spending autonomous regions  with powers not unlike Germany's own states.  ""It is totally up to Spain to decide how to solve its problems,"" a  German source said at the time. ""We just warned of the danger that  if Spain waits too long, the risk could grow that the country has  to apply for a full-fledged program.""  After talks between de Guindos and Germany's finance minister,  officials in Berlin began to leak ideas into the German media that  Madrid could save face by accepting aid into its national banks'  fund.  Rajoy made a keynote speech June 2 spelling out his vision for  Europe.  By declaring his willingness to subject Spain to a common EU fiscal  authority, he underlined a commitment to budgetary rigor and stable  future for the euro that would help Merkel justify to German voters  why Spain merited help, even if such mechanisms for fiscal union  were pure theory.  With public holidays June 4 in London and New York, offering a  measure of calm to the markets, Merkel met European Commission  President Jose Manuel Barroso. They spent the evening planning how  to time and announce a bailout of Spanish banks.  Playing for time, Rajoy was still pushing for the loosest of terms,  hoping to avoid having to formally seek funds from the EU. And his  European partners were growing increasingly anxious to finish a  deal before Greece's next elections, which are this Sunday, a  moment that may spark a new wave of market panic if the winners  decide to default on Athens' debts.  Merkel stepped up Germany's pressure on Spain by saying the EU  stood ready to help Madrid and, after days of denying in public  that a rescue was afoot, Spanish officials stopped taking calls  from reporters.  When official sources in the eurozone confirmed on the morning of  June 8 that Spain would ask formally for credit in a conference  call the next day, markets reacted sharply, but Rajoy's spokeswoman  only would say she knew of no plans for a call, and his deputy  premier deflected repeated questions at a news conference by noting  the auditors' results were not in.  Yet when Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria  finally conceded that ""at least a preliminary figure"" would be  needed for any bailout, she as good as confirmed that International  Monetary Fund experts who were running the data were about to give  a rough target for what banks needed.  The IMF did just that, saying at least $50.5 billion was required,  while officials indicated that more would be better.  Spain did not give up negotiating. There was even talk from  officials that, after senior eurozone negotiators had spoken by  telephone for two hours Saturday morning to shape the final  package, Madrid threatened to walk away from the deal.  It did not, however, and de Guindos agreed to ask for and accept a  loan worth nearly 10 percent of Spain's annual income during a  second call with his peers.  It was a haggard economic minister, his first words drowned out by  clattering cameras, who told Spaniards that, in effect, they had  finally accepted a German offer.  Only the next morning did the prime minister appear. He defended  what he insisted was not a ""rescue"" and denied he was cowardly in  letting de Guindos announce it. And he would not cancel a flight to  Poland to see Spain's soccer world champions play, potentially a  more agreeable Sunday diversion than that cruise down the Chicago  River with Merkel.

29,1985565830.xml,"For a dozen years, Angela Merkel seemingly floated above the laws of political gravity, making her calm and consensual leadership style as much a part of the German landscape as fairy-tale castles, precision engineering and beer-saturated Octobers.
But the early days of her 13th year as chancellor have been marked by a bracing return to Earth. Every political career ends, and Merkel's finale may be coming faster than just about anyone had predicted. Her rapidly diminishing political stock threatens to leave a void not only in Germany, but across the West, just as she had emerged as the most robust internationalist counterpoint to Trump-style nativism.
Merkel's troubles started with a bitterly disappointing election result in September. They grew when her first attempt at forging a new government collapsed in November. And they have been compounded in recent days, as polls have shown German voters tiring of her leadership.
Merkel now has what many regard as a last shot to cobble together a coalition and ward off an embarrassing electoral do-over that could see her lose her grip on power.
""Time is running out,"" said Stefan Kornelius, a Merkel biographer. ""She is under immense pressure to somehow make this happen.""
But even if she succeeds, significant damage has already been done. Once regarded as invincible, Merkel is suddenly vulnerable in a way that has shifted the German political conversation to a topic long whispered about but rarely publicly debated before: Who should come next?
There are many contenders, their names bandied about in German newspapers and magazines in recent days. But Merkel's saving grace - for now, at least - may be that there is no obvious successor.
There's certainly no one who could immediately fill the outsize role that Merkel has played in global affairs. Though not always willingly, the low-key East German with a PhD in quantum chemistry has become de facto leader of Europe and keeper-of-the-flame for those who regard President Donald Trump's brand of politics as a threat to core Western values.
""The world is engulfed by Trumpism and populism and vulgarianism,"" said Kornelius, a journalist with Munich's Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""The alternative is not even visible any more. Merkel has to prove that the alternative can still exist.""
She might not have the chance.
Over her dozen years in office, Merkel has guided Germany to robust economic health, with strong GDP growth and low unemployment. Her decision to welcome more than 1 million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 galvanized the far right but was supported by the political mainstream. She has navigated a series of European crises, from the war in Ukraine to Greek debt.
Before the September elections, political observers had widely assumed that Merkel would once again coast to victory, with a clear shot at matching the record 16-year tenure of her onetime mentor, Helmut Kohl.
Instead, her center-right Christian Democratic Union suffered its worst result since 1949, including the loss of a million of its voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
While the CDU still came out on top of a fractured field, Merkel was forced to pursue an unwieldy deal among her own conservative bloc, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens.
When the Free Democrats unexpectedly backed out, Merkel had to go to plan B: a revival of the grand coalition between the center-right and the center-left that has governed Europe's largest economy for the past four years.
Substantive talks are only now getting underway, with a deal not expected before April, if one comes at all. It's already the longest that postwar Germany has ever gone after an election without a government.
Although voters didn't initially appear to blame Merkel, polls suggest she has increasingly become the target of frustration with the very un-German gridlock and dysfunction.
A survey published by the Bild newspaper in late December showed that nearly half the country did not want her to complete a fourth term. A poll released days later by Die Welt had even worse news for Merkel: Nearly half the country would like her to step down right away.
""She is tasked with putting together a government, and she hasn't done it,"" said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund and a former presidential adviser. ""There's a failure on her side that the constitution attributes to her and that the people seem to attribute to her.""
More than that, Kleine-Brockhoff said, Merkel's core argument for staying in power may be fraying. The 63-year-old has long positioned herself as the guarantor of stability for a country that prizes that quality.
Yet in the current talks, he said, her presence may be more destabilizing than not.
The Social Democrats, the government's would-be junior partner, are desperate to get rid of Merkel. Her tenure has corresponded with a free-fall in the party's popularity as the chancellor has shifted to the center and co-opted the Social Democrats' core issues. The party's rank and file will have to approve any deal, which could prove a hurdle.
Even Merkel's own party, which has long been disciplined in supporting her, may have a reason to see her go early, since it will want to ensure an orderly transition to her successor.
""We will be seeing the last period of government for Angela Merkel, and it will be heavily influenced by, if not overshadowed by, the question of succession,"" Kleine-Brockhoff said.
Although leading politicians from the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have generally been circumspect about their desire for the top job, that's beginning to change.
Jens Spahn, a 37-year-old who is considered a rising star on the CDU's right flank, has urged Merkel not to give an inch in talks with the Social Democrats and for the CDU and CSU to form a government on its own if negotiations fail.
But there may be some self-interest in that advice: Without a stable coalition government, Germany could be forced to hold new elections far earlier than planned, perhaps as soon as this year. And it's unclear whether Merkel would lead her party in another vote.
""That's a secret that's hidden in her heart,"" said Jürgen Hardt, a veteran CDU member of Parliament and the party's spokesman on foreign affairs.
Hardt said there is no question that Merkel should remain as chancellor and have the opportunity to lead a new coalition government.
""There's no one else who is able to get so much support from the Bundestag and from the public,"" Hardt said, referring to the German Parliament.
But he also said it was time for her to promote possible successors, and to allow a younger generation to prove itself.
""There are too few new faces on the political scene in Germany,"" said the 54-year-old. ""The CDU and the CSU have to be aware that sometimes, politics is about presenting something new.""
It's been a long time since Germany has done that. Of the world leaders who have stuck around as long as Merkel, most are autocrats who resort to iron-fisted tactics.
Merkel, if anything, has positioned herself as the anti-autocrat - a defender of traditional democratic values at a time when those are seeming evermore outdated.
If she leaves, said Jürgen Falter, a politics professor at the University of Mainz, ""it would weaken the European Union and it would weaken those who want the West to be led in a more rational way than Trump is able to do.""
Already, Merkel's voice has been more muted on major European matters, including Britain's European Union exit and euro zone reforms initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron. Although she continues to lead a caretaker government, it cannot make any significant moves until the parties reach a coalition deal.
With months of talks probably still ahead, Merkel has struggled not to show impatience with a process that she surely knows is sapping German influence, and her own, by the day.
""The world,"" she told the nation in her traditional New Year's Eve address, ""will not wait for us.""

30,1914970836.xml,"Armed doctor kills himself, 1 other at NYC hospital; 6 hurt  PARIS -- A doctor who was forced out from a New York hospital because of sexual harassment accusations returned Friday with an assault weapon hidden under a lab coat and shot seven people, killing one woman in an attack that left several doctors fighting for their lives, authorities said.The gunman, Dr. Henry Bello, fatally shot himself after trying to set himself on fire at Bronx- Lebanon Hospital, they said. He staggered, bleeding, into a hallway where he collapsed and died with the rifle at his side, officials said.Witnesses described a chaotic scene as gunfire erupted, spreading terror throughout the facility, as employees locked themselves inside rooms and patients feared for their lives. ""I thought I was going to die,"" said Renaldo Del Villar, 55, a patient who was in an emergency room getting treatment for a lower back injury.Law enforcement officials identified the shooter as Bello, 45, who was described on the hospital website as a family medicine physician. Officials said Bello used an AR-15 in the attack on the 16th and 17th floors.One female doctor was killed and six others wounded -- five seriously, said Police Commissioner James O'Neill. The patients were treated in the emergency room.Bello was allowed to resign from the hospital in 2015 amid sexual harassment allegations, according to law enforcement officials. In unrelated cases, he was arrested in 2004 on a charge of sexual abuse, according to a police report. He was arrested again in 2009 on a charge of unlawful surveillance, after two women said he tried to look up their skirts with a mirror.The 120-year-old hospital is one of the busiest emergency rooms in the city. 22 of Trump's aides earn at least $179,700, White House reportsWASHINGTON -- More than 40 percent of White House staffers earn in excess of $100,000 a year, according to new salary details released Friday.A White House staff salary document shows that 22 of Trump's aides are earning $179,700. They include chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway.Also making $179,000: Omarosa Manigault, the former ""Apprentice"" contestant who serves as director of communications for the White House office of public liaison.Among those forgoing pay are Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.The White House has been required to report the salaries and staff titles to Congress every year since 1995. U.N. agrees to cut peacekeeping budget, a reduction U.S. soughtUNITED NATIONS -- The General Assembly on Friday agreed to a significant cut in the budget for the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping missions, a reduction that the Trump administration fought hard to achieve though it wanted an even larger decrease.After heated negotiations, the assembly's budget committee agreed to a $7.3 billion budget for 14 peacekeeping missions for the year starting Saturday, a $570 million cut from the current budget of $7.87 billion.The 193-member world body voted by consensus to approve $6.8 billion. It also agreed to an additional $500 million for two missions that are in the throes of downsizing -- the joint U.N.-African Union mission in Sudan's troubled western Darfur region and the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti. White House panel on voting fraud asks states for voter dataSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- President Donald Trump's commission investigating alleged voter fraud in the 2016 elections has asked states for a list of the names, party affiliations, addresses and voting histories of all voters, if state law allows it to be public.A Wednesday letter from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity gives secretaries of state about two weeks to provide the voter data. That also would include dates of birth, the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers and any information about felony convictions and military status.Some officials, including Virginia's governor and the secretaries of state in California and Kentucky, refused to comply, saying the request invades privacy and is based on false claims of fraud. German lawmakers vote to legalize gay marriageBERLIN -- German lawmakers voted Friday to legalize same-sex marriage, a move widely supported across the country that brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers.Chancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.Lawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize ""marriage for everybody,"" with four abstentions.Underlining the delicate political tightrope that Merkel walked, the ""no"" votes came entirely from her conservative bloc, although some prominent party members voted for it.""This is a historic day,"" said Greens lawmaker Volker Beck, who leapt to his feet to applaud once the result was announced and was showered with confetti by supporters. San Antonio officer dies of head wound after shootoutSAN ANTONIO -- A police officer in San Antonio died Friday of wounds suffered when he and his partner were shot by a man they intended to question about a vehicle break-in, police said.Officer Miguel Moreno, a nine-year veteran of the police force, was shot in the head during the encounter with the man Thursday.The gunman fired on Moreno and partner Julio Cavazos as they stepped out of their patrol car. Police have not released the name of the gunman. Cavazos also was shot but returned fire and attempted to pull Moreno out of the line of fire.Cavazos underwent surgery and is expected to recover, police Chief William McManus said Friday. ""I'm at a loss to describe what a tragedy this is,"" he said.The gunman died in the shootout. Four Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa plan to shutter Friday, following then-Gov. Terry Branstad's approval of a budget in May that stripped it of its Medicaid funding. The organization is also planning to close six clinics in Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming over concerns of political attacks, officials said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is giving the military chiefs another six months before they begin allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services. The delay does not affect troops already in the military. Mattis' decision Friday endorses a pact hammered out last week by the heads of the four branches.CAPTION: Photo: Chinese leader Xi Jinping rides past soldiers on an airstrip as he inspects troops Friday in Hong Kong.

31,1413407349.xml,"       For Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, the tangible signs of Greece's recovery are the tourists pouring into Athens from cruise ships and airplanes. Olympia Angeli says she's lucky those tourists keep her employed. The 28-year-old is clinging to the security of working as a waitress even as her wages have fallen by half in three years. Nor does she know when she can return to her studies in tourism management: She can't afford to lose her $650 monthly take-home salary, needed to support her aging parents.    ""A lot of people moved back home because of the crisis so their parents could support them,"" she said in the historical neighborhood of Plaka at the foot of the Acropolis. ""But I'm an only child, and I never moved out. I support my parents, help pay the rent, help look after them.""    Not becoming one of the 1.3 million people out of work is an abiding concern for the 3.6 million Greeks holding a job in the sixth year of the slump, now being called one of the deepest peacetime recessions of any industrialized economy. Gross domestic product has dropped 22 percent since 2008.    The ancient marble streets and squares of Athens, many now inhabited by beggars and once converged on by angry protesters, show the price citizens are paying for their leaders' policy mistakes. Even as exports rise in Italy, Portugal and Spain and investment by U.S. companies returns to Ireland, Greece remains the poster child for the euro's three-year existential struggle.    ""Greece has the holy trinity of crises,"" said Andreas Koutras, an adviser at the Lucerne, Switzerland-based investment company SteppenWolf Capital LLC, an investment fund that holds Greek debt. ""It has a public debt crisis, a bank crisis and a cultural-political crisis. These are self-feeding. Greece has become the lighthouse of Europe: Steer well clear of that area.""    While wage and pension cuts have slimmed the country's deficit, a slump in consumer confidence, a failure to tackle tax collection and a 2013 debt burden that the International Monetary Fund says will hit 175 percent of gross domestic product are keeping up the pressure.    A state-asset sales plan underpinning $319 billion in pledged aid has been repeatedly overhauled as buyers fail to appear, even after German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to prevent a euro exit.    The International Monetary Fund and European Union program for Greece has left the country on a different trajectory than those of Ireland or Portugal, Bruegel, a Brussels-based research institute, said in a May report. It compared the effectiveness of the loans-for-austerity policies imposed on the three euro-area nations.    ""The Greek program may still achieve its ultimate goal of keeping Greece in the euro area and of making it able to recover and grow,"" the report said.    The IMF and the EU ""have had to commit many more resources and for a much longer period than initially envisaged, and results remain deeply disappointing and the ultimate outcome uncertain.""  'Starting to dawn'    The unemployment rate of 27.4 percent is more than double that when Greece started receiving the first installments of its international bailout in May 2010, jeopardizing the gains made retooling an economy that plunged Europe into the debt crisis. The rate will be 21 percent by 2016, according to an IMF forecast published June 5.    Angeli said she stuck with waiting tables to avoid joining the people who ended up leaving the country to find work.    ""I could have left two years ago with a friend who went to the U.K.,"" Angeli said. ""She abandoned her studies here. She saw only darkness, darkness, darkness and said: 'I'm not going to drown in this.' ""    The friend got a job working in a pub on her first day in London and is planning to buy an apartment, Angeli said.    Signs of progress were visible as recently as April, when Samaras, 62, persuaded the IMF, EU and European Central Bank to release more loans. The premier declared that Greece was on the road to recovery.    ""Many say that it is darkest before the dawn,"" he said April 16, a day after the accord. ""Today we believe, more than at any other time, that it is starting to dawn.""    Borrowing costs dropped to their lowest since they were part of the biggest restructuring in history in March 2012, and the Athens Stock Exchange soared 142 percent from its June 2012 low to a high of 1,152.60 on May 17.    Then everything unraveled. In June, the country failed to draw bids for the sale of national gas company Depa, punching a new hole in finances. Samaras' decision to shut the national broadcaster to reduce the state payroll backfired when coalition partner Democratic Left quit the government in protest, raising the specter of early elections that polls show would be as inconclusive as last year's.    The party that continues to make inroads is the anti-immigration Golden Dawn, with its red, white and black flags reminiscent of Nazi swastikas, and food parcels only for those of Greek blood.    Even an agreement by European governments to parcel out funds, including $3.3 billion in July, hasn't kept the stock index from becoming the worst performer this year among 18 Western European markets. Greece's benchmark 10-year bond yield -- it has decreased from a 2013 high of 13.04 percent March 27 and was as low as 8.10 percent May 22 -- was 10.67 percent on July 12.    The government is struggling to make everyone pay their fair share in taxes.    The tax crimes squad conducted 841 checks June 21-24 on companies in tourist areas including Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes and Skopelos.    Of that number, 381 were found to be breaking tax rules for a total of 822 infringements, such as not issuing receipts, not paying sales tax, not registering visitors at hotels or not registering employees.  Debt size worrisome    Even after restructuring, Greece's debt will only fall to 124 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the IMF June report. The country owes 318 billion euros ($422.5 billion), mostly to the IMF and euro-area taxpayers, Alternate Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said July 3.    ""I don't see any change at all in the sheer size of the debt,"" said Bruce Stout, manager of the $2.3 billion Murray International Trust at Aberdeen Asset Management in Edinburgh, Scotland, and a visitor to Crete this year. ""For a generation, it's all they've ever known: debt.""    That's not obvious to the Germans, Italians, Americans and Australians milling about the New Acropolis Museum, across the street from where Angeli works. On a recent day, street entertainers in shorts and beanies break-danced on the walkway.    Not far away, there are graffiti-scrawled neighborhoods, where Greeks and others sleep in the doorways of banks and stores.    Similarly, the airport buses disgorging tourists onto the streets of the main Syntagma Square opposite Parliament are often greeted by beggars crouched on the edge of sidewalks, hands outstretched.    Angeli, who lives in a rented apartment with her parents, says she turned down her first offer of a university place studying history at Ionian University because ""history doesn't put food on the table.""    Angeli considers herself lucky because she has managed to support herself throughout the crisis even ""as businesses shut down one after the other."" She is hopeful that she can return to finish her degree so she can open her own business or at least move up to managing one.    ""It's not total darkness; there's a dawn, maybe,"" she said before heading back to work. ""But it's still really far in the distance. It's taking a long time.""

32,1888885170.xml,"Turkey's steady march toward dictatorship just went into full gallop. Voters on Sunday narrowly approved a raft of constitutional changes that shift even more power to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who already maintains an iron grip over his country. Beginning in 2019, the post of prime minister will disappear, and Erdogan can make Cabinet appointments without any parliamentary oversight. His control over the country's judiciary will expand. He can also dissolve parliament at any time, for any reason. And, starting with the 2019 elections, Erdogan, who took power as prime minister in 2003, can run for two more five-year terms.Erdogan's margin of victory was razor-thin, and there were strong indications that the vote was far from fair. International election observers criticized the decision by Turkish election officials to allow as valid more than a million ballots that had been cast without an official stamp. Without the stamp, authorities can't be sure those ballots aren't fraudulent. During the campaign, authorities arrested a leading opposition politician campaigning against the ""Yes"" movement and cracked down on journalists critical of the referendum.An undemocratic election shouldn't surprise anyone, given Erdogan's track record for authoritarian governance. After a failed coup attempt, his government arrested more than 40,000 perceived opponents of the regime and purged more than 100,000 from their government jobs. Erdogan blamed the coup attempt on his primary political rival, Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who once was a close Erdogan ally and who now lives in Pennsylvania. Washington has rejected Ankara's requests for Gulen's extradition, saying Turkey must convince U.S. courts that there's enough evidence to charge Gulen with a crime.So far, the West has reacted to the election with measured criticism. The State Department said irregularities on the day of the election and the run-up to it led to an ""uneven playing field"" in favor of the ""Yes"" movement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the close vote reflected the deep divisions within Turkish society, and she urged Erdogan loyalists and opposition leaders to talk out their differences.If Western leaders choose their words carefully about Turkey, it's because they have to. Turkey is a NATO member integral to the fight against Islamic State in Syria. It allows the U.S. to use an air base at Incirlik for its airstrikes and drone flights into Syria. It also has provided haven to more than 3 million Syrian refugees and has a deal with European leaders to keep refugees from traveling on to Europe.But if Turkey is going to fulfill its decadeslong goal to join the European Union, it needs Western backing. Expecting Erdogan to reform isn't realistic, but that doesn't mean Europe should compromise its principles for EU inclusion. Those principles require EU applicant nations to maintain ""stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights ....""Turkey is veering away from--rather than approaching--those principles. Erdogan also has been talking about holding a referendum on the reinstatement of the death penalty, which would nix the country's bid for EU membership.Erdogan can't have it both ways. He can't run roughshod over democratic principles and then expect the EU to welcome Turkey, no questions asked. Turkey's too valuable in the fight against Islamic State to treat like a pariah. But it's not so valuable that the European community should abandon core ideals it applies to other countries that join.",2017-04-18
33,1706018937.xml,"       Greece's main opposition party launched efforts to form a new government Friday following Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' resignation, but made no progress in what appears a doomed task -- which will pave the way for another potentially destabilizing election. Tsipras resigned late Thursday and called an early election next month to deal with a rebellion in his radical left Syriza party over the terms of Greece's new bailout deal.   Although no date has been set, outgoing government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said Friday she expects Greeks will go to the polls Sept. 20.   The opposition has few chances of uniting and forming a government and Tsipras is widely tipped to win the vote, though if he fails to secure an outright majority he could have to seek a new coalition.   His decision to call a vote so early -- just hours after Greece started tapping loans from its $95 billion rescue program -- amounts to a bet that he can regain power with a new government that would not be hobbled by internal dissent.   The rebels announced Friday they were splitting to form their own anti-austerity movement.   They want to scrap the bailout altogether, arguing that the budget savings and reforms Tsipras agreed to for the bailout are exactly what they had vowed to fight when they came to power with Syriza in January.   About 1 in 4 Syriza lawmakers refused to back the bailout's ratification in parliament last week, which was only approved with backing from opposition parties. Faced with such dissent, it became only a matter of time before Tsipras called an election or confidence vote to confirm his mandate to implement the bailout reforms.   It will be the third time this year that Greeks vote, after January elections and a July 5 referendum on reforms that creditors were proposing during bailout negotiations.   Some analysts are concerned that the election could delay reforms needed to get rescue loans, which are only disbursed after quarterly reviews.   But, at least so far, Greece's European creditors seemed sanguine about the election, which had been widely expected.   ""The step by Prime Minister Tsipras isn't surprising"" considering he has lost his majority in parliament, said Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He noted that the bailout deal was signed with Greece, and not just the current government, meaning it should be implemented by whoever emerges victorious from the election.   In Brussels, European Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said the European Union executive body was confident the bailout program would be implemented.   The political uncertainty nevertheless took its toll on Greece's stock market, with the main stock index closing down 2.5 percent, a day after losing 3.5 percent on election speculation.   On Friday, President Prokopis Pavlopoulos met conservative New Democracy party head Evangelos Meimarakis and asked him to try to form a government.   Meimarakis later met with the head of the small, centrist Potami party, Stavros Theodorakis, who said the best way forward for Greece was to hold elections as soon as possible.   ""The way things are now ... we believe it is impossible for this parliament to produce a government,"" Theodorakis said after the meeting.   Meimarakis has three days to seek coalition partners, after which the mandate would be given to the third-largest party in Parliament for a further three days.   The third-largest party is now the new movement formed by the 25 lawmakers who split from Syriza on Friday. The group, Popular Unity, will be led by former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis.   If, as expected, neither attempt bears fruit, parliament will be dissolved and a caretaker government appointed to lead the country to early elections within a month.

34,1851052881.xml,"       German officials had deemed the Tunisian man being sought in a manhunt across Europe a threat long before a truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin -- and even kept him under covert surveillance for six months this year before halting the operation. Now the international manhunt for Anis Amri -- considered the prime suspect in Monday's deadly rampage -- is raising questions about how closely German authorities are monitoring the hundreds of known Islamic extremists in the country.   The issue puts new pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is running for re-election next year. Critics are lambasting her for allowing hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers to enter the country, allegedly without proper security checks.   Among them was Amri, a convicted criminal in Tunisia and Italy with little chance of getting asylum who successfully evaded deportation from Germany even as German authorities rejected his asylum application and deemed the 24-year-old man a possible jihadi threat.   He is suspected in the attack that left 12 people dead and 48 injured Monday in Berlin. Health officials said 12 of the injured had serious wounds.   After German media published photos of him and a partial name, federal prosecutors issued a public appeal for information along with the promise of a $105,000 reward for his arrest.   Within hours it emerged that the man authorities warned could be ""violent and armed"" had been known to them for months as someone with ties to Islamic extremists who used at least six different names and three different nationalities.   ""People are rightly outraged and anxious that such a person can walk around here, keep changing his identity and the legal system can't cope with them,"" said Rainer Wendt, head of a union representing German police.   Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump declared that the deadly truck attack in Berlin was ""an attack on humanity and it's got to be stopped."" He also suggested to reporters that he might go forward with his campaign pledge to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from coming to the United States.   ""All along, I've been proven to be right,"" Trump said when asked if the attack in Berlin had caused him to re-evaluate the proposal. ""What's happening is disgraceful.""   German authorities had initially focused their investigation on a Pakistani man detained shortly after the attack, but released him for lack of evidence. After finding documents belonging to Amri in the cab of the truck, they issued a notice to other European countries Wednesday seeking his arrest.   According to Ralf Jaeger, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, Amri arrived in Germany in July 2015 as the influx of asylum-seekers was nearing its peak.   Although registered in the west of the country, Amri had moved around Germany regularly since February, living mostly in Berlin, said Jaeger.   Within months of his arrival, authorities had added Amri to a growing list of potentially violent Islamic extremists, not all of them asylum-seekers.   State prosecutors in Berlin even launched an investigation of Amri on March 14 following a tip from federal security agencies, who warned that he might be planning a break-in to finance the purchase of automatic weapons.   Surveillance showed that Amri did deal drugs in a Berlin park and was in a bar brawl, but no evidence was found to substantiate the original warning.   The surveillance measures were called off in September, by which time Amri had disappeared from his regular haunts in Berlin, prosecutors said.   Separately, Amri's asylum application was rejected in July. German authorities prepared to deport him but weren't able to do so because he didn't have valid identity papers, Jaeger said. In August they started trying to get him a replacement passport.   ""Tunisia at first denied that this person was its citizen, and the papers weren't issued for a long time,"" Jaeger said. ""They arrived today.""   It wasn't clear whether Germany was aware of Amri's previous brushes with the law, both in his homeland and in Italy, where he lived until last year. Tunisia's Mosaique FM radio reported that he was sentenced to several years in prison in both countries for violent crimes.   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that Amri was ordered expelled after his prison time in Italy. However, Tunisian authorities didn't finish all the paperwork in the required time, so Amri never was sent back to Tunisia, it reported.   German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere cautioned that he was ""a suspect, not necessarily the perpetrator.""   ""We are still investigating in all directions,"" he said.

35,1783859393.xml,"       In London, it was a sight with long historical precedent: an American president and a British prime minister showing personal rapport as they tended to the long-running ""special relationship"" between their countries. ""I've always found (President Barack Obama) someone who gives sage advice,"" said David Cameron, the conservative prime minister. ""He's a man with a very good heart and been a very good friend.""    At a joint news conference, Cameron and Obama reminisced about basketball, table tennis and barbecues; a day later, the pair agonized over their misfortune on the golf course.    Here in Hanover on Sunday, a different scene emerged as German Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked to recount the ups and downs of her time with Obama.    ""We're actually quite busy with the conflicts that we need to solve in the world,"" she said, brushing off the question. ""I am not in position to take stock today.""    Obama's bond with Merkel often has seemed as transactional as the one with Cameron is chummy. But with Merkel being the only leader of a major ally whose tenure has spanned Obama's presidency, aides say they share a deep bond that has allowed them to weather domestic and global storms, and even clashes with each other.    ""This is as important a relationship as I've had during the course of my presidency,"" Obama said Sunday, describing Merkel as consistent, steady and trustworthy.    They may not demonstrate overt personal chemistry, but, in some ways, according to a senior administration official, they are more compatible than Obama is with other leaders. Both are cool, deliberate and interested in finding solutions.    As Merkel responded in detail to a question about resolving the Syria quagmire Sunday, Obama at one point looked at her admiringly and nodded vigorously at the argument she made.    In an interview with the German newspaper Bild published prior to his arrival, Obama said that he has learned from Merkel over the years and that she embodies the leadership qualities he admires most, particularly her pragmatism.    ""When she says something, she means it. When she says she'll do something, she does it,"" he said. ""I trust her. And when there have been bumps in the bilateral relationship, as there inevitably are between any two countries, we've worked through them together as partners, with mutual respect.""    That Merkel invited Obama for his fifth visit suggests strains have eased since the dark days of October 2013, when leaks from fugitive Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had been eavesdropping on Merkel's telephone calls for at least three years.    Merkel was furious and Obama, who was embarrassed, later said he had ended the intelligence gathering operation.    Merkel had her doubts about Obama early on, at least according to comments attributed to a former U.S. ambassador to Germany that were related to Hillary Clinton by Sidney Blumenthal.    ""She dislikes the atmospherics surrounding the Obama phenomenon, that it's contrary to her whole idea of politics and how to conduct oneself in general,"" Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton confidant, wrote in an email made public by the State Department last year.    But the two leaders quickly found common ground.    As head of Europe's largest and most stable economy, Merkel was an essential partner in Obama's efforts to help steady the global economy after the recession. The administration also worked closely with Germany on emerging security threats.    Merkel now is eyeing Obama to buttress her political standing after fallout from the Syrian refugee crisis cost her party in recent regional elections. Before Obama left Washington, the White House flatly said the president wanted ""to provide political support to her."" He did that Sunday at their news conference, responding to her critics.    ""She is on the right side of history on this,"" Obama said. ""She is giving voice I think to the kinds of principles that bring people together rather than divide them, and I'm very proud of her for that, and I'm proud of the German people for that.""    During his two-day visit, Obama and Merkel will be joined by Cameron, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for talks on developments in Syria, the migration crisis and joint operations against Islamic State and other terrorist groups.    ----------   mmemoli@tribune.com Credit: By Michael A.

36,1431282710.xml,"       With tensions over Syria defused, at least for the moment, calm has  returned to the stock market as well as to individuals worried  about military engagement and the price of gasoline. But analysts are warning investors not to become too comfortable.  Even before President Barak Obama began talking about a military  attack on Syria, analysts were preparing investors for ominous  dates on political calendars for both the U.S. and Europe this  fall. Independent of geopolitical issues in the Mideast, political  decisions later this month and next have the potential of  unsettling stock and bond markets.  At issue in the U.S. is the possible replay of the nation's debt  ceiling debate. The country once again is approaching the point  where Congress must decide if it will lift restrictions on the  federal government's level of debt so the nation can pay its bills.  The expectation is that the deadline will arrive at the end of  October.  In addition, there's the possibility of a partial government  shutdown if lawmakers don't extend the nation's authority to spend  after the old authority expires Sept. 30.  In 2011, the fight over extending the debt ceiling became so  contentious that the stock market plunged as American politicians  seemed incapable of making decisions and Standard & Poor's lowered  the nation's credit rating. Political paralysis in Washington hit  at the same time the eurozone appeared poised for collapse -- a  nasty combination that shook confidence as businesses and consumers  looked for leadership strength amid global financial weakness.  Analysts expect bitter fighting in Washington to erupt again as the  debt debate approaches deadlines. Yet, analysts also assume --  based on last-minute deals over the nation's debt during the last  two years -- that ultimately a deal will be forged, the federal  government will avoid a shutdown and the nation's debts will be  paid without sending a chill through the bond market.  Although the posturing in the debate could cause a stock market  downturn temporarily, analysts expect the impact to be short-lived.  Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent report to  clients that markets might not respond to the debate at first  because investors have been ""somewhat desensitized"" by bickering  and last-minute decisions in the past. But close to the deadline,  there could be ""short-lived volatility"" that would end with an  agreement.  In the months ahead, the political scene in Europe could have more  of a long-term impact on the global economy and markets. There,  Italy's leadership is in flux and the kingpin of the eurozone,  Germany, faces an election Sept. 22. Since the dark days of 2011  and 2012, optimism about Europe's future has lifted primarily  because the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi,  promised to do whatever it takes to keep the euro intact. Recently,  some economic data has also shown signs that Europe is emerging  from recession.  Still, some European banks and Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy  are still in distress. Germany, with a strong economy, has been the  key to bailouts up to this point and will be in the future.  The most powerful person in those decisions, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel, is up for election. The popular notion has been that  once Merkel's election is behind her, she will no longer need to  worry about infuriating voters by helping countries on Europe's  periphery.  With that freedom she presumably will become more lenient about  demanding weak countries adopt austerity measures and will be more  generous with bailouts -- paving the way for a European recovery.  For example, David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors, which  manages more than $2.3 billion, recently wrote clients: ""The  European Central Bank (ECB) is destined to be expansive as soon as  it gets through the uncertainty occasioned by the German federal  election on September 22 and the German Constitutional Court ruling  on the ECB's bond-buying program.""  That widespread belief, along with some stronger data on Europe's  distressed economy, has helped propel the European Stoxx 600 index  up almost 11 percent this year.  While most analysts think Merkel is bound to win the election, some  claim there are no assurances the troubled parts of Europe will get  what they want as 17 nations grapple with unpopular assistance for  other countries.  ""Germany must lend, give and spend with abandon to save the euro,""  Lombard Street Research economist Brian Reading said in a recent  note. He thinks International Monetary Fund forecasts of the costs  and the ability of heavily indebted European countries to grow  their way out of trouble are wildly optimistic.  Most analysts, he said, ""have lost sight of the debt-trap  arithmetic."" And without extraordinary help from Germany, he  expects the ""euro is in a hospice.""  While an unexpected loss for Merkel in the election would rattle  investors, Europe's longer-term problems will not be immediately  apparent.  Citigroup global political economist Tina Fordham said that  regardless of the German election this month, ""investors should not  expect significant changes to Berlin's austerity policy"" as public  support for national leaders is weak.  ""Governance challenges may lie ahead for the eurozone for some  years to come,"" she said.  ---------- gmarksjarvis@tribune.com  Twitter @gailmarksjarvis Caption: Graphic: CBOE Volatility IndexDaily closesTuesday close: 14.532011-2013SOURCE: Bloomberg TRIBUNE- See microfilm for complete graphic  ",2013-09-11
37,1644442725.xml,"       Democrats draft plan to benefit middle class Senior Democrats, dissatisfied with the party's tepid prescriptions for combating income inequality, are drafting an ""action plan"" that calls for a massive transfer of wealth from the superrich and Wall Street traders to the heart of the middle class.   The centerpiece of the proposal, set to be unveiled Monday by Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., is a ""paycheck bonus credit"" that would shave $2,000 a year off the tax bills of couples earning less than $200,000. Other provisions would nearly triple the tax credit for child care and reward people who save at least $500 a year.   The windfall, about $1.2 trillion over a decade, would come directly from the pockets of Wall Street ""high rollers"" through a new fee on financial transactions, and from the top 1 percent of earners, who would lose billions of dollars in lucrative tax breaks.   The plan also would use the tax code to prod employers to boost wages, which have been stagnant for four decades despite gains in productivity and corporate profits.   With Republicans in control on Capitol Hill, Democrats have little hope of pushing the plan through Congress. Instead, they are trying to craft an alternative to GOP plans to cut tax rates for the top earners while shaping a 2016 campaign agenda that offers voters the promise of change.   The plan marks a rejection of the more cautious approach to economic policy taken last year by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders.  Haiti leader, Parliament try to resolve standoff   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Haiti's leader and opposition lawmakers are locked in negotiations, trying to forge a last-minute deal to resolve a standoff stalling elections in the troubled country.   President Michel Martelly and opposition officials have been embroiled in a showdown over legislative elections. On Sunday, they again met behind closed doors at a Port-au-Prince hotel trying to end the impasse a day before Parliament is dissolved. Martelly will rule by decree if they don't resolve the political crisis by the end of Monday.  59 people dead after bus, tanker crash in Pakistan   PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- An oil tanker collided with a bus in southern Pakistan's Sindh province Sunday, leaving 59 people dead, police and hospital sources said.

38,2128548794.xml,"Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has decided to retire, a development that is profound not only for her nation but also for Europe. There are also significant international implications.
On Oct. 29, Chancellor Merkel announced she will step down as leader of her party in December and will not run for re-election in 2021. Her preferred successor is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who would continue on a moderate course. However, the Chancellor and her party have suffered major election defeats and growing political pressures beyond election results.
Chancellor Merkel has been leading her nation with a Grand Coalition involving her own conservative CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union) and the SPD (Social Democratic Party) on the left. The latter is a party with historic roots in the socialist movement, but today without traditional emphasis on nationalization of industry or economic class struggles.
Parliamentary elections in September 2017 were a setback for the governing parties. The far-right nationalist AfD (Alternative for Germany) Party made significant gains, winning 94 Bundestag seats with over 12 percent of the vote. The Bundestag, the lower house of the national legislature, forms the government.
The AfD had no seats in the previous parliament. This marked the first time this type of extreme party won parliamentary representation since World War II.
The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) lost all Bundestag seats in the parliamentary elections held in September 2013, a devastating defeat. In 2017, the party won 80 seats and could be part of a future coalition government, as in the past. The left environmentalist Green Party won 67 seats, a gain of four, and could be a future governing partner.
After the 2017 election, Chancellor Merkel reassembled the Grand Coalition. This is the fourth time since World War II such a major-party partnership has governed.
In the 2013 elections, the powerful CDU/CSU elected the most members of parliament, but fell five seats short of a clear majority. Decimation of the FDP, which had been a governing coalition partner, led to the formation of the Grand Coalition.
The decline of the major parties reflects a broad long-term trend in European politics. Political parties traditionally strongly reflected economic class, religion and regional interests and sentiments. With the growth of post-World War II economic prosperity, economic class frictions and associated ideologies including socialism have generally declined, along with nationalism. Religion is also fading in political importance in secular Europe.
Regional sensibilities have generally grown, in some cases with dramatic public and political impacts. The rise of the Scottish National Party in Britain is one example. Political turmoil in Catalonia in Spain illustrates the same trends, including the dangers of violence.
The European Coal and Steel Community, predecessor of the European Union of today, began soon after World War II. Economic integration intentionally became a policy instrument to encourage political stability and peace. In consequence, no single nation dominates Europe today.
There is no reason for alarm if the pace of finding Angela Merkel’s successor is slow. Modern German politics is deliberate and almost studiedly pragmatic.
Germany led by Chancellor Merkel provides an outstanding example of fiscal discipline and prudence, effective military collaboration in NATO, and humanitarian relief for refugees fleeing wars elsewhere.
Her successor will have the advantage of a stable democratic base on which to operate. There will also be the major challenge of equaling the record of this extraordinary leader.

39,2118809768.xml,"Late last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey held discussions in Berlin. Command of two of the most effective militaries in Europe and the world is one reason this mini-summit has maximum importance. The two nations were allies until after World War I.
Skillful non-military Merkel displayed courage and effectiveness in the discussions, unintentionally aided by autocrat Erdogan. She reminded him publicly of human rights abuses in Turkey, the proper stance.
Turkey remains an important military ally. Earlier this year, the United States military put combat operations in eastern Syria directed against ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria) on hold. This was in response to Turkey moving directly against Kurd separatists operating in the same area.
Turkey several years ago shifted to participate much more aggressively in the international coalition fighting ISIS. Their military began to strike the enemy directly and permit the U.S.-led coalition to use air bases in Turkey.
In July 2015, an emergency North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting convened in Brussels, at Turkey’s request. The government in Ankara was concerned about terrorist incidents involving ISIS and Turkish separatists.
Allies have urged restraint in Turkey’s attacks on the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Historically, the Turkish Kurd population has contained strong separatist elements. The banned PKK is an extreme faction.
The Brussels meeting confirmed NATO solidarity and Turkey’s important role. This military dimension should be paramount regarding this alliance’s partners.
Within Turkey, since the turn of the century, the Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP), an Islam-based religious party, generally has been dominant. This complicates relations with the U.S., and other nations. However, despite strains, alliance with Turkey has essentially survived.
Turkish developments are both encouraging and challenging. Terrorist attacks in the country have boomeranged, with considerable hostility toward perpetrators of the criminal acts.
Erdogan’s dramatic direct public appeal undercut an attempted military coup in 2016. Emergency measures since are dictatorial, and human rights abuses indefensible, but elections continue.
After the revolution in the 1920s led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey became constitutionally strictly secular. The army served as watchdog.
Four times in the past half century, the generals acted. At times, military intervention was bloody. Failure of the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey shows political progress.
Turkey’s geostrategic importance is undeniable for Germany and other nations. Turkey commands sea and land shipping routes, including the Strait of Bosporus. Governments in Ankara have in the past worked effectively with Israel, and current complex strains combine with some hopeful developments.
Ankara-Washington cooperation is strongly rooted, though neglected by the current U.S. administration. Turkey has been actively engaged in Afghanistan, including major military and diplomatic responsibilities.
During the first Persian Gulf War, U.S. B-52 bombers deployed on Turkish soil, a potentially risky move by Ankara. Turkey played a vital Allied role during the Korean War; the UN military cemetery at Pusan contains a large number of Turkish graves.
German and Turkish history of military alliance should be a foundation for positive new diplomatic and economic cooperation. Under Erdogan’s erratic and flawed leadership, Turkey’s economy is in trouble. Capital is fleeing and unemployment is rising.
Germany has the largest and strongest economy in Europe, a contrast in particular to Russia’s weakness. Germany’s leadership is crucial to the European Union, and influence steadily grows elsewhere.
We should applaud Chancellor Merkel’s leadership. She is hardworking, disciplined, responsible — and successful.

40,1904826121.xml,"Germans do not seem too friendly to Americans these days.
According to a recent Harvard Kennedy School study of global media, 98 percent of German public television news portrays President Donald Trump negatively, making it by far the most anti-Trump media in the world.
Yet the disdain predates the election of Trump, who is roundly despised here for his unapologetic anti-European Union views.
In a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of European countries, Germany had the least favorable impression of America. Only about 50 percent of Germans expressed positive feelings toward the U.S. former President Barack Obama, who visited here last week to lecture the world on diversity and tolerance, never changed negative attitudes much from the unpopular George W. Bush years.
Germans apparently do not appreciate that fellow NATO member America still subsidizes their defense. Nor do they seem appreciative of their huge trade surplus ($65 billion) with the United States.
Germans seem to have forgotten that American troops for 45 years kept the Soviets from absorbing all of Germany. The Berlin Airlift is now premodern history.
Why, then, do confident Germans increasingly dislike the United States?
It is complicated.
Since 1989, Germany has worked hard on its post-unification image as a largely pacifistic country. It is eager to teach other nations how to conduct themselves peacefully and to pursue shared global goals such as reducing global warming or opening national borders to the world’s refugees.
Implicit in Germany’s utopian message is that postmodern Germans know best what not to do - given their terrible 20th century past, with the aggressions of imperial Germany and later the savagery and Holocaust perpetuated by Hitler’s Third Reich.
Yet being guilt-ridden does not equate to being humble (never a German strong suit).
The same conceit of an ethnically, linguistically and culturally uniform state that drew Germany into conflict with the U.S. (whose late entry into both World War I and World War II helped ensure German defeats) has never quite disappeared.
Instead, German condescension merely has been updated.
In international finance, Germany de facto runs the European Union on a mercantile system. It manipulates the euro as a weaker currency to swarm export markets in a way that would have been difficult with the older and higher-valued Deutsche mark.
When poorer Southern European countries bought too many German goods on easy credit only to default on paying for them, the Germans gave them informed but self-important lectures on their need for Germanic thrift and industriousness.
A similar German hubris was true of recent immigration into Europe.
Berlin often virtue-signals the world how morally superior it now is, while also searching for ways to import cheap labor. One result is German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s disastrous open-door policy of welcoming in millions of unvetted immigrants from the war-ravaged Middle East at a time of heightened worries over jihadist terrorism.
But Germany did not just flood its own country with impoverished, hard-to-assimilate newcomers. It also dictated that other European countries do the same - whether they wished to or not.
In matters of international relations and trade, Germany’s sense of superiority occasionally resulted in old-style cheating. To increase imports of Volkswagens into the U.S., the company tried to cheat emission tests to skirt expensive regulations. Germany’s Deutsche Bank was caught money-laundering the profits of Russians in Vladimir Putin’s crony cabal. And reports indicate that to convince soccer's international governing body, FIFA, to award Germany the 2006 World Cup, German officials resorted to bribery.
Germans brag about their generous social welfare state and often compare it to a supposedly cutthroat capitalist America. But Germany is quieter about shirking its NATO membership requirements for defense spending to free up cash for its own citizens - and making mega-profits from exporting pricey luxury cars to a hyper-capitalist American elite.
We should all feel gratitude to Germany for turning its undeniable talent and energies from war to peace. Its huge economy understandably makes Berlin influential in the European Union.
Yet if German haughtiness works on a dependent Europe, it certainly does not always impress a wary America.
The United States is still far larger, wealthier and more powerful, just as it was in 1918, 1945 and 1989. It does not necessarily listen to German sanctimoniousness on climate change, immigration, trade or the occasional need for the use of force.
Instead, America more or less does what it believes to be in the best interests of itself and its allies.
Germans find such American independence cowboyish and insubordinate - and believe they can teach Americans about the dangers of such misplaced chauvinism.
Americans usually ignore these weary sermons. Instead, many of them believe that whenever Germany sticks to worrying only about Germany, the world is a far safer place - both now and in the past.

41,2031280883.xml,"After 15 months in the White House, it has become clear there is no correct way for American allies to deal with President Donald Trump. And pretty much every tactic has been tried.   Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, sped down to Mar-a-Lago soon after the election, where he gamely played a round of golf. Unfortunately, it didn't win him any special consideration when Trump announced sweeping aluminum and steel tariffs earlier this year, nor did it prevent the president from embarrassing him with inopportune tweets.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain also rushed to Washington to play nice and call for a ""special relationship"" just after the election, but she too has been attacked directly on the president's Twitter feed; worse, her performance at the White House -- including a photograph holding the president's hand -- has been regularly mocked by her own compatriots ever since. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor -- too earnest and probably too horrified even to attempt to charm the American president -- set out to woo his daughter. She invited Ivanka Trump to appear at a panel discussion alongside herself and several other distinguished female politicians; the result was that the president's daughter appeared foolish and out of place.Others have given up being nice. Unable to keep up pretenses, the prime minister of Australia squabbled with Trump, who was having trouble understanding his immigration policy. That phone call ended badly: ""I have been making these calls all day,"" said the American president, ""and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous."" The president of Mexico canceled a visit, and now raises his popularity ratings by openly criticizing the American counterpart, as do most other politicians in Mexico.But now Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, has tried something more complicated. Apparently on a whim -- he didn't believe the invitation would be accepted -- he invited the president and first lady last year to a lavish celebration of Bastille Day. Now he has been rewarded with a full state dinner, plus lots of other honors, including more hand-holding, even laughing off a classic Trump dominance gesture: an attempt to brush dandruff off his suit. Yet instead of following this obsequious behavior with an obsequious request, Macron made a speech -- using lots of flattering language and lavish references to American history -- directly attacking the worldview of Trump.He called for greater efforts on climate change -- because ""there is no planet B"" -- as well as ""a more effective, accountable and results-oriented multilateralism."" He wasn't even subtle in his attack on Trump's backward-looking nostalgia and xenophobic language: ""We can choose isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism ... but that will only inflame the fears of our citizens."" And, of course, he supported the Iran deal, which Trump has railed against as recently as this week.This combination -- flattery plus direct talk -- hasn't yet been tried on Trump. The friendly gestures will appeal to his narcissism; there is a slim chance -- very, very slim -- that it might even get him to change his mind about some things. There is a greater risk that the clear opposition, even cloaked in elaborate references to Abraham Lincoln and both Roosevelts, might irk him.But the most likely result is that the American president won't pay attention to what Macron was trying to say -- indeed, that he won't even understand that he has been so openly challenged. And that may have been the point, for Macron's speech will be perfectly understood in France, in Europe, and even in the United States (at least outside the White House). It thus preserves the French president's dignity in the face of the dandruff incident. It preserves Europe's aspiration for an alliance with the America described in his speech, the America of Lincoln and both Roosevelts. It keeps the idea of trans-Atlanticism alive. And if the president can't hear any of that -- because Trump's interest in gestures and power games outweighs his interest in words -- then maybe, given the circumstances, that's OK too.----------The Washington PostAnne Applebaum is a Washington Post columnist.CAPTION: Photo: (Emmanuel Macron) MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPACREDIT: By Anne Applebaum",2018-04-27
42,1858854963.xml,"       European leaders grappled with the jolting reality of President-elect Donald Trump's skepticism of the European Union on Monday, saying they might have to stand without the United States at their side during the Trump presidency. Trump said in a weekend interview with the Times of London and Germany's Bild newspaper that the 28-nation European Union was a vehicle for German interests and said that he was indifferent to the bloc's fate. He also said he was committed to European defense even as he expressed skepticism about NATO's current configuration.     Trump's attitudes have alarmed Europe, which is facing a wave of elections this year in which anti-immigrant, Euroskeptic leaders could gain in power. Most mainstream leaders had committed to working with Trump after his inauguration Jan. 20, even as they expressed hope that he would moderate his views once he took office.     His hard line has created the grim realization in Europe that they may now have to stand alone, without their oldest, strongest partner.     ""We Europeans have our destiny in our own hands,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. She pledged to work with Trump whenever it would be possible.     The full ramifications of a breakdown in transatlantic relations are so extensive they are difficult to total. U.S. guarantees underpin European security. The United States and the European Union, with a population of 500 million, are each other's most important trading partner. For decades, European nations and the United States have worked tightly together on issues of war, peace and trade.     Trump's comments ""caused astonishment and excitement, not just in Brussels,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters in Brussels on Monday, where he was gathering with other European foreign ministers at a previously scheduled meeting. Coming directly from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Steinmeier said NATO had listened to Trump's comments ""with concern.""     The incoming U.S. president is the first American leader since World War II not to support European integration. The European Union has long been considered to be in the U.S. interest, because it created a unified market for U.S. businesses, provided a bulwark against communism during the Cold War and helped quell the bloody slaughter that cost U.S. lives, among others, in the first half of the 20th century.     After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the European Union expanded eastward into formerly communist nations, a development that leaders there say helped bring rule of law and stability as they modernized their economies.     Steinmeier said that Germany was still trying to assess what U.S. foreign policy will be.     For example, James Mattis, the retired general nominated to be Trump's defense secretary, offered straightforward support for NATO and skepticism of Russia at his confirmation hearing last week.     ""We have to see what will come out for American policy,"" Steinmeier said.     French leaders also appeared to be scrambling to handle the fallout. Trump allies have expressed support for the anti-EU, anti-immigrant National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, is doing well in opinion polls. Le Pen lunched in the basement of Trump Tower last week in the company of a man who has served as an informal conduit for Trump's contacts with Euroskeptic leaders on the continent, although the Trump transition team denied any formal meeting.     ""The best response is European unity,"" said French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. ""As with the case of Brexit, the best way to defend Europe is to remain united.""     Only one leader appeared to embrace Trump's comments, and that was British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who said he welcomed Trump's vow to negotiate a speedy trade deal between the United States and Britain. British trade relationships are in limbo as it negotiates its exit from the European Union.     The Times of London was represented at the interview by Michael Gove, a journalist-turned-politician who was also a Brexit campaigner. ""People want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave,"" Trump said of the European Union. ""Personally, I don't think it matters much for the United States.""

43,1013912924.xml,"      Fear for the health of Greece's banks increased Wednesday after a  rush of withdrawals as the country braces for fresh elections that  could determine whether it remains part of the eurozone. Reports that depositors pulled out nearly $1 billion on a single  day fueled warnings this week from the Greek president of a run on  already shaky financial institutions. One analyst said a panic  could easily be sparked in the country's febrile political and  economic environment.  ""We're two ticks away from a run on banks,"" said Jason Manopoulos,  a leading hedge fund manager. ""If people were worried before,  they're getting scared now.""  The feeling of a society teetering on the edge of disaster was  precipitated by inconclusive elections May 6 that produced Greece's  most fractured political landscape in decades.  No party won overall control, but a strong majority of voters  backed anti-austerity parties, including the hard-left Syriza,  which has sent shock waves through the global markets with its  pledge to shred the bailout agreements that have kept Greece afloat  financially.  With the parties unable to agree on forming a unity government,  Greece on Wednesday named an emergency prime minister, Senior Judge  Panagiotis Pikramenos, who will preside over a caretaker  administration until crisis-weary voters go to the polls for a  second time June 17.  The new elections are being increasingly cast as a referendum on  whether the country should -- or can -- stay a member of the  eurozone, the 17 nations that use the euro. Senior European  officials have warned that a new government bent on turning its  back on the country's bailout obligations would basically hasten a  Greek exit from the currency union.  But there were signs that some European leaders might be trying to  soften the hard line on Greece and the recent flurry of comments  out of Brussels, Berlin and other capitals that expelling it from  the eurozone would be manageable.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the person many Greeks blame for  their problems because of her insistence on harsh austerity as the  answer to Europe's debt crisis, said in an interview with CNBC that  she had ""the will, the determination, to keep Greece in the  eurozone.""  President Karolos Papoulias told squabbling political leaders  Tuesday that about $900 million had been taken out of the banks the  day before.  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Anthee Carassava and Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Carassava reported from Athens and Chu from London.

44,419696026.xml,"         The last few weeks have been a roller coaster ride for Turkey's European Union aspirations.    On the first day of his visit to this overwhelmingly Muslim nation, Pope Benedict XVI reversed his view that Turkey didn't belong in the EU--a view expressed two years ago when he still was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger--and offered his blessing.    The next day, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, announced that it would recommend suspending accession talks with Turkey because of Ankara's long-standing refusal to open its ports and airports to Greek Cyprus, an EU member since 2004.    On Wednesday, Turkey offered to open one port and one airport to the Greek Cypriots, but only if the Greek Cypriots agreed to the same for the Turkish portion of the divided island. The EU said it would study the offer.    Next week's EU summit in Brussels could produce what EU enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn gloomily described as the slow- motion ""train wreck"" of Turkey's hopes to join the club--bad news not only for Turkey and the EU, but also for the United States, which has been an energetic cheerleader for Turkey's inclusion.    Many international relations experts believe that failure to find a way to integrate a modernizing Muslim democracy into the EU would send a negative signal to moderates across the Islamic world and to the 15 million Muslims already living within the EU. It also could encourage Turkey to reconsider its Western orientation and seek alliances elsewhere, most likely with Russia or Iran.    Former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke recently likened Turkey's importance to that of West Germany during the Cold War, calling it a ""frontline state"" that the West could ill afford to abandon.    Invited to join in 1999    The EU extended an invitation to Turkey in 1999. The process was expected to take 10 to 15 years, and few would deny that Turkey already has made huge progress toward meeting the EU's membership criteria.    But Sept. 11 happened, followed by terrorist attacks in Madrid and London. Those events widened the gulf between the West and the Islamic world.    The EU's self-confidence took a hit in 2005 when voters in France and the Netherlands rejected a new EU constitution. In the minds of many voters, the question of Turkey's membership had become conflated with fears about immigration.    Polls show that only about 1 in 3 EU residents supports Turkey's membership bid.    British Prime Minister Tony Blair says that excluding Turkey would be a ""serious mistake."" But Blair, who steps down next year, does not have to face worried voters.    Nicholas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal, the expected pairing in France's presidential elections next spring, do. Sarkozy kicked off his candidacy by declaring that ""Turkey's place is not in the EU"" and challenging Royal to match that. Royal responded that she shared the view of the French public.    German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country is home to 3 million Turks, favors a ""privileged relationship"" for Turkey, not full membership.    At times it seems that European politicians are doing everything they can to poke a sharp stick in Turkey's eye. In October, the French National Assembly passed a bill making it a criminal offense to deny the 1915 Armenian genocide.    Linking Turkey's membership to a resolution of the Cyprus dispute, and in effect giving the Greek Cypriots blackball power over Turkey's application, also seems provocative.    In 2004, when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan brokered a deal on the Cyprus question, Ankara worked hard to persuade Turkish Cypriots to support it. They did, but Greek Cypriots turned it down. The Greek side of the divided island got into the EU anyway.    ""Why is the side that said 'no' in the EU, while the side that said 'yes' is being punished?"" asked Nazlan Ertan, an Ankara journalist.    Feeling unwanted and disrespected, Turks have started to turn their backs on the EU.    A recent German Marshall Fund survey found that the percentage of Turks who saw EU membership as a good thing had fallen from 74 percent in 2004 to 54 percent today.    Wide cultural gap    Among young, self-aware Turks, there appears to be a growing sense that the cultural gap between Turkey and Europe may be too wide to bridge.    ""Economically and strategically, we are important to Europe, but culturally we are very different,"" said Merve Yildirim, an English literature student at Istanbul's Bogazici University.    ""The Ottoman Empire has a long history, and our traditions are different from the Christian world, especially in eastern Turkey,"" she said. ""Improving living standards for these people [in eastern Turkey] would be a good thing, but in some ways these are Christianized standards, and imposing them could be dangerous.""    Others, usually a bit older, remain deeply influenced by the secular, pro-Western outlook of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, modern Turkey's founder. Soban Kotukoglu, a merchant in Istanbul's bazaar, said he no longer believes the EU is crucial to Turkey's economic success but that it would be disastrous if Turkey slipped out of the West's orbit. He doesn't trust Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development party, which has Islamist roots.    ""They have two faces,"" he said, ""the one they show to the West and another one which they keep hidden, and which is much more fundamentalist.""    Turkey, straddling Europe and Asia, often seems to be looking in two directions at once.    This month Christmas lights that would put Macy's to shame are twinkling in the shopping malls of Turkey's major cities. Turkey is 99 percent Muslim, but the Christmas custom has spread rapidly in the last decade or so. Turks say they are celebrating the New Year.    Head scarves are banned in schools, universities and government offices--the result of the country's rigorously enforced secularism- -but Islamic swimwear, covering females from head to toe, made gains at the beach last summer.    Turkey produced a Nobel laureate in literature in 2006, Orhan Pamuk, but earlier, when he spoke publicly of Turkey's mistreatment of Armenians and Kurds, right-wing nationalists tried to prosecute him for ""insulting Turkishness."" The case was a reminder that Turkey still has a way to go in the human-rights department, but Meliha Altunisik, a political scientist at Ankara's Middle East Technical University, said the EU accession process had helped consolidate many reforms.    ""We have to admit that the EU anchor has been good for Turkey's democracy. It has really transformed the Turkish state,"" she said.    Ertan, the journalist, doesn't think this week's summit will produce the slow-motion train wreck predicted by Rehn and others but merely a slow train.    ""The danger with a slow train,"" she said, ""is that it might get slower and slower until it finally just stops.""    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO (color): Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party has Islamist roots, but much of the country is committed to secularism.

45,1022435470.xml,"      Here's a nightmare for Europe's leaders to ponder as they prepare  for yet another summit to tackle the eurozone crisis: a bond  auction fails in Spain, spreading solvency worries to Italy and  beyond and triggering uncontrollable bank runs that spell the  single currency's end. Is such a scenario likely? Policymakers hope not.  Is it possible? They fear it might be.  What is beyond dispute is that more economists and academics are  asking whether the euro's problems are so deep-rooted that the  currency is beyond salvation.  David Marsh, co-head of the Official Monetary and Financial  Institutions Forum for central banks and sovereign wealth funds,  likened the 13-year-old euro to a child increasingly neglected by  its parents.  ""I don't really see what's going to hold the euro up. But it's  difficult to tell the timing,"" he said.  Here are four scenarios that could destroy the eurozone:  *The new coalition government in Greece, now in its fifth year of  recession, throws up its hands and says ""no more.""  *Voters in countries that are more crucial to the single currency's  future tire of the belt-tightening demanded of them by the European  Commission and the markets.  *The Netherlands elects an anti-euro government in September.  *German Chancellor Angela Merkel feels ahead of her re-election  campaign next year that she can't ask voters to keep digging into  their pockets to underwrite Europe's underperforming southern  periphery.  And that is just in the short term. Leave aside for now the  conundrum of how eurozone laggards will restore economic  competitiveness so they can withstand the discipline imposed by a  fixed exchange rate, or how proud nation states such as France will  bring themselves to surrender sovereignty in return for getting to  use Germany's AAA credit card.  Still, the main lesson of the debt crisis is that markets  underestimate at their peril the political commitment of Europe's  leaders to do what's necessary to preserve the single currency.  ""The euro crisis is in some ways mind-bogglingly simple to solve  ... because it isn't economics, it's politics,"" said Jim O'Neill,  chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.  ""If Angela Merkel and her colleagues stood there together with the  rest of the euro area ... and if they behaved as a true union, this  crisis would be finished this weekend.""  A breakup of the single currency would plunge the euro area into a  deep recession and throw millions out of work. Germany could face a  bill running into the hundreds of billions.  It would also mark the end of six decades of ever-closer  integration aimed at cementing peace and prosperity after two world  wars.  The demise of the euro could unleash forces that chip away at other  pillars of the European Union, such as the single market and  passport-free travel.  Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Italian bank UniCredit, said  political leaders are trying to make up for procrastination by  bringing about urgent fiscal and political changes that usually  take years. But this did not imply an imminent risk of a breakdown  of the euro.  ""As I have argued ad nauseam, it's a political project, and  political leaders are unlikely to throw in the towel because  markets don't like the policies,"" he said.

46,2037933825.xml,"Thousands in Poland stand up against erosion of democracy WARSAW, Poland -- Thousands of Poles marched in Warsaw on Saturday to demand respect for their country's constitution while denouncing a populist government they accuse of eroding democracy.Many carried Polish and European Union flags during an event promoted as the ""March of Freedom"" and chanted slogans such as ""Constitution!"" and ""Free courts!""Two pro-European and centrist opposition parties, Civic Platform and Modern, were the key organizers of the protest, along with a pro-democracy civic group.In speeches, their leaders accused the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party of chipping away at democratic freedoms with an overhaul of the judicial system that gives the party vast powers over the courts.EU leaders have urged the Polish government to reverse some of the changes. The government insists it has the political mandate to reform a broken justice system.Civic Platform leader Grzegorz Schetyna said the government's opponents are fighting for ""freedom, dignity, democracy, the constitution, the independence of the Constitutional Tribunal, the independence of courts and Poland in Europe.""Some protesters held up copies of the Polish Constitution. The march was also an attempt by opposition parties to gain momentum against the ruling party ahead of local elections this fall and the parliamentary election next year.City Hall, which is controlled by Civic Platform, said 50,000 people took part. Police called that estimate high but did not give their own estimate. Merkel decries U.S. withdrawal from Iran deal, gets peace prizeASSISI, Italy -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel lamented Saturday that President Donald Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear accord was making the situation in the Middle East ""even more difficult"" and warned Europeans to be skeptical of ""easy"" solutions promised by populists.Merkel cited the recent escalation of Israeli-Iranian hostility that followed Trump's announcement about the Iran accord as a reason for concern. She said Germany was following the developments between Iran and Israel, saying that was ""yet another reason for further effort to resolve the conflict.""Merkel made her remarks at St. Francis' Basilica, in Assisi, where Franciscan friars awarded her the St. Francis Lamp for peace. She was honored for the welcome Germany gave to Syrian refugees.

47,2056346231.xml,"The German Reichstag is normally a solemn place, its walls etched with a dark history, its debates marked by an earnest sobriety.  But since the Alternative for Germany stormed into the national Parliament last fall, becoming the first far-right party to do so in more than half a century, the glass-domed chamber on the banks of the River Spree has resounded with an unexpected sound -- laughter.Not the funny kind. The derisive kind. When other parliamentarians speak, AfD members try to drown them out with coordinated cackles.""We were elected by people who want us to tell the truth,"" said Georg Pazderski, an AfD party leader. ""If (opponents) are talking nonsense, what should you do? Should you boo or should you laugh? We are laughing.""The tactic represents just one way the AfD is transforming politics in Germany, turning a system long marked by civility and stability into one characterized by point-scoring and provocation.Party members also freely hurl insults at opponents and boisterously cheer their own, giving synchronized ovations to those who use their time at the lectern to unleash attacks on the centrist government or swing debate toward their favorite topic -- contempt for immigration.To AfD stalwarts such as Pazderski, the change represents nothing less than a democratic revival, the return of ""a real opposition"" after more than a decade of cozy consensus under Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet the party's critics see something far more ominous: a coarsening of debate and the denigration of minorities in a country where that combination has ended catastrophically.Other European nations have grown accustomed to a far-right presence in their parliaments.But because of Germany's past, the AfD's emergence as a political force has been especially jarring.Rather than shy from the controversy, the party has leaned into it.Last week, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland dismissed the Nazi era as a ""speck of bird poop"" in the broader sweep of Germany's ""glorious history."" Critics said the comment was part of a pattern in which the party attempts to minimize the crimes of the Third Reich.The AfD has also drawn rebukes for adopting in debates some of the phrases and rhetorical techniques popularized by the Nazis.""Some AfD members and media refer to these discussions as 'more lively,' "" said Petra Pau, a leader of the Left party, which occupies the opposite end of Parliament's ideological spectrum. ""But they are simply more aggressive and racist.""There was the time in mid-May, when AfD co-leader Alice Weidel used a routine budget debate to denounce ""girls in headscarves, knife-wielding men on government benefits and other good-for-nothing people.""The comment prompted an official rebuke from the parliamentary president, who described it as insulting to Muslim women.But it also earned Weidel an incendiary video for the party to post on Facebook. The clip quickly racked up thousands of likes.""The AfD is trying to split society,"" the German daily Suddeutsche Zeitung concluded after reviewing 1,500 speeches delivered since this Parliament convened in late October. ""And the Bundestag is cracking.""If that was the goal, it's happened quickly.The AfD is just five years old. It got its start by capitalizing on German resentment over European bailouts for Greece. Its popularity spiked after the 2015 migration crisis, when the arrival of more than 1 million asylum-seekers in Germany spawned a backlash against the government's welcoming stance.Party leaders advocate mass deportations, question climate science and suggest Germany may have to abandon the euro in favor of a return to the German mark.In recent months, the AfD has taken on an outsized role for a party that won less than 13 percent of the vote in September elections and holds 92 seats out of the 709 in the Bundestag, the lower house of German Parliament.The Bundestag meets in the Reichstag, a building that has been burned, bombed and repeatedly reborn during its tumultuous hundred-plus-year history.The AfD's status as the largest opposition party gives its speakers the first opportunity to rebut representatives of Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union or their center-left partners, the Social Democratic Party.More important is the AfD's willingness to bend or even break unofficial rules of decorum.Personal attacks on fellow parliamentarians were long considered out of bounds. But Aydan Ozoguz, a former federal migration commissioner, has been on the receiving end of several, with AfD politicians dismissing her as ""a failed example of integration.""Ozoguz was born in Hamburg to Turkish immigrants and has been a Bundestag member for nearly a decade.""We're all prepared for confrontations that happen again and again and which previously weren't common in parliament,"" she said. ""They're often at the limits of what's legal.""When Detlef Seif, a veteran of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, attempted to deliver a speech on border security in March, he didn't get far before the insults started raining down.""Nonsense!"" ""Foolish!"" ""Impossible!""He was interrupted by AfD laughter and heckling 20 times, or an average of once every 15 seconds, according to an analysis by Suddeutsche Zeitung.""It's theater,"" Seif said in an interview.But, in his view, dangerous theater.Seif said the party uses words favored by the Nazis, including ""entartet,"" meaning ""degenerate,"" and a phrase meaning ""the dying of the German people,"" which the AfD employs to whip up fears that the country's traditional way of life is under siege from immigrants.""Those are words they're consciously using,"" Seif said. ""I can't accept that, even if they just use them to gain attention.""But what to do about it is a question that has divided the AfD's opponents.The CDU has chosen to treat the AfD as a pariah and to ignore its provocations.

The Left and the Greens, in particular, have chosen to match some of the AfD's tactics, issuing their own taunts and mocking guffaws.The behavior, said parliamentary expert Wolfgang Schroeder, was a feature of Bundestag debates in the 1980s but not since.

48,420301193.xml,"         Angela Merkel, a conservative bidding to become Germany's first female chancellor, turned to the camera earlier this month and closed a political debate by cribbing lines right out of Ronald Reagan's playbook:    ""Is our country better off than it was seven years ago?"" she said. ""Is growth higher? Is unemployment lower? Is there less bureaucracy? Are our pensions and health care system secure?""    For Germans, the answers are as obvious as they were in Reagan's America. The unemployment rate tops 11 percent, and the costly social welfare system is no longer sustainable.    Yet as voters go to the polls in Sunday's parliamentary election, one question remains: Are they ready for a change? If so, then Merkel, whose Christian Democratic Union leads in the polls, will win. If not, then the left-leaning Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democratic Party just might survive.    Merkel is a Protestant minister's daughter who was born in Hamburg, raised in the old East Germany and tutored in the ways of big-time politics by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. She is a nuts- and-bolts politician, charisma-free.    Her solutions for what ails Germany's economy appear purposely fuzzy. She has, though, proposed raising the value-added tax from 16 to 18 percent--while lowering corporate taxes. But her overarching agenda is to get Germany working again by whatever means are necessary, and to make the country economically competitive. One of Merkel's advisers floated a revolutionary plan for a 25 percent flat tax on income. The idea probably won't stick, but it signals that Merkel could be a genuine agent of change.    German-U.S. relations likely would improve under Merkel. Ties between the countries were frayed over the Iraq war--Schroeder opposed the U.S.-led invasion. He has also issued warnings about the possible use of force against Iran's nuclear enrichment program; he took that hammer off the table even as Germany, Britain and France were negotiating with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. Merkel, by contrast, wouldn't go out of her way to annoy Washington.    But don't expect Merkel to make any huge concessions to the U.S, either. She's unlikely to offer up troops for Iraq.    Merkel lacks Reagan's bedrock beliefs, not to mention his charm. Instead, she's positioning herself as a taciturn German mechanic for a country that needs a tune-up. If elected, her task is clear: Get this longtime U.S. ally back to work.  ",2005-09-15
49,1437870748.xml,"       German consumer confidence rose to its highest level in six years  heading into October, supporting expectations that strong consumer  spending will help Europe's largest economy post moderate growth in  2013. The GfK market research group said last week its forward-looking  consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of about 2,000  people, rose to 7.1 going into October from an upwardly revised 7.0  the previous month. The original September figure was 6.9, and  analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast the October reading at 7.0.  The strengthening data agreed with other recent releases suggesting  gradual but steady growth for the end of the year.  ""German consumers are expecting the economy to gain momentum in the  next few months,"" GfK said in a statement. ""There is a clear  upwards trend.""  Germans, traditionally savers, became more willing to spend in  September than at any point since December 2006, encouraged by an  essentially stable job market and historically low interest rates.  Saving appeared less attractive as inflation overtook bank interest  rates.  A subindex tracking consumers' income expectations eased, albeit  from a high level, because of rising food prices, which dampened  perceived purchasing power.  ""It's also possible that some consumers fear further financial  burdens due to the euro crisis or tax hikes,"" GfK said, referring  to the outcome of the German election, which was uncertain at the  time of the survey.  Angela Merkel's conservatives romped to victory in last month's  election, winning 42 percent of the vote, but are in need of a  coalition partner. The chancellor appeared headed toward coalition  talks with her main center-left rival Social Democrats, who had  campaigned on a platform of tax increases for Germany's  highest-wage earners.  GfK reiterated its forecast for private consumption to grow by  about 1 percent in real terms in 2013, a sign that the German  economy is on track to grow moderately this year. The Berlin-based  economic think tank DIW forecasts the economy will expand by 0.4  percent in 2013 and 1.7 percent in 2014.  The German economy, a bastion of strength in the early stages of  the eurozone crisis, shrank at the end of last year and narrowly  avoided recession this year before bouncing back.

50,1462172256.xml,"       More than two months after voters cast their ballots, Germany  took a major step toward forming a government Wednesday after  leaders of the main political parties agreed on a common agenda  that Chancellor Angela Merkel said would solidify her country's  sound financial position and promote social welfare. The deal paves the way for Merkel's conservative Christian  Democratic Union, or CDU, and its rival, the center-left Social  Democrats, to unite in a ""grand coalition"" overseeing Europe's  strongest economy.  But the political uncertainty that has prevailed since Germany's  Sept. 22 election is not entirely over. The power-sharing agreement  must be ratified by the Social Democrats' 470,000 party members,  who could yet spurn the idea of joining forces with their nemeses.  Leaders expressed hope that the fruit of their marathon  negotiations over several weeks would prove acceptable to the rank  and file on both sides. If so, that would put Merkel in her third  term as chancellor, to serve until 2017. ""The spirit of this  agreement shows that we are a grand coalition in order to deal with  the grand tasks for Germany,"" Merkel said Wednesday, listing her  priorities as ""robust finances, robust prosperity and social  security.""  The Christian Democrats were able to maintain their pledge not to  raise taxes, despite Social Democrats' demand during the campaign  that the rich pay more into the public purse. The coalition deal  also throws a sop to the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian  Social Union, by proposing a highway toll for foreigners, which  could fall afoul of European Union rules.  The Social Democrats were able to win concessions, including an  agreement to introduce a national minimum wage beginning in 2015.  Some pensions are also to be increased.  ""The grand coalition has written a coalition agreement for the  little people,"" said Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the Social  Democrats, or SPD.  Other Europeans might be disappointed by the joint agenda, which  does not include any softening of Berlin's approach to the euro  debt crisis; Merkel's party insists on continued austerity in  countries such as Greece and Portugal as the price of German  financial assistance.  Gabriel, likely to become vice chancellor in a grand coalition, is  taking a gamble with his plan to put the power-sharing deal to a  grass-roots vote.  The idea strengthened his hand in talks with the CDU, but if his  party balks, his position as chairman could be fatally weakened.  Ratification by the Social Democrats' rank and file in a December  vote is not assured.  Many are leery of teaming up with their archrivals after the last  such union during Merkel's first term as chancellor.  Voters who felt that the two parties had become almost  indistinguishable punished the SPD in 2009 with the party's worst  electoral result since World War II.  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: Chancellor Angela Merkel holds the deal as Sigmar Gabriel,  left, of the Social Democrats, and Horst Seehofer, of the Christian  Social Union, shake hands Wednesday in Berlin.

51,1915758863.xml,"It was only on Tuesday that the White House confirmed that the most anticipated meeting of President Donald Trump's tenure -- with Russia's President Vladimir Putin -- will take place on Friday in Germany. But among advisers mindful of the many pitfalls, both domestic and global, preparations have been intense for some time.  The meeting of the two presidents, whose mutual admiration during the 2016 American election campaign stoked allegations of collusion that are now at the center of a criminal investigation in Washington, is certain to be a highlight of a summit of the world's 20 wealthiest countries starting Friday in Hamburg.With issues of North Korea's continued nuclear threats, Syria, Islamic State and global terrorism on the agenda -- and Trump's political future on leaders' minds -- the eyes of the world are trained toward what the White House says will be a ""normal bilateral meeting"" between the two men on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit.""I worry a little about this meeting because Putin is going to walk into the room very well prepared and I'm not certain Trump will come into that room prepared,"" said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and career diplomat who now is a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.Should Trump prove unprepared, that won't be for lack of effort on the Americans' side.Leading up to his first face-to-face meeting with Putin, U.S. intelligence officials have prepared a detailed psychological profile of the long-serving Russian strongman, a former KGB officer who spent decades recruiting spies for the Soviet Union and mastered the art of bending people to his will.The Putin profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn't read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.Yet senior aides have been mute on exactly what the two men will discuss. ""There's no specific agenda,"" Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told reporters.Trump should expect a strong backlash if he doesn't tell Putin to keep out of future U.S. elections, warned the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.""If he doesn't have the courage to raise the issue, Putin will conclude he can walk over our affairs and the president won't object,"" Schiff said. ""That would be a big mistake.""Advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, are trying to carefully script Trump's interaction to head off any attempt by Putin to manipulate the encounter to his advantage, the U.S. officials said.Putin is known to prepare assiduously for such high-stakes encounters with foreign counterparts, developing a command of policy objectives and honing a strategy to extract concessions, one U.S. official said.""Putin was and is a KGB officer and KGB officers are specialists at one thing: seduction -- how to persuade others to do what you want,"" said John Herbst, a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush.""The odds are the atmosphere will be good because our president seems to love Putin, even though it is bad policy,"" Herbst said.Herbst, who as a career foreign service officer helped prepare presidents and secretaries of state before such high-stakes interactions, suggested that Putin will try to establish a personal connection with Trump, who is widely seen among his global counterparts as particularly susceptible to flattery. And Putin will want to convince Trump that Russia is not a danger and NATO is ""not as important"" as Trump's advisers say, Herbst said.The White House said Tuesday that Trump and Putin will have a ""normal bilateral meeting"" Friday afternoon during the G20 summit. That implies a longer, more formal meeting than the conversation he will have with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, as well as other ""pull aside"" meetings with the leaders of several other countries that day.Trump is also scheduled to meet with China's President Xi Jinping at the G20 gathering, and is sure to keep pressing Xi to use China's considerable influence over North Korea to get Pyongyang to cease its nuclear program. Trump could well raise North Korea with Putin, too, amid evidence that Russian firms have been selling arms and oil to the rogue state.The session will be the first formal conversation between Putin and a U.S. president in nearly two years, since the Obama administration moved to isolate Moscow following Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine.Audiences in both the U.S. and Russia will be watching closely to read any signs that one president got the better of the other, said Pifer, the former ambassador to Ukraine.Seemingly small things could make a huge difference.""My fear would be Putin comes out and says something that on the face of it looks like a pretty good deal,"" Pifer said, ""but when you look at the pieces there are some hidden downsides that don't appear until after the president has said yes.""----------brian.bennett@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: President Donald Trump, seen singing the national anthem with first lady Melania Trump on Tuesday, is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.

52,1221035109.xml,"       N. Korea plans launch of long-range rocket BEIJING -- North Korea announced Saturday it would send a  long-range rocket into space this month, trying to make up for a  public relations disaster eight months ago when a much-hyped launch  failed.   In the announcement attributed to a spokesman for the Korean  Committee for Space Technology, North Korea said the rocket would  carry a ""polar-orbiting Earth observation satellite"" for ""peaceful  scientific and technological"" purposes.   The launch is seen as a defiant move for an impoverished country  that is already subject to U.S. sanctions because of its pursuit of  nuclear and missile technology.   The timing of the launch -- between Dec. 10 and Dec. 22, according  to the announcement -- coincides with several sensitive dates for  the Korean peninsula.   On Dec. 19 there is a contested presidential election in South  Korea that could be swayed by the rocket launch.   Perhaps more important on the North Korean calendar, Dec. 17 marks  the one-year anniversary of the death of longtime leader Kim Jong  Il, who is believed to have ordered that a satellite be launched  sometime this year.   A successful launch is also seen as key to establishing the  legitimacy of Kim Jong Un, the late dictator's son and successor,  who is still in his 20s.   In a statement, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that the  North's planned launch is ""a grave provocation and a head-on  challenge to the international community.""   Rebel pullout from Goma renews hopes in Congo   Hundreds of rebel fighters, singing and brandishing weapons, pulled  out of Congo's eastern border city of Goma on Saturday, raising  hopes for negotiations to end the eight-month insurgency.   The withdrawal of the M23 rebel movement from Goma on Lake Kivu, a  strategic hub in Congo's war-scarred east, was agreed to in a deal  brokered by presidents of Africa's Great Lakes states a week ago.

The hearing is to determine whether Manning should face a  court-martial.   Manning's lawyers have sought to have the case dismissed, arguing  his treatment after arriving at the Marine brig in Quantico, Va.,  in 2010 was unduly harsh.   Scores flee wildfire at park in Colorado   DENVER -- A wind-driven wildfire in Rocky Mountain National Park  jumped containment lines overnight, triggering the evacuation of  scores of people Saturday, fire officials said.   Wind gusts of more than 70 mph blew flames from the Fern Lake Fire  close to dwellings and destroyed at least one cabin, said a fire  spokeswoman.   The east side of the park was closed, and 200 people were at an  evacuation center in Estes Park, officials said.   Scouts allowed to keep sex abuse files private   DALLAS -- The Boy Scouts of America has won a temporary reprieve  from turning over decades of confidential files that describe  sexual abuse complaints against adult volunteers.

53,420388062.xml,"         The ultramodern Dresdner Bank building rises from land that used to be part of communist East Berlin, but this winter evening, Americans and Germans are busy putting that and other unpleasant elements of the past behind them. At a crowded reception sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, capitalists are eating, drinking and discussing ways to do something frowned on under the previous regime--make profits.    There is plenty to talk about, since Germany is the world's biggest exporting nation and America the biggest importer. But tonight, it's not business but politics that dominates the atmosphere.    German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Bush met a few days earlier in Washington, and there was big news: They got along. That's not quite as surprising as the report from the Tokyo Zoo of a hamster and a rat snake that happily snuggle together in their shared cage. But in the last few years, harmony hasn't exactly been the norm between the two governments.    U.S. Ambassador William Timken told the gathering, ""What a difference a year makes."" Merkel, he exulted, ""is committed to accelerate a close partnership with the United States,"" even as he suggested that the previous tensions were greatly exaggerated by the news media.    But Bush didn't need the media to tell him he couldn't stand Merkel's predecessor. Gerhard Schroeder loudly opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, siding with the detested French and using Bush as a punching bag during his 2002 campaign.    The president and his subordinates responded by letting it be known that if Schroeder were drowning, they would toss him an anchor.    Forget that Germany has been a big help in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld derided Germany and France as ""old Europe,"" and Bush refused to even take a call from Schroeder after the German leader won re-election.    Merkel is more the president's style--a low-key child of Communism who preaches free markets and supported him on the Iraq war. They met alone in the Oval Office, had lunch together and emerged looking chummier than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The scene brought back fond memories of the days when Germans and Americans joined together to rebuild from World War II, stand firm against the Kremlin and reunite a divided Germany.    But nostalgia only goes so far. However cozy the relationship between Bush and Merkel, things will never return to what they once were.    That's partly because Schroeder is hardly the only German at odds with Bush. A 2002 poll found that 68 percent of Germans preferred a strong U.S. role in the world. Today, 60 percent oppose it.    The case of Khaled al-Masri, a German allegedly abducted by the CIA and imprisoned for five months in Afghanistan before being released, remains an open wound here even after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice privately apologized for the mistake. In her talks with Bush, Merkel didn't hold back from registering disapproval of the U.S. detention camp in Guantanamo.    These issues may be passing irritants, but other changes are here to stay. After World War II, the German-American relationship was defined by NATO, and it worked well for both: The U.S. got a crucial ally in the Cold War, and the Germans found a way to take part in world affairs without sowing panic among the neighbors they had previously conquered.    With the Cold War over, though, Germany has found that its priorities lie mostly with partners in the European Union, not the United States. From this vantage, Europe is drawing closer, while the Atlantic is getting wider.    More important, Germany is no longer shackled by its horrible history. It has redeemed itself sufficiently to behave more or less like other countries--pursuing its own interests without begging everyone's pardon. Merkel has demonstrated that by de-emphasizing relations with France and criticizing Schroeder pal Vladimir Putin.    But she didn't establish her independence from Paris and Moscow only to surrender it to Washington. Eberhard Sandscheider of the German Council on Foreign Relations has said the theme of Merkel's foreign policy is balance--""not just playing with the two or three big partners and forget about the interests of the smaller ones.""    The U.S. and Germany will probably never be as close as they used to be, or as close as the U.S. and Britain remain. But there's no reason they can't work together on their mutual aspirations, while accepting that not all their aspirations are mutual. As Merle Haggard used to sing, it's not love, but it's not bad.    ----------    E-mail: schapman@tribune.com  ",2006-01-29
54,420373917.xml,"         At long last, two months after one of the strangest elections in Germany's modern history, parliament seems certain on Tuesday to elect Angela Merkel, the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, as chancellor, the first woman to hold the position.    Merkel will immediately take power, name a Cabinet and start governing, after weeks of intense negotiations over a program to pursue a ""grand coalition"" with her chief rivals, the departing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats.    It is not only that Merkel is a woman, or even that she will be the first chancellor from the former East Germany, that promises to make Tuesday a moment to remember in this country's history.    In what now seems a swift and unexpected change, Merkel's arrival in power signals a shift to a new political generation, one that did not go through the usual rites of passage to power in Germany.    The Social Democratic Party last week elected a new leader, Matthias Platzeck, who is also an easterner, leading to much comment that after holding them in something close to contempt since unification, the western power brokers have turned to easterners to guide them out of the country's economic crisis.    The emergence of Merkel and Platzeck probably does not constitute a broad trend, but analysts say they both represent some of the qualities of the generation now taking over in German politics.    They are seen as potentially more pragmatic, less ideologically driven than those who have governed for the last half-century or so.    Perhaps most significant, the new leaders are one step further removed from the earlier leadership's preoccupation with German history and the limitations it placed on their freedom of action.

55,1011169638.xml,"      With Francois Hollande's election as France's first Socialist president in 17 years, Europe now must deal with a major leader who has promised to push a different approach to resolving the continent's debt crisis. Hollande's message, that the German insistence on austerity must be tempered with plans to stimulate economic growth, helped propel him to a decisive win Sunday over incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy, with nearly 52 percent of the vote. Hollande, 57, is to take over May 16 from Sarkozy, who became the first sitting French leader to lose a re-election bid in more than 30 years.  ""In the whole of Europe it's time for change,"" Hollande told cheering crowds who gathered to hear his victory speech in Paris early Monday.  Earlier, in an address in his district of Tulle, Hollande vowed to make his election ""a fresh start for Europe"" and declared that ""austerity need not be Europe's fate.""  Sarkozy conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed.  ""I bear the full responsibility for this defeat,"" he said, indicating he would withdraw from front-line politics. ""My place can no longer be the same. My involvement in the life of my country will be different from now on.""  Sunday's results in France, coupled with Greek voters' rejection of political leaders who had supported an international bailout for their country, threatened to rattle financial markets worldwide, with investors worried that the newly elected leaders would steer away from austerity and aggravate Europe's ongoing debt crisis.  Any resulting fallout from Europe could adversely affect the United States' own fitful economic recovery.  One of the first calls the president-elect is expected to make is to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  The message is likely to be conciliatory but firm, a reiteration of his campaign pledge to renegotiate the treaty to limit public spending that Merkel thrashed out with Sarkozy. Having sold himself to the French public as a man of his word, Hollande will not want to start with a broken promise.  But analysts say that Hollande, who favors higher taxation and growth through stimulus spending, actually has little room to maneuver and will need to act fast to placate the financial markets that see him as a threat to Europe's effort to rein in its high levels of public debt.  On Sunday, Standard & Poor's 500 index futures fell 1 percent to 1,348.90 in early trading, indicating there would be a decline in U.S. stocks Monday morning. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average was also heading downward.  France's crippling debt burden saw it lose its coveted triple-A credit rating this year. With the unemployment rate nudging a record 10 percent, coupled with stuttering growth and declining industry, Hollande faces major challenges and must hit the ground running.  After his swearing-in next week, Hollande is due to fly to the U.S. the next day to attend the G-8 meeting at Camp David and the NATO summit in Chicago.  In the intervening 24 hours, Hollande is expected to try to fit in a visit to Berlin to see Merkel. Relations between the two leaders, whose countries are the heavyweights of the European Union, could be complicated by the fact that Merkel publicly supported Sarkozy's re-election bid.  But the German leader is also aware that opposition to her insistence on austerity as the answer to Europe's economic and financial ills is building across the region.  In Greece, the epicenter of the debt crisis, voters Sunday abandoned mainstream parties who had agreed to unpopular cuts in return for bailout funds. Spain, Italy and other countries have also seen massive public protests against austerity plans.  Hollande rode to victory on a wave of anger over austerity measures and a growing sense of inequality in France.  He has pledged to increase taxes for the wealthy by introducing a 75 percent tax rate on personal earnings that exceed $1.3 million a year and to limit the salary of heads of state-owned companies to a maximum of 20 times the lowest-paid employee.  He has also promised greater regulation of financial institutions and said he would force banks to split off their speculative operations.  One of Hollande's first measures will be to live up to his reputation as ""Monsieur Normal"" and slash his own salary, and that of his ministers, by 30 percent, a measure that would put him in stark contrast to Sarkozy, who increased his monthly paycheck after being sworn in.  But in spite of his public dislike of austerity and his calls for more emphasis on promoting growth and employment, Hollande is believed to have assured Germany that he will not be an economic loose cannon within the European Union.  Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that it had obtained a confidential note from the German Embassy in Paris to Merkel's office in Berlin that said Hollande had reassured the Germans that he would not return to Keynesian tax-and-spend practices.  ""Hollande is aware that right at the start of his term in office, he will have to spell out hard truths to the French,"" the memo said, according to the Guardian. It added that Hollande expects to find France's public finances in a worse situation than Sarkozy led his compatriots to believe.

She said the country's cyberdefense agency was investigating.Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said an initial analysis suggests that the material was obtained from cloud services, email accounts or social networks. He said there was no indication that federal government or parliament computer systems were compromised.The German news agency dpa reported that the information included a fax number and email address belonging to Merkel and several letters to and from the chancellor.Although the data reportedly include information such as internal party communications and in some cases personal financial records and credit card details -- some of the data years old -- RBB said there appeared to be no politically sensitive documents.The Twitter account listed as located in Hamburg was taken offline at midday Friday after gaining about 17,000 followers. Appeals court backs president in transgender military caseWASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court in Washington sided with the Trump administration Friday, saying restrictions on transgender men and women serving in the military can stand.The decision lifted an injunction that had barred the government from limiting their service.The unsigned order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has no immediate impact on transgender troops because federal judges in three other cases have temporarily prevented the administration from implementing its policy.The Defense Department said it is continuing to abide by the other court orders that allow transgender men and women to enlist and serve.Even so, the five-page ruling was a blow to the civil rights and gay rights organizations challenging the policy nationwide. China begins first surface exploration of moon's far sideBEIJING -- A Chinese space rover explored the lunar terrain on Friday in the world's first mission on the surface of the far side of the moon.Jade Rabbit 2 drove off a ramp the previous night and onto the soft, powdery surface after a Chinese spacecraft made the first-ever soft landing on the moon's far side. A photo by China's space agency showed tracks left by the rover as it headed away from the spacecraft.The Chinese rover has six powered wheels, allowing it to continue to operate even if one wheel fails. It has a maximum speed of about 200 meters per hour and can climb a 20-degree hill or an obstacle up to 8 inches tall.Previous moon landings have been on the near side of the moon, which faces Earth. The far side has never been explored on the surface. U.S.: Airstrike targeted militant tied to USS Cole bombingWASHINGTON -- An American airstrike earlier this week targeted an al-Qaida operative accused of involvement in the attack nearly two decades ago on the USS Cole that killed 17 sailors, a U.S. military spokesman said Friday.The man targeted, Jamal al-Badawi, is wanted in the United States for his role in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack on the guided-missile destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden. He was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in 2003 and charged with 50 counts of various terrorism offenses, including murder of U.S. nationals and murder of U.S. military personnel.The spokesman said the airstrike was conducted Tuesday in the governate of Marib, which is east of Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, and that U.S. forces are assessing results to confirm al-Badawi's death. Dozens of tourists robbed on trail to Rio landmarkSAO PAULO -- Dozens of tourists hiking toward the famous Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro were held at gunpoint for up to two hours in a mass robbery that could mark an early test for anti-crime crackdowns promised by Brazil's new president.Police said Friday that at least three assailants carrying knives and a gun set up the ambush on the trail, which cuts through a dense forest that borders a slum on the outskirts of the city and has been the site of numerous muggings.More than 30 people were robbed -- about half foreigners from Asia, Europe and elsewhere in South America -- as the thieves took hostages and waited for more tourists to arrive.They took cellphones, cameras, wedding rings and credit cards, police said, adding that nobody was hurt. Weather Channel app sold users' data, suit saysLOS ANGELES -- People relied on the most popular mobile weather app to make plans and figure out how to dress for the elements, but its owners used it to track their every step and profit off that information, Los Angeles prosecutors said Friday.The operator of The Weather Channel mobile app misled users who agreed to share their location information, selling their data to third parties, City Attorney Michael Feuer said.Feuer sued the app's operator in Los Angeles County Superior Court to stop the practice.A spokesman for IBM Corp., which owns the app, said it has always been clear about the use of location data collected from users.The Weather Channel app claims it has approximately 45 million users a month, the lawsuit said.  Announced departure: Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who has served in Congress for nearly four decades and recently shepherded a sweeping farm bill to passage, announced Friday that he will not seek re-election in 2020 at the end of his fourth term, opening up a seat the GOP has held for nearly a century.

57,1968026448.xml,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her European Union partners it's business as usual again as she returned to the international stage and the Social Democratic Party opposition leader opened the door to a governing coalition for the bloc's biggest economy.  Pressure has been mounting on SPD head Martin Schulz to drop his opposition to an alliance with Merkel, after her efforts to form a government with three other parties collapsed Sunday, raising the prospect of an unprecedented repeat election and months of political drift in Europe's biggest economy.Schulz backed off his flat refusal to consider a renewed ""grand coalition"" with Merkel's Christian Democrat-led bloc, saying that the SPD ""won't play an obstructionist role"" in parliament, though he insisted party members will have the final say on any deal.It could be the first step toward rejoining Merkel as junior partner in a government, the combination that's underpinned two of her three terms over the last 12 years.After canceling a planned meeting Monday in Berlin with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and skipping an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, last week, Merkel traveled to Brussels on Friday for a summit of EU leaders and partners from Eastern Europe.Next week, she heads to Ivory Coast for an EU summit with African countries.Governing in a caretaker capacity, the chancellor said she had been asked by EU colleagues about the political situation in Berlin and had sought to reassure them.""I was able to tell them that we, as the acting German government, will fully fulfill our European obligations and that we will actively engage,"" Merkel said in a statement to reporters, adding her comments had been well received.Two months after an inconclusive election that brought a far-right party into parliament, Merkel is still trying to work out how she can govern.While the chancellor is skeptical about ruling without a parliamentary majority, and Schulz wants to avoid a formal coalition, the two sides are inching toward each other.German companies are watching developments in Berlin closely but appear to be confident a favorable solution will be found.The Ifo institute's German business confidence index climbed to a record in November.""Most companies think that in the next weeks or months there will be a government, so the economy is strong,"" Ifo president Clemens Fuest said in a Bloomberg Radio interview Friday. ""Demand is strong, and so far, this political uncertainty doesn't affect the economy.""Schulz is facing calls by SPD lawmakers and state leaders to drop his refusal to join a coalition as junior partner to Merkel's Christian Democrat-led bloc.He favors pledging SPD support for a minority government instead, something Merkel wants to avoid.Manuela Schwesig, the SPD prime minister in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, said the party's willingness to talk did not necessarily mean it was ready to join another ""grand coalition"" with Merkel, the alliance of the two biggest parties.CAPTION: Photo: Germany's Angela Merkel says she reassured her EU counterparts Friday in Brussels.

58,2027069361.xml,"U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is used to being surrounded by diplomats representing murderous regimes, has found out the most dangerous place for her to be: between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.
On Sunday, she said the administration would shortly impose additional sanctions on Moscow for its role in Syria’s chemical weapons program. The president was watching and “yelled at the television,” reports The New York Times.
The next day, the White House said it would not add to the sanctions because the president would “like to have a good relationship” with Russia. Economic adviser Larry Kudlow attributed the apparent reversal to Haley’s “momentary confusion.”
She could have done the country a service by resigning to protest the administration’s vacillating on Russia and lying about her. Instead, she tartly rebuked Kudlow: “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.” Kudlow then admitted that the policy had changed overnight.
Trump takes pride in his self-image as a tough guy. When a protester disrupted a rally, he said, “I’d like to punch him in the face.” After the Parkland, Fla., shootings, he said he probably would have run in to confront the killer, even without a gun.
He’s always putting foreign leaders in their place. He’s slapped the Chinese with tariffs and said he would welcome a trade war. He’s threatened North Korea with destruction. He’s denounced the “brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.”
Allies are not exempt from his ire. Trump has yelled at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, slammed British Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter and derided German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s refugee policy as “insane.” Mexico, South Korea and Japan often get treated rudely.
But when it comes to Putin, Trump doesn’t come across as fierce or demanding. He comes across as scared.
Why is not clear. It may or may not come to light that his campaign conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. A video of him consorting with prostitutes may or may not emerge. Corrupt investments might be uncovered. But what we know already is that he practically grovels before Putin.
During the campaign, he said over and over that Putin had been “very nice” to him. He praised Putin as “a strong leader.” Strangest of all, he complained about Hillary Clinton’s stance on Russia: “She shouldn't be talking so tough.”
This approach was at odds with Republican policy for the previous century. The GOP always regarded Russia as a dangerous rival, if not an enemy, that has to be dealt with firmly and skeptically.
Trump doesn’t see it that way. He has resisted doing anything that might offend Putin. This isn’t because Russia has pulled out of Crimea, abandoned Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, cut back its military or tried to ease tensions with our NATO allies. In fact, Putin has done the opposite.
He even showed a video depicting a Russian missile attack on Florida. Not least important, the Russians interfered in the 2016 election — which Dick Cheney said could “be considered an act of war.”
Shortly after taking office, Trump spilled secrets to the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office. In a recent phone call, he congratulated Putin for being re-elected — even though he had been advised not to and even though the election was manifestly unfair.
He also invited Putin to the White House. And this call happened after Britain accused Russia of poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter.
The president has felt compelled to go along with some measures proposed by his advisers in response to Russia’s aggressive behavior. But Trump has been reluctant. Though he was persuaded to provide weapons to Ukraine, he wanted it kept secret.
He agreed to banish 60 Russian diplomats over the poisoning. But when France and Germany each expelled only four, reports The Washington Post, he was “furious that his administration was being portrayed in the media as taking by far the toughest stance on Russia.”
The docility Trump has so often shown suggests that he is desperate to avoid antagonizing the Russian leader. He doesn’t seem to care that appeasement is unpopular. A new ABC News poll found that 74 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans favor stronger sanctions on Russia.
Trump is also acting against the preferences of congressional Republicans — even though it means looking spineless.
He seems to know something that we don’t know — and he doesn’t want us to know. Maybe the Kremlin doesn’t have material that could destroy Trump. But his administration looks like the world’s longest hostage video.

59,2444871701.xml,"Britain’s government is planning to violate international law.
Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is moving forward in the nation’s Parliament with legislation that will arrogantly abandon part of the departure agreement with the European Union (EU). This has generated the latest crisis in Brexit, the now familiar term of reference for the nation’s departure from the union.
Among other components, the proposed law permits the government to send aid to Northern Ireland without EU approval, and goods shipment with the rest of the United Kingdom without required forms and paperwork.
These may seem like the sort of dull details that are the stuff of life for EU Brussels bureaucrats. However, they are the law, integral to Britain’s departure agreement from the economic institutions on the continent. Modern international law is rooted in, and initially motivated by, the need for orderly regulation among nations in trade, insurance protection and other aspects of commerce and investment.
A large number of Conservative lawmakers, along with many others, are publicly opposed to Johnson’s surprise move. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis counters the proposal would breach international law only in a “limited and specific way.”
“How can the government reassure … that the U.K. can be trusted to abide by the … agreements it signs?” asked Theresa May, Johnson’s predecessor. Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and John Major have also denounced the effort publicly.
At the end of January, the United Kingdom formally departed from the EU. However, the practical relationship does not end abruptly.
According to the agreement, this year involves transition, with the new relationship to be negotiated in detail. This is of vital importance to businesses, but also the population as a whole.
Ideally, the departure will occur without abrupt shocks disrupting trade and investment, tourism, legal and other professional licensing. These and many other sectors will be affected when Brexit occurs in total. Those sectors reach far beyond the business world.
The British voted in 2016 to leave the EU, providing important confirmation of the deep ambivalence in the nation regarding Continental Europe. The close but clear vote in the referendum to depart was unexpected. As with the U.S. presidential election in the same year, the majority of opinion polls predicted the opposite outcome.
Significance for Northern Ireland is profound. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which finally brought peace between warring Catholics and Protestants, depends on economic stability.
The European Union was the product of total, global war, World War II. Early in that conflict, insightful leaders among the Allies concluded that new international organizations were essential to avert a third world war.
One result is the United Nations. Another is the European Union, which grew out of a limited European Coal and Steel Community. Those two industries were tangible, essential and successfully tied France and Germany together.
Destructive German militarism has faded. Today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an especially influential leader in international as well as European terms. She personifies a positive as well as powerful Germany.
Britain’s history reflects pragmatism and realism, successfully brokering Atlantic area and European institutions that keep the peace, through both military and economic means. That history also includes leadership in the law.
Roger Gale, another Conservative member of Parliament, said on Twitter that Britain’s actions are now “regarded worldwide as an act of bad faith,” and that “honor is not for sale or barter.”

61,1941344774.xml,"Germany’s national election Sunday has all the makings of a fait accompli. Chancellor Angela Merkel is on track to gain her fourth term, which would give her 16 years as Germany’s leader. Martin Schulz, her closest rival and leader of the center-left Social Democrats, is behind in the latest polls by double digits. Merkel’s camp can start chilling the Riesling.
In the meantime, Merkel can start thinking about the road ahead - and it’s fair to say it’ll get bumpy.
More than any other leader, the woman Germans affectionately call “Mutti,” or mother, runs the show in Europe. Germany is the European Union’s heftiest, most vibrant economy, and with Britain Brexiting out of the EU, Merkel’s pragmatic leadership has become the dominant voice on the European stage.
But the rules of the game have changed in the eight months that Donald Trump has been president. Europe can no longer count on the White House the way it did in the pre-Trump era. Merkel publicly acknowledged as much last spring when she told Europeans to “take our fate into our own hands. … The times in which we could rely fully on others - they are somewhat over.”
Merkel said “others,” but she meant the U.S. Trump has upended trans-Atlantic relations, pushing positions that are antithetical to the EU agenda. He has said the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change, lauded Brexit, promoted protectionist policies and at times showed a vexing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin leader who digs deep into his toolbox for ways to create fissures in European unity.
It doesn’t help that Europe is more fractured and tenuous than it has been in decades. Great Britain’s departure from the EU takes away the bloc’s second largest economy and leaves it with just one nuclear power, France. To the east, nationalist-minded populist leaders in Poland and Hungary hold power. And the continent is still balancing the accommodation of Middle Eastern and North African refugees with the need to winnow out potential terrorists.
Merkel’s decision to allow as many as a million refugees, primarily from the Middle East, into the country in 2015 made her politically vulnerable, and her popularity dipped. But German officials have since sealed up a major conduit for refugees through the Balkans, and have reimposed border controls. “People are not infused by that feeling any more that this is out of control, that we don’t know what’s going on and who’s coming in,” Germany’s ambassador to the U.S., Peter Wittig, told the Tribune Editorial Board on Thursday. “People now have the feeling that there is an orderly process. And Germans love order.”
Another challenge for Merkel: Turkey has emerged as a major dilemma for Europe as a whole, and Germany in particular. The West recoiled at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s response to last year’s failed coup. After the attempt, Erdogan oversaw a crackdown that jailed 50,000 people and suspended 150,000 from their jobs.
Relations between Germany and Turkey became even more strained last spring, when Erdogan accused German officials of behaving like Nazis after Berlin kept him from campaigning in Germany’s Turkish enclaves ahead of a referendum effectively broadening his presidential powers. Erdogan has since dubbed Merkel’s team “enemies of Turkey.” A NATO member, Turkey also has been edging closer to the Kremlin; it recently bought a surface-to-air missile system from Russia, rankling NATO leaders who see Russia as an aggressive adversary.
Domestically, Merkel likely will have to cope with the emergence of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, which is expected to garner enough votes in Sunday’s elections to gain several seats in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament.
In Germany, voters pick a party, not a leader. It’s a party’s performance in the election that decides how many seats it gets in parliament, and who the country’s leader will be. Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, leads the pack. AfD is fiercely anti-immigration and anti-EU, and at one point during the campaign called for an end to atonement for Germany’s Nazi past. It won’t have enough votes to block Merkel’s agenda, but polls suggest it may get enough support to become the third largest force in parliament.
Americans will be watching keenly how Merkel navigates these shoals, mostly because a strong, united Europe is in America’s best interests. A unified Europe is better fit to tackle terrorism, trade, financial crises, energy policy, immigration and, yes, Russia. We know who wants a weak, fragmented Europe - the shirtless ex-KGB agent to the east.

62,1095447936.xml,"       Israeli prime minister calls for early elections JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced  Tuesday night that he is disbanding his right-wing government and  calling for early elections, blaming a coalition deadlock over how  to slash nearly $4 billion from next year's budget.  Speculation has been rife for months that Netanyahu's inability to  pass a 2013 budget would force him to dismantle what has been one  of Israel's longest-serving coalition governments.  Parliamentary elections, which were expected to take place in  October 2013, will probably occur by February.  Although most polls suggest Netanyahu and his Likud Party will  remain in power, the makeup of his next coalition could change if  the budget becomes the driving issue, analysts say.  Amid a recent jump in government spending and a weakening economy,  Israel's budget deficit doubled during the first half of 2012 to $2  billion, causing concern in financial markets in Israel and abroad.  This summer, Netanyahu pushed through tax hikes and other austerity  measures, but they were enough to provide only a third of the  revenue Israel needs to meet its targets.  After several weeks of negotiations, the prime minister said he was  unable to reach an agreement with his coalition partners over where  to make further cuts. Religious parties objected to reducing  government benefits that many of their ultra-Orthodox supporters  receive. Military hawks scoffed at proposed cuts to the Defense  Ministry.  North Korea says rockets can strike U.S. mainland  North Korea has rockets that can hit the U.S. mainland, it said  Tuesday, two days after South Korea struck a deal with the United  States to extend the range of its ballistic missiles.  Regional powers have for years been trying to rein in North Korea's  nuclear weapons program. North Korea is believed to be developing a  long-range missile with a range of 4,160 miles or more aimed at  hitting the United States, but two recent rocket tests failed.  High court rejects suit against telecom carriers  WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ended a class-action lawsuit  against the nation's telecommunications carriers for secretly  helping the National Security Agency monitor calls and emails  coming in and out of the country.  In 2008, Congress granted immunity to people aiding intelligence  agents.  Without comment, the justices turned down appeals from civil  liberties advocates who contended this mass surveillance was  unconstitutional and illegal.  Terror suspect Mustafa pleads not guilty in N.Y.  NEW YORK -- A radical Muslim cleric whose sermons influenced shoe  bomber Richard Reid in his attempt to blow up a U.S. jetliner  pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges during his first appearance  in a New York courtroom Tuesday after being extradited from  Britain.  Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, also known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, faces  charges that include orchestrating the abduction of 16 hostages in  Yemen in 1998 and conspiring to set up a terrorist training camp in  Oregon in 1999 and 2000.  Air traveler with knives, body bags charged in LA  A man who arrived in Los Angeles on a flight from Japan wearing  a bulletproof vest and flame retardant pants has been charged with  transporting dangerous materials, authorities said Tuesday.  Yongda Huang Harris, who was arrested Friday, was transporting  assorted weapons, biohazard suits and body bags in his carry-on  luggage, authorities say. The search also turned up billy clubs, a  full-face respirator, knives, a hatchet, handcuffs and leg irons,  authorities said.  The Newsmaker  Outspoken teen shot  Gunmen in Pakistan's Swat Valley opened fire Tuesday on Malala  Yousufzai, a 14-year-old girl who won national acclaim for  championing the cause of girls' education in the country's troubled  northwest, seriously injuring her and another girl as they sat in a  school bus.  Iraq buys $4.2 billion in Russian weapons  GORKI, Russia -- Russia announced Tuesday it has signed $4.2  billion in arms deals with Iraq, making it the largest weapons  supplier to the country after the United States.  The deals, disclosed in a Russian government document issued at a  meeting between Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Iraqi Prime  Minister Nouri al-Maliki, give Russia a boost at a time when the  future of its arms sales to Libya and Syria is uncertain.  Fungal meningitis death toll rises to 12 in U.S.  NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- An outbreak of fungal meningitis linked to  steroid injections has claimed four more lives, and New Jersey  became the 10th state to report at least one case of the illness in  a widening health scare, authorities said.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that two  more people died from meningitis in Tennessee, and one more died in  Michigan. The death toll nationwide rose to 12 after officials in  Florida said Tuesday a 70-year-old man died in July.  Americans increasingly report no religious ties  One out of 5 U.S. adults do not identify with a specific religion,  and the number of Protestants has for the first time dipped below  50 percent, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew  Research Center.  Pew researchers said the growing ranks of those with no religious  affiliation suggests Americans may be becoming less religious. The  number of adults who consider themselves atheist, agnostic or  ""nothing in particular"" has increased.

63,1841983438.xml,"       you remember the story from a while back about President Barack Obama using his own money during a government shutdown to open a Muslim museum? It was on Fox News for a while. How about the report that Facebook was going to start charging a monthly user fee? That story was shared more than 1.4 million times. Some legit news agencies also picked up the story about a 15-year-old sentenced to 25 years in prison because he called a SWAT team on a fellow video gamer.   Did you read about the Amish lobby endorsing Donald Trump in the presidential race? About a ban on the national anthem? About gay wedding vans?   All false, but all newsy enough to have been picked up and reported for a while as though they were real. They were created by Paul Horner, a guy who says he has made his living off fake news hoaxes for several years, according to Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post, who has interviewed him.   Fake news is becoming enough of a problem that even Obama mentioned it during his farewell visit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   ""If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,"" the president said in Berlin.   For sure, we have problems. Here is how serious they are.   BuzzFeed's Craig Silverman figured out a way to track real news against fake news on Facebook as the presidential campaign pushed on.   At the outset, most attention was paid to genuine news, but as time passed, more attention was paid to fake news until, just about August, fake news passed real news on the meter. ""Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president"" was one of the high-performing fake stories, along with ""FBI Agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead in apparent murder-suicide."" (Didn't happen.)   The conventional response to fake news is to blame people such as Horner as perpetrators, label them evil and talk about how they must be shut down.   But it's very easy to create fake news.   You just need to make up a convincing ""who, what, when, where, why and how"" narrative and pump it into the river of info coursing through the internet. News desks watch this stuff the way hawks watch bunnies, and they snatch whatever looks juicy.   There are few protections against this. The First Amendment doesn't say anything about truth. It just says, basically, that the government can't prevent us from saying what we want, short of shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater and causing a panic. Essentially, the founders were depending on the educated and well-read public of the future to dispense with meaningless drivel that makes its way into the public arena.   In what now amounts to ""the olden days,"" you could count on an army of highly focused copy editors to scrub the drivel from the daily news diet before it had a chance to soil the public arena.   Now there are not many of those folks left as the media continues to slip and slide down an unpleasant path.   Instead, it is becoming increasingly apparent that meaningless drivel is so very valuable to us that we will grab it with little notice and repost it or publish it or advance its twisted tale just because we can.   You get page views that way!   Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager at the time, and the president-elect's son Eric tweeted links to one of Horner's fake articles.   Post reporter Dewey asked Horner about how this could be happening, and Horner presented a most astute answer.   ""Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore -- I mean, that's how Trump got elected,"" Horner said to The Post.   ""He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they had already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it.""   Folks are always talking about the dumbing down of all kinds of things. I didn't know that could happen to an entire nation, but it has. We are becoming measurably more stupid, if you can wrap your head around that.   We are about to transition from one of the smartest presidents who ever sat in the Oval Office to a remarkably gullible character who was great at selling his name and real estate and spreading rumors.   Compounding that, we are about a decade into the era of mainstream media decline. We are becoming fact-free. Our gullibility is going to get us into vast amounts of trouble, and we are likely to be led there by our most gullible leader, the president-elect.   Remember all that flapdoodle about Obama and his birth certificate? Where do you think Trump got it? He got it from something he heard from someone somewhere. You know, ""People are saying ...""   We have a president-elect who lives in a fantasy zone where narratives emerge that fit his prejudices.   Global warming? Chinese hoax, people are saying. Drug-smuggling immigrants flooding the southern border? I don't know, but people are saying.   We are moving into a troubling world when we can't understand the difference between fiction and fact. And this all would be hilarious were it not so dangerous.   ----------  Former reporter and editor Charles M. Madigan is a communications professor at Roosevelt University.

64,2123436778.xml,"For nearly three weeks, the world has watched President Donald Trump downplay the disappearance and apparent slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and waited for the most powerful man in the world to act. They are waiting still.
Trump's inconsistent and cautious remarks about the case have renewed questions about U.S. credibility and complicated the global response, emboldening adversaries such as Russia and China and discouraging a robust response from traditional allies, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.
""This is a drastic break from American practice,"" said Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ""It signals a very different foreign policy that does not hold governments accountable for things that are outside normal legal or ethical parameters.""
""In effect,"" he added, ""The U.S. is setting a new standing for itself"" - and in so doing, may be setting a new standard for the world.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump this week denied ""giving cover"" to the Saudis.
""I want to find out what happened, where is the fault, and we will probably know that by the end of the week,"" he told the media.
Khashoggi lived in Virginia and wrote articles for The Washington Post that included criticism of Saudi Arabia's government. On Oct. 2, he entered the country's consulate in Istanbul and never emerged. Turkish intelligence believes he was killed and dismembered there by Saudi agents. Saudi Arabia has denied involvement, but has not provided counter-evidence.
The alleged assassination comes just months after the attempted assassination on British soil of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy who acted as a double agent. It comes just weeks after the Chinese head of Interpol temporarily disappeared during a trip home.
""We are at a very critical point where authoritarian powers have great confidence: Russia continues to launch attacks on foreign soil, and now the Saudis have murdered a journalist in the most barbaric way,"" said Nicholas Burns, a professor of the practice of diplomacy and international relations at Harvard, who previously held several senior diplomatic roles.
""In a time like that, the U.S. has to signal that we are not going to tolerate this,"" he added, but ""it's been more than two weeks and there's been no signal.""
Into this void steps Russia, which is using the Khashoggi case to call out alleged hypocrisy by Washington and to seek an advantage in the complex geopolitics of the Middle East.
At a foreign-policy conference in Sochi on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Trump administration's cautious response to Khashoggi's disappearance while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul underlined U.S. double standards.
Putin argued that the West was quick to punish Moscow after the poisoning of Skripal in May, but acted differently with Khashoggi. Russia denies involvement in the poisoning, but Western allies levied sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats. ""There's no proof in regards to Russia, but steps are taken,"" Putin said.
""Here, people say that a murder happened in Istanbul, but no steps are taken. A single approach needs to be figured out to these kinds of problems,"" Putin said.
Putin has invested deeply in ties with Riyadh as part of a broader push to rebuild Russian influence in the Middle East. He hosted King Salman last year for the first-ever visit to Russia by a Saudi monarch, and invited Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to join him at the opening match of the soccer World Cup in June.
On Sunday and Monday, Russian officials, including a deputy foreign minister, met with the crown prince and other top officials in Riyadh for talks on the conflict in Syria, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. A rupture between the United States and Saudi Arabia now could play into the Kremlin's hands.
""We first need to wait for the results of the investigation"" of Khashoggi's disappearance, Putin said. ""How can we, as Russia, start to harm our relationship with Saudi Arabia without knowing what really happened?""
While Western officials and business leaders have been dropping out of a marquee business conference in Saudi Arabia next week, their Russian counterparts have not been following suit. Russia's $10 billion sovereign wealth fund ""plans to actively participate"" in the conference, a spokesman said, and bring along ""top CEOs from Russia, China and other countries.""
When China is pressed on the disappearance of the head of Interpol, the detention of human rights campaigners, or the mass internment of ethnic Uighur Muslims in its far northwest, it tells the international community to respect its sovereignty and butt out.
An editorial in the Global Times, a Communist Party-controlled newspaper known for its strident nationalism, argued this week that the Khashoggi case ""shows that there are double, even multiple standards for the West's human rights diplomacy.""
For China, like Russia, this critique of U.S. actions is not about stopping abuses but shutting down conversation about human rights, analysts say.
""With criticism increasing on Chinese detainment of Uighurs in Xinjiang in concentration camps, Beijing undoubtedly would like to portray the U.S. as insincere in caring about human rights,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Traditional U.S. allies in the Middle East have for the most part fallen in line behind Saudi Arabia, the regional power, saying little about Trump. Europe has also been cautious but is now mustering a piecemeal response, experts said.
""When there is this concern about what the U.S. is going to do, they don't want to be the first to move,"" said Derek Chollet, an executive vice president at the German Marshall Fund, who held senior foreign policy positions in the Obama White House. ""Europeans also have interests in Saudi Arabia, and to a certain extent they are fine with the U.S. playing a heat shield on this issue.""
Germany, Britain and France this week called for Saudi and Turkish authorities to mount a ""credible"" investigation, claiming that they were treating the matter with ""utmost seriousness,"" but not doing much else.
French and German leaders have suggested that they could take a harder line.
""Europe may need to correct its policies toward Saudi Arabia,"" Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, told local media.
He also hinted at the risks of doing so. Europe must ""use our economic leverage so that Saudi Arabia remains on a course of stability in the region,"" he said.
Human rights groups and opposition politicians are pushing for a change in policy.
""Imagine how this government would have reacted if either Russia or Iran had abducted - and in all likelihood murdered - one of their dissident journalists within the sovereign territory of another country,"" wrote Emily Thornberry, Britain's shadow secretary of foreign affairs, in the Guardian.
So far, Trump's calculus seems to be that it's worth protecting the status quo.
Trump has two priorities in the Middle East: an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and containing Iran, said Holly Dagres, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""Trump values Saudi Arabia, not just as an important regional ally that purchases billions of dollars of U.S. weaponry, but as key player on these two major foreign policy issues,"" she said.
Critics wonder whether the Saudi leadership is the best partner for those plans.
""In a stunning and rapid reversal, the Saudi Crown Prince has become a strategic liability abroad and potentially vulnerable at home. The region and the Kingdom itself will be different in important ways as a result,"" wrote Richard Haas, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, on Twitter.
Haas said Trump has taken Putin's word that he didn't interfere in the 2016 election, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's word on denuclearization and now the Saudi leadership's word on Khashoggi's disappearance. There was a time when U.S. policy was ""trust but verify,"" he said. Now it's ""trust but look away.""

65,1811730283.xml,"       Democrats are bracing for another wave of embarrassing disclosures unleashed by what the U.S. intelligence community asserts is a Russian-engineered hacking attack. Guccifer 2.0, the hacker (hackers?) believed to be tied to Russian intelligence, posted on Aug. 12 internal Democratic Party documents with email addresses and cellphone numbers for nearly 200 lawmakers. Guccifer also talked of plans to turn over to WikiLeaks another trove of sensitive material hacked from Democratic Party computers. ""Keep following ..."" the hacker said on Twitter. ""Here I am! They'll have to try much harder to block me!"" If and when new leaks are publicized, that's sure to renew questions about what the Kremlin's motives might be. Is Russian President Vladimir Putin, as many believe, trying to pave the way for a Donald Trump presidency that would look the other way as the Kremlin tramples through Europe? Is he getting back at Hillary Clinton for what he insists was her meddling with Russian politics in 2011 while she was secretary of state? Kremlinology 101 tells us that Moscow's true aims are usually heavily insulated and difficult to fish out. What is clear, however, is Putin's penchant for meddling with the politics of other countries. Case in point: what Germany calls the Lisa Affair. In January, Russian state-owned media put out a story about Lisa, a 13-year-old Russian-German girl in Berlin who claimed she had been gang-raped by Arab migrants. The story whipped up animosity among thousands of ethnic Russians in Germany toward Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who has held fast on her open-door policy toward migrants and asylum seekers. There was just one problem with the story -- German investigators determined it was false. German officials say the Kremlin's propaganda producers worked up the tale. The motive? To weaken Merkel, an EU stalwart and a strong proponent for sanctioning Russian aggression in Ukraine, as she readied her party for regional elections. Across Europe, the Kremlin has been wangling its way into politics to stoke Euroskepticism. In France, a Russian-owned bank lent Marine Le Pen's far-right, anti-EU National Front $11 million ahead of her 2017 presidential campaign. Elsewhere, Russia has nurtured ties with ultra-nationalist organizations such as Hungary's Jobbik Party, regarded in Europe as a neo-Nazi group. Frothing up a Euroskeptic frenzy fits with Putin's overall aim of weakening the European Union and NATO, which he has always seen as an existential threat to Russia. If indeed the Kremlin is behind hacking into the Democratic Party, its motives aren't nearly as clear-cut. Putin openly accused Clinton of fomenting Russian protests against the former KGB leader in the winter of 2011, during Russian parliamentary elections. The hacking of assorted Democratic email accounts or databases could be Putin's way of firing back -- or of flat-out intimidating her: See how easily I can mess with you? Or, he could be harboring visions of a Trump White House that would prove naive and pliable. If it's the latter, Trump should think twice about a Trump-Putin reset in U.S.-Russian relations. Maybe Trump envisions a relationship between two magnates -- a brass tacks, let's-get-down-to-business partnership built on pragmatism rather than ideals. What Trump probably doesn't realize is that Putin's skill set reaches far beyond the corporate boardroom: He's an artful tactician who relies on subterfuge and no-holds-barred aggressiveness to get what he wants. ""If we could get along with Russia, wouldn't that be a good thing, instead of a bad thing?"" Trump told supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month. Somewhere in the recesses of the Kremlin, Putin must have been salivating.  ",2016-08-17
66,420791802.xml,"      Iraq 2 Americans killed in Green Zone Deaths raise concerns about security BAGHDAD -- An American was found dead in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, the U.S. military said Saturday, the apparent victim of an unprecedented slaying that occurred at a time when blast walls are coming down and Iraqi forces are assuming greater control. Another American, believed to be a civilian contractor, was killed Friday night when a rocket struck the Green Zone near the U.S. Embassy, the military said. It was believed to be the first fatal rocket attack there this year. Those deaths have raised concerns about security before the June 30 deadline for all U.S. combat troops to pull out of Baghdad and other cities. At least 66 people were killed nationwide in a two-day string of bombings this week. Afghanistan Military reports major drug seizure KABUL -- International and Afghan forces have killed 60 militants and seized 102 tons of opium poppy seeds, drugs and chemicals during a four-day operation in southern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said Saturday. It was one of the biggest drug seizures by foreign troops since their arrival in 2001, the military said. The attack ""severely disrupted one of the key militant and criminal operations and narcotics hubs in southern Afghanistan,"" the military said in a statement. New York Defense secretary congratulates West Point grads WEST POINT -- Graduating cadets celebrate on Saturday at West Point, where U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates praised them for having the courage and patriotism to join the military in ""a dangerous new century."" Gates noted that the 970 members of the U.S. Military Academy's class of 2009 were preparing their West Point applications in late 2004, even as American forces were battling fiercely in Fallujah in Iraq. Germany President re-elected BERLIN -- German President Horst Koehler won a second 5-year term Saturday, a victory that gave a symbolic boost to Chancellor Angela Merkel's hopes of forming a center-right government after a national election this September. Koehler, a former International Monetary Fund head and a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, secured the required majority by a single vote in the special parliamentary assembly. That was enough to see off a challenge from center-left Social Democrat Gesine Schwan, who was bidding to become Germany's first female president -- a largely ceremonial job. Merkel said she was ""very glad"" about Koehler's swift victory. ""We think he is the president Germany needs in this situation,"" she added. Nevada Plane crash kills family RENO -- A small plane has crashed while approaching an airport in the town of Fallon, killing a naval air station officer and his three daughters, authorities said Saturday. Cmdr. Luther Hook III, 44, died when his twin-engine Cessna 320 crashed and burst into flames Friday night about a mile from the runway after a flight from Fresno, Calif., base spokesman Zip Upham said. Also killed were his three daughters from a previous marriage: Kaitlyn Hook, 15; Rachel Hook, 12; and Mackenzie Hook, 9, all from Clovis, Calif. Hook was the No. 2 officer at Naval Air Station Fallon, which meant he was responsible for ""all the administrative, disciplinary and detail work that makes the base run,"" Upham said. Witnesses told authorities that the plane appeared to be in distress shortly before the crash. Egypt 7 arrested in attack CAIRO --Seven people suspected of ties to an Al Qaeda-linked cell have been arrested in connection with a bombing at a Cairo bazaar that killed a French teen, Egypt said Saturday. The seven were members of a previously unknown group calling itself the Palestinian Islamic Army and had received training across the Egyptian border in Gaza, an unidentified security official said in a statement issued by the Interior Ministry. The group, led by two wanted Egyptians, plotted attacks at other tourist sites and oil installations in Egypt and in France, the statement said. One of the seven arrested confessed that the cell was behind the bombing in February at Cairo's Khan el-Khalili bazaar, said the statement. Wisconsin Woman climbs 7 peaks BAYFIELD -- A retired teacher with multiple sclerosis has now climbed the tallest mountains on each of the seven continents.

67,2021929310.xml,"Puerto Rico set to close 283 schools as families leave islandSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico's Department of Education announced Thursday that it will close 283 schools this summer following a sharp drop in enrollment amid the island's long economic slump and the continued departure of families after Hurricane Maria.Education Secretary Julia Keleher said there would be no layoffs, with teachers and other employees being reassigned to other schools as part of a fiscal plan that aims to save the department some $150 million.The U.S. territory currently has more than 1,100 public schools that serve 319,000 students.""We know it's a difficult and painful process,"" Keleher said. ""Our children deserve the best education that we are capable of giving them taking into account Puerto Rico's fiscal reality.""Keleher said enrollment has dropped by more than 38,700 students since last May and that nearly half of the schools are using only 60 percent of their capacity.After the closures, 828 public schools will remain operational.Keleher said she has invited mayors in the island's 78 municipalities to propose new uses for the shuttered schools.The announcement of closures came two weeks after Gov. Ricardo Rossello signed a bill for implementing a charter schools pilot program in 10 percent of public schools and offering private school vouchers to 3 percent of students starting in 2019-2020 as part of an education overhaul.Aida Diaz, president of a union that represents some 30,000 teachers, said she and others would fight the closures.

Israeli strike on Gaza border kills PalestinianJERUSALEM -- An Israeli airstrike killed a Gaza man Thursday, while a second Palestinian died of wounds sustained in last week's mass protest along the Gaza-Israel border, officials said.The deaths brought to 21 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire over the past week, including 15 who had been involved in the protests.The man killed in the airstrike before dawn Thursday had approached the border fence with an assault rifle, the Israeli military said. It released a grainy video showing the armed man walking in the dark. A new round of protests along the border is expected on Friday.The protest march last week, largely organized by Gaza's Hamas rulers, had been billed as the first of several weeks of intermittent protests against a stifling decade-old Israeli blockade.

68,1650097540.xml,"       Nigeria troops drive back Islamic militants MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Nigerian troops Sunday repelled Islamic extremists who attacked Maiduguri, the biggest city in northeast Nigeria, with several civilians killed by aerial bombs and grenades and mortar shells on the ground.    Soldiers said hundreds of insurgents died.    Terrified residents fled homes shaking from five hours of heavy artillery fire and streamed in from the outskirts of the besieged city of 2 million, already crowded with another 200,000 refugees from the fighting.    In a separate attack, a suspected Boko Haram suicide bomber killed himself and eight others Sunday at the home of politician Sabo Garbu in Potiskum, in neighboring Yobe state, according to witness Abdullahi Mohammed.    Garbu is contesting a legislative seat in Feb. 14 balloting that includes a presidential election too close to call. Boko Haram denounces democracy.    For weeks Boko Haram has been closing in on Maiduguri, the group's spiritual birthplace, and if it were able to plant its Islamic State-style flag there, even briefly, it would give the group a major boost as it loses ground in remoter areas, said Jacob Zenn, author of a book about the insurgents.    Its third attack in a week on Maiduguri came as Chadian forces launched a winning offensive, acting on an African Union directive for Nigeria's neighbors to help fight the spreading Islamic uprising by Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram extremists.  Thousands in Hungary call for new government    Thousands of protesters demanded the ouster of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government Sunday, a day before a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.    About 3,000 people attended the ""Spring Comes, Orban Goes"" rally outside parliament. The Fidesz party's popularity has nosedived since an aborted attempt in October to introduce a tax on Internet use. Some in the crowd appealed to Merkel ahead of her meeting with Orban, holding up signs with slogans in German such as ""Angela, don't negotiate with the mafia.""

Obama urges parents to get kids vaccinated    WASHINGTON -- In the midst of a measles outbreak, President Barack Obama is telling parents to get their kids vaccinated.    Obama says those who don't get their shots can pose a risk to infants and other people who can't get vaccinated.    The president spoke Sunday in an interview scheduled to air Monday on NBC's ""Today"" show.    More than 100 cases of the measles have been reported in the U.S. since last month.  THE NEWSMAKER    Huckabee discusses gays    Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Sunday said being gay is like drinking or cursing -- choices that aren't appealing to him.

Service at the station was temporarily suspended but resumed after about an hour.  France offers support to Greece debt efforts    PARIS -- France's Socialist government offered support Sunday for Greece's efforts to renegotiate debt for its huge bailout plan, amid renewed fears about Europe's economic stability.    The backing was a victory for Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, striking a more conciliatory tone as he seeks new conditions on debt from creditors who rescued Greece's economy to save the shared euro currency. Worries have mounted that Greece's new far left government might not pay back its debts.

69,1020499230.xml,"      Spain and Italy, under increasing fire in Europe's debt crisis,  promised new measures to repair their public finances as their  soaring borrowing costs raised new alarm ahead of a cliffhanger  election in Greece. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel rebuffed pressure from European  Union partners and the United States for Europe's most powerful  economy to underwrite debt or guarantee bank deposits in the  single-currency area.  Spain's 10-year bond rate hit 7 percent Thursday -- it's a danger  level above which Greece, Ireland and Portugal were driven to seek  international rescues -- despite last weekend's eurozone agreement  to lend Madrid as much as $125 billion to recapitalize ailing  banks. The rate ended lower, at 6.92 percent.  ""It is not a situation that can be maintained over time ... and I  am convinced that we will continue to take more measures in the  coming days and weeks to help bring it down,"" said Spanish Economy  Minister Luis de Guindos.  In Rome, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Piero Giarda, in charge of  a public spending review, said Italy will seek to cut $6.2 billion  in state administration spending this year instead of a previously  announced $5.3 billion.  The money saved would help finance areas hit by two earthquakes  last month.  Late Wednesday, Moody's Investor Service slashed Spain's sovereign  credit rating by three notches, to Baa3 -- that's just one level  above junk -- citing the government's ""very limited"" access to  international debt markets and the weakness of the economy.  The downgrade added to a sense of emergency in financial markets  ahead of an election Sunday in debt-plagued Greece that could  deliver a mandate to an anti-bailout party.  But G-20 officials said central banks from major economies stand  ready to take steps to stabilize financial markets by providing  liquidity and preventing a credit squeeze if the outcome of the  Greek election causes tumultuous trading.  ""The central banks are preparing for coordinated action to provide  liquidity,"" said a senior G-20 aide.  Wall Street stocks jumped on the news, with the S&P 500 and the Dow  industrials both closing up more than 1 percent.  Addressing parliament in Berlin, Merkel rejected ""miracle  solutions"" such as issuing joint euro bonds or creating a  Europe-wide deposit guarantee plan backed by new French President  Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Spanish  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.  Such proposals were ""counterproductive"" and would violate the  German constitution, she said. Instead, she called for gradual  steps toward the ""Herculean task"" of building a European political  union.  ""It is our task today to make up for what was not done (when the  euro was created in 1999) and to end the vicious circle of ever new  debt, of not sticking to the rules,"" Merkel said.  She warned against overstraining the resources of Europe's biggest  economy, saying: ""Germany is putting this strength and this power  to use for the well-being of people, not just in Germany but also  to help European unity and the global economy. But we also know  Germany's strength is not infinite.""  Italy, rapidly coming into the firing line, saw its three-year  borrowing costs shoot to 5.3 percent at auction Thursday, the  highest since December, despite Germany's strong expression of  support for Monti's reforms when he visited Berlin Wednesday.  Italy's 10-year bond hit 6.13 percent.  Surging Spanish and Italian bond yields reflect investors' concern  that the 17-nation currency bloc has failed to arrest its debt  crisis and faces turmoil after a general election that could put  Greece on an exit route from the euro area.

70,1446241043.xml,"       Charles de Gaulle, the French Resistance leader and later president of France, was once warned that he should not hate his friends more than his enemies. ""France,"" he replied, ""has no friends, only interests."" It would be interesting to know how he would have responded had he learned, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently did, that his phone communications had been secretly monitored by an American spy agency. But it's a pretty safe bet that he wouldn't have been surprised. Merkel herself probably isn't either, though she made a public display of objecting to the revelation that for years, the National Security Agency had spied on her, along with more than 30 other foreign leaders. A spokesman said the chancellor told President Barack Obama that such spying ""would be a grave breach of trust. Such practices must cease immediately."" French President Francois Hollande likewise expressed shock and outrage at the allegations. But the protests should be taken with a grain of salt. Madeleine Albright said the French, of all people, listened in on her phone conversations while she was ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton. ""This is not a surprise to people,"" she said of the latest disclosures. Bernard Squarcini, who ran the French domestic intelligence service, was equally dismissive: ""The agencies know perfectly well that every country, even when they cooperate on anti-terrorism, spies on its allies,"" he wrote. ""No one is a dupe."" There may be more genuine anger among those leaders not deemed important enough to warrant surveillance. It's not hard to grasp why countries would want to spy on their friends as well as their enemies. If the Obama administration wants to cultivate German or French cooperation on Iran or Syria, it needs all the information it can get about how best to advance that goal. European governments doubtless prefer to get warnings about possible U.S. action at their convenience, not Washington's. Nor can these partners forget that they sometimes differ sharply on matters of great moment. In 2002, Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, won re-election while vigorously denouncing the proposed U.S. invasion of Iraq, and one of his ministers compared George W. Bush to Hitler. Bush wrote in his memoirs that Schroeder had misled him by promising to support the war -- a claim that prompted Schroeder to accuse Bush of lying. The line between ally and adversary is sometimes thin and sometimes movable. The White House was coy about the charge of eavesdropping on Merkel in the past, stating, ""The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor."" But the NSA did deny a report that the president knew about the practice and let it continue. It would hardly be surprising if the agency had done the surveillance on its own -- not because it feared Obama would disapprove but because it wanted to shield him from blame if it became public. ""Plausible deniability"" is often a good thing for a president to have. The public exchanges were part of a ritual exercise that seemed to be done mostly for show. Merkel was careful not to get carried away, saying, ""I think the most important thing is to find a basis for co-operation in the future."" None of the complaining leaders is likely to refuse the information they routinely get from American intelligence. Though the various spy agencies may have to back off a bit at least temporarily, they are not likely to decide that friends don't snoop on friends. This sort of surveillance, at one level or another, will go on. Governments that want to keep secrets -- including our own -- will have to find ways to make their communications more secure. In a dangerous, unpredictable world, no one is going to do it for them.

71,1871924628.xml,"Malaysia: Airport free of toxin where N. Korea head's kin slainKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian Health Minister Subramaniam  Sathasivam said Sunday that autopsy results suggested a nerve agent  caused ""very serious paralysis"" that killed the exiled half brother  of North Korea's leader. On the same day, police completed a sweep  of the budget terminal where he was poisoned and declared it safe  of any toxin.The investigation has unleashed a diplomatic fight between Malaysia  and North Korea, a prime suspect in the Feb. 13 killing of Kim Jong  Nam at Kuala Lumpur's airport. Friday's revelation by Malaysian  police that the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to  kill Kim raised the stakes in a case that has broad geopolitical  implications.The killing of Kim took place amid crowds of travelers at Kuala  Lumpur's airport and appeared to be a well-planned hit. Kim died on  the way to a hospital, within hours of the attack.Tens of thousands of passengers have passed through the airport  since the apparent assassination was carried out. No areas were  cordoned off, and protective measures were not taken. Subramaniam  said there have been no reports so far of anyone else being  sickened by the toxin.The sweep started around 2 a.m. Sunday involving officers from the  police's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear teams, as  well as the fire department's hazardous materials unit and the  government's atomic energy board. Although VX is not radioactive,  police said the radiological team and the atomic energy board were  involved as a precaution.Sewage spill in Mexico flows north into Calif., officials sayLOS ANGELES -- Officials in Southern California are crying foul  after more than 140 million gallons of raw sewage spilled into the  Tijuana River in Mexico and flowed north of the border for more  than two weeks, according to a report.The spill was caused Feb. 2 during rehabilitation of a sewage  collector pipe and wasn't contained until Thursday, the  International Boundary and Water Commission said in its report  Friday. The river drains into the Pacific Ocean on the U.S. side.Serge Dedina, mayor of Imperial Beach, Calif., said city residents  have complained about a growing stench. Dedina criticized federal  officials in the U.S. and Mexico for not alerting people to the  spill.Officials with the commission didn't return calls from The  Associated Press seeking comment Saturday.Merkel: Work must continueon 2-state solution in MideastBERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel is stressing the need to  work for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  after President Donald Trump signaled that he could accept a  different outcome.Merkel's comments in her weekly video message Saturday came ahead  of a March 2 visit to regional power Egypt, where she said she will  discuss the matter with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.Trump said this month that he could accept a one- or two-state  solution if it is agreed upon by all sides.

The injured workers also were sent to  Rafah.Egypt has recently resumed cracking down on the few remaining  tunnels from Gaza after an increase in smuggling.Earlier this month, Gaza's militant Hamas rulers said the  resumption of Egyptian tactics along the border, including flooding  the tunnels or blowing them up, were ""unjustified.""Buffett: Immigrants help 'miraculous' story of U.S.OMAHA, Neb. -- Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, wading into the  national debate over immigration, said the ""miraculous""  achievements of the U.S. economy since its founding can be  attributed in part to people who had the courage to leave their  home countries for the United States.""From a standing start 240 years ago -- a span of time less than  triple my days on Earth -- Americans have combined human ingenuity,  a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and  the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our  forefathers,"" Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire  Hathaway Inc., wrote in his annual letter to shareholders posted  online Saturday.Buffett didn't mention President Donald Trump in the letter, which  offered a full-throated defense of the American market system.Ali's son held, questioned at Fla. airport, attorney saysMuhammad Ali's son, who bears the boxing great's name, was detained  by immigration officials at a Florida airport and questioned about  his ancestry and religion, attorney Chris Mancini said Saturday.Returning from a Black History Month event in Jamaica, Muhammad Ali  Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho Ali, were pulled aside and  separated while going through the immigration checkpoint Feb. 7 at  Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Mancini said.Ali Jr., 44, who confirmed his Muslim faith, was detained about two  hours, despite telling officials that he's Ali's son and a  native-born U.S. citizen.The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said all international  travelers are subject to inspection.Ali, the three-time heavyweight champ, died in June at age 74.German crash: A man drove a car into a central square in the city  of Heidelberg on Saturday, killing one person and injuring two  others, then fled and was shot by police.

72,419240283.xml,"         Two German regional elections on Sunday showed that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's popularity remained strong but also suggested that the opposition Christian Democrats had recovered from the slush fund scandal that engulfed the party last year.    Exit polls showed Schroeder's Social Democrats taking 44.3 percent of the vote in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, a comfortable lead over the Christian Democrats, with 36.7 percent.    But in the prosperous southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Christian Democrats reinforced their long domination, taking an estimated 45.6 percent of the vote and rebuffing the vigorous challenge of young Social Democratic lawyer Ute Vogt, who had campaigned with a slogan of ""fresh air.""    The political air long has been unchanged in Baden-Wuerttemberg, with the Christian Democrats controlling the state government in Stuttgart for 49 years. Voters showed little inclination to switch allegiance to the Social Democrats, who won 33.5 percent of the vote, exit polls indicated.    The voting for state legislatures suggested that while Schroeder's hold on power was solid, he would face a fight in national elections next year. At one point last year, with the Christian Democrats in complete disarray, it appeared the chancellor's re-election would be little more than a formality.    But the German economy, Europe's largest, is showing signs of slowing, and sharp falls recently in German stocks have dented the appeal of the market reforms that Schroeder has generally favored. Moreover, the euro is set to replace the German mark early next year, a switch that may prove traumatic for a people viscerally attached to what was long Europe's strongest currency.    Results showing the Christian Democrats to be an enduring force provided encouragement to Angela Merkel, the embattled leader of the party.    With the party disoriented by the discrediting of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose role in the secret channeling of funds to the Christian Democrats was prominent, she has had difficulty establishing her leadership since she took control last year.    ""I am very satisfied, and I believe that our party can now go further,"" Merkel said in a television interview Sunday.    The Christian Democrats will be particularly encouraged by the travails of the Greens, Schroeder's coalition partner in government. The Greens' share of the vote appeared to fall significantly in both states. It appeared that this setback amounted to censure from voters for remarks by the Green environment minister, Juergen Trittin, who compared a prominent Christian Democrat, Laurenz Meyer, to a ""skinhead"" for declaring that he was proud to be a German.    Most Germans appear sharply critical of Trittin. He said extreme- right parties in Germany often use the badge, ""I am proud to be a German.""    ""We were clearly hurt by Mr. Trittin's remarks,"" said Friedel Gruetzmacher, a leading Green in Rhineland-Palatinate.

73,866522330.xml,"      A Manhattan courtroom packed with petty criminals, well-dressed French journalists, tourists and New York tabloid reporters waited all day for one of the world's most influential financial leaders -- only to learn late Sunday that his arraignment on sexual assault charges had been postponed until Monday. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was charged Sunday with attacking a maid in a luxury suite at a Times Square-area hotel.  His attorneys announced late Sunday that his court appearance was postponed until Monday so he can undergo a ""scientific and forensic examination"" at the government's request.  The tests were being conducted Sunday night.  ""He's tired, but he's fine,"" attorney William Taylor said when asked about Strauss-Kahn.  ""He intends to vigorously defend these charges, and he denies any wrongdoing,"" said another defense attorney, Benjamin Brafman.  The assault allegations have caused a disruption in his job, preserving the stability of global monetary policy, and his possible bid for the presidency of France. First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky will lead the organization in Strauss-Kahn's absence.  ""The IMF remains fully functioning and operational,"" the IMF said in a statement.  The incident began Saturday afternoon, police said.  ""A 32-year-old chambermaid at a Sofitel on 44th Street said that at about 1 p.m., she entered Mr. Strauss-Kahn's room to clean when he came out of the bathroom naked, pushed her onto the bed and assaulted her,"" said Paul Browne, deputy New York City police commissioner. The maid told police that before she could escape, Strauss-Kahn forced her to perform a sex act, Browne said.  She immediately told her supervisor, but before investigators could get to Strauss-Kahn's room he had left the hotel, leaving behind his cellphone and other personal items, Browne said.  On Saturday night, Strauss-Kahn was removed from a plane departing New York for Paris and was taken to the Harlem headquarters of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, which investigates rape and other sex crimes.  The maid was treated at a Manhattan hospital. A police source said she had picked Strauss-Kahn out of a lineup.  A former French finance minister, national legislator and economics professor in Paris, Strauss-Kahn, 62, became the IMF's 10th managing director in November 2007. The IMF, a lending institution with more than 180 member countries, helps oversee the global economy.  He has long been a key player in the French Socialist Party and was considered a likely candidate to challenge French President Nicolas Sarkozy in next spring's election. Early opinion polls showed him with a big lead over the conservative incumbent, who is seeking a second term.  France found itself in a state of collective shock.  Not in his Socialist Party's worst nightmares, nor Sarkozy's wildest dreams, was Strauss-Kahn expected to be at the epicenter of what was described as a ""political earthquake.""  Strauss-Kahn is recognized as a brilliant economist. As head of the IMF, he has been instrumental in approving recent loans to stop the Greek economy from imploding and negotiating the bailouts of Ireland and Portugal.  Only three days ago, the IMF warned that the eurozone debt crisis could engulf the entire continent if European countries did not act to put their financial houses in order.  Strauss-Kahn was due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday and European finance ministers Monday to discuss urgent measures, including a rescue package for Portugal.  But he has long been presented as a Jekyll and Hyde character: on one hand, a charismatic Socialist, business lawyer and graduate of France's most prestigious colleges; on the other, a free-spending lover of luxury and a man who has ""a problem with women.""  Within a year of assuming the job, he was investigated by the IMF board about whether he had had an improper relationship with a former female employee.  The board concluded his actions were ""regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment"" but took no action because the relationship was consensual and did not involve any abuse of authority.  Strauss-Kahn has run unsuccessfully to be his party's nominee for president and has served as a Cabinet minister in left-leaning governments.  He is married to Anne Sinclair, his third wife, who is a leading TV journalist. In a statement Sunday, she said she ""did not believe for a single second"" the accusations against her husband.  - - - About the group  The International Monetary Fund and World Bank were created to promote economic stability and assist countries in need in the post-World War II era.

74,419127804.xml,"      Disavowed, mocked and hounded, former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl celebrates his 70th birthday Monday with every last glimmer of festivity extinguished as a result of his admission of financial wrongdoing. Politics can be fickle. But seldom has a fall from grace been as precipitous as Kohl's. He is the man who united Germany in 1990, settled the country's borders, bound his united country to Europe by sacrificing the Deutsche mark in favor of the euro and solved the ""German question"" that had haunted Europe since the modern German state's foundation in 1871. No official celebration will mark Kohl's birthday. A huge party planned in Berlin's Schauspielhaus by Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has been canceled. So, too, has a celebration for more than 1,000 people that was to have been held in Kohl's hometown of Ludwigshafen in the Rhineland. A decade ago, on his 60th birthday, at the height of enthusiasm for Kohl over German unification, more than 3,000 guests thronged the Beethovenhalle in Bonn, which was then the capital, and 800 attended a party in Ludwigshafen. King Kohl seemed untouchable. But that was before the underside of Kohl's 16-year rule emerged late last year in the form of his admission that he had accepted more than $1 million in secret-- and therefore illicit--donations to the party. His avowal led to further disclosures of illegal payments and of party accounts in Switzerland. ""I have been surprised by Mr. Kohl's attitude,"" said Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democratic governor of Saxony and a leading party member. ""To all of us in the party, not just me, his attitude to this donation and black-account affair has been shocking, to say the least. So festivities are not really in order."" Referring to Kohl's refusal to obey the law and reveal the names of donors, Biedenkopf, 70, added: ""To younger people in Germany, his behavior is just unbelievable. They cannot accept that in a democracy this sort of thing is right."" Throughout the past few months, the former chancellor has appeared profoundly out of step with the times. His was an epoch of Cold War struggles, of labor in the national interest, of the ends justifying the means. Today's politics of goodness, of morality rather than might, appear profoundly alien to him. Nonetheless, the apparent alacrity with which the new Germany of the ""Berlin Republic"" has turned on Kohl has been extraordinary and suggestive of a country where memory is shorter and weighs ever less. Kohl, who has declined to comment on the cancellation of birthday festivities, said he would celebrate privately with his family. He has raised about $3 million to try to offset the financial damage suffered by the party as a direct result of his action. But he remains adamant in his insistence that nothing will lead him to break his ""word of honor"" guaranteeing the anonymity of the donors. The latest threat to Kohl's determination to protect the party's secret financial supporters has come from the files of the Stasi, the pervasive intelligence service of the East German state, which was absorbed into a single German nation under the former chancellor. Kohl told a Berlin radio station Sunday that it was ""completely unacceptable"" to make public any Stasi files containing records of telephone conversations in which he is said to have alluded to the secret donations or their source. There is no way to assess the accuracy of such files, he said. The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that Kohl had ordered his lawyers to try to prevent the publication of such files. Kohl said any decision should be made by the Constitutional Court. The existence of Stasi records of tapped phone conversations made by Kohl since the mid-1970s has been confirmed by Joachim Gauch, the director of the official body that now oversees the more than 6 million files accumulated by the East German intelligence service. Police and parliamentary investigations continue into the actions of Kohl and other party members that resulted earlier this year in the imposition of a fine of $21 million on the Christian Democratic Union. The only leading Christian Democrat to say he does plan to honor Kohl is Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor of Berlin, who has promised to hold a birthday dinner for Kohl some time in May. By May, the Christian Democrats will have held an important congress at which the election of Angela Merkel, 45, a physicist from the former East Germany, as the new party leader is to be confirmed. She will succeed Wolfgang Schaeuble, a protege of Kohl who has also admitted accepting secret funds. ""We have had to overcome a total focus on Mr. Kohl and his 25- year leadership of the party in a relatively short time,"" Biedenkopf said. ""Through this bold leap of generations and cultures to Ms. Merkel, I believe we are demonstrating that we are capable of absorbing the shock and overcoming the blow."" Merkel has said she will wish Kohl well on his birthday Monday on behalf of the party. As for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, he plans to send a letter of congratulations.

75,1013912652.xml,"      Europe is coming to Chicago in the next few days and the great temptation is to set up a quarantine room at O'Hare International Airport. Our visitors have a bad case of the financial flu. We can only hope it's not catching. Greece could collapse in a matter of weeks when its banking system runs out of funds. The tiny Aegean nation's economic illness could spread to the sickly and much larger economies of Italy and Spain.   That would be disastrous for Europeans and a serious problem for Americans. U.S. economic growth depends on the success of the 27-nation European Union, which, taken together, is America's biggest trading partner. Eleven of those 27 countries have slipped back into recession.   Many of them would like to stimulate their way out of recession with government spending. But practically every nation in Europe's southern tier has piled up way too much debt and cannot afford to keep borrowing. Germany, the strongest economy, has rightly forced austerity measures on its free-spending neighbors as a condition of bailouts.   Greece agreed to slash public spending, rewrite rigid labor rules that throttle its private sector and pay off part of its debt over time. In exchange, its banks got a cash infusion and its creditors agreed to write off more than half its debt.   In the wake of the deal, though, unemployment has gotten worse and money has become more scarce. The Greek economy has shrunk for five consecutive years, with no end in sight.   Enraged Greeks have rebelled, turning against their two major political parties in favor of the far right and far left. The country will be up for grabs in June 17 elections. If a new government rejects austerity and renounces its debt, Greece probably will be forced out of the eurozone, the common currency union.   Under the most likely scenario, the European Central Bank would stop funding its banks. To keep the doors open, Greece would have to print its own currency, which would be extraordinarily weak because it wouldn't be backed by wealthier European nations.   Europeans already are adjusting to the idea of losing Greece. The slow-moving euro bureaucracy has acted like a circuit breaker, keeping Greece from a sudden collapse. With time to prepare, systemic risk has been reduced. Governments have made contingency plans and banks have limited their exposure. Financial firewalls are in place to keep a Greek collapse from spreading to Italy, Spain and other vulnerable countries like Portugal and Ireland.   Those firewalls, though, remain a work in progress. The economic future of Europe will be a hot topic when G-8 leaders meet this week at Camp David. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will have to stand strong against her counterpart in France, the newly elected President Francois Hollande, who just replaced Nicolas Sarkozy.   Hollande will be under pressure to make good on his campaign pledge to demand a less harsh economic agreement. Germany will be under pressure to ease on the throttle for financial discipline so Italian and Spanish voters won't rebel as did the Greeks.   While the NATO summit in Chicago will focus on the defense alliance, you can bet the arguments over Europe's economic future will be hot and heavy here.   If Merkel acquiesces to a less onerous timetable for government spending cuts in Italy and Spain, she'll be caving to the folks who want to postpone the day of fiscal reckoning. Her support for ramped-up bond purchases and long-term refinancing at the European Central Bank would be less onerous, but would still risk inflation, which Germans, given their history, particularly fear.   Europe really has no choice but to work off its huge debt over time, though that will hamper economic growth. Its monetary union may wind up losing one or more members. It faces years of slow growth or no growth ... or worse.   Europe, welcome to Chicago. Please try not to sneeze. Caption: Graphic: (Illustration by) Scott Stantis  ",2012-05-17
76,420383917.xml,"         Negotiations to form a new German government were thrown into jeopardy Monday when the leader of one of the two main parties said he would step down after losing an internal power struggle.    The chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muentefering, said he would not run for re-election in November after the party's executive committee rejected his candidate for its No. 2 position.    Muentefering, 65, is representing the Social Democrats in delicate negotiations to form a coalition government with the Christian Democratic Union, led by Angela Merkel. The parties had hoped to wrap up talks in time to elect Merkel as the first woman chancellor Nov. 22.    The turmoil in the Social Democratic Party, however, suggests that that date could slip. Some political analysts here said it could unravel the coalition entirely because Muentefering is viewed as one of the only figures in the party who can impose order on its bickering factions.    ""This is a political earthquake, not only for the Social Democrats but for the coalition negotiations, too,"" said Uwe Andersen, a professor of political science at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.    Although Muentefering said he would continue to take part in the talks, analysts said his weakened status would make an agreement more difficult to reach. A shrewd party operative respected by the opposition, Muentefering has played a central role in managing the transition from the center-left government of Gerhard Schroeder to a so-called grand coalition of the two major parties. He helped broker the deal under which Schroeder agreed to relinquish the chancellorship in return for his party's holding several powerful ministries.    Muentefering was expected to be vice chancellor and labor minister in the new government, which would make him Germany's second-most powerful politician, after Merkel.    His announcement, in a terse news conference, was the latest in a series of shocks for the Social Democrats, once one of Germany's most powerful political machines. Since it returned to power in 1998 under the leadership of Schroeder, the party has struggled to reconcile its heritage as a workers' party with the urgent need to streamline Germany's economy.    Muentefering's decision to step down left politicians here baffled; unlike Schroeder, he is not known for gamesmanship.    The jolt reached other parties, too. Edmund Stoiber, a leading conservative politician who has developed a good rapport with Muentefering, said the announcement had given him second thoughts about his own role in a new government.    Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria, is the designated economics minister under Merkel and has been a constant presence at her side in talks with Muentefering and Schroeder. His defection would sting Merkel because he heads the sister party of the Christian Democrats.    ""Angela Merkel's position is not shattered, but it is undermined,"" said Juergen Falter, a professor of political science at Mainz University. ""We are a step closer to new elections.""    There is little appetite for a new election. Another alternative- -cobbling together coalitions with smaller parties--is no more likely to succeed now than it was after the election.  ",2005-11-01
77,1501550326.xml,"       Ukraine's acting government issued an arrest warrant for President Viktor Yanukovych on Monday and warned the international community that the country needs $35 billion in aid to avert default. Yanukovych slipped out of Kiev on Friday after signing a European Union-brokered agreement that ended bloody confrontation between police and opposition demonstrators by calling for an interim, multiparty government and early elections to replace the effectively deposed head of state.    The arrest warrant issued by the Interior Ministry said Yanukovych was sought on charges of mass murder for his role in last week's deadly crackdown that killed at least 82 protesters and police. Analysts predicted it was only a matter of time before Yanukovych was captured, claiming many of those in his power base in the east of the country had tired of the corruption and self-enrichment of his government.    ""A criminal case has been initiated into mass murders of peaceful civilians,"" acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakhov wrote in a post on his Facebook page. ""A warrant has been issued for the apprehension of Yanukovych and a number of other officials.""    Avakhov did not name the other officials.    Yanukovych's arrest wasn't sought sooner than Monday because the opposition-controlled acting government waited 48 hours for the president to sign the constitutional amendments agreed to last week in the presence of international mediators, said political scientist Igor Popov of the Kiev-based Politika Analytical Center.    Popov said a public trial of Yanukovych was necessary to calm the radical faction of protesters who have refused to leave Independence Square and remain armed with shields and clubs, on guard for further confrontation.    After parliament freed Yanukovych rival and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko from prison Saturday, she appeared before more than 30,000 people at the square.    Tymoshenko, who had been serving a seven-year term on a conviction for abuse of power, a charge regarded by many Western governments as political retribution, spoke of ""Yanukovych and his cronies"" and the crowd chanted ""Yulia! Yulia! Yulia.""    The parliament set a presidential election for May 25. Officials said an interim coalition government may be formed by Tuesday.    Russian President Vladimir Putin has been silent on the chaos engulfing Ukraine, a vital trade partner and a key piece of Putin's envisioned Eurasian Union, an aspiring economic bloc to rival the EU.    Putin was busy hosting the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi until Sunday, and the complexity of Ukraine's internal rupture has likely encouraged the Kremlin to proceed cautiously on its neighbor's turmoil.    Too forceful an approach by Putin to securing Russian industrial and military interests in Ukraine and defending the rights of the 7.5 million Russian minority could encourage secessionist sentiments in the eastern regions, in particular the Crimean Peninsula where Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based.    But watching from the sidelines while anti-Russian feelings fester among the victorious opposition in Western-leaning Kiev could damage Putin's image as defender of Russian assets and populations in the now-independent states of the former Soviet empire.    President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called Putin during the past two days and cautioned him against any moves that could lead to Ukraine's breakup.    The uprising against Yanukovych began in November after the president's decision to scrap an association deal with the European Union that would have boosted Ukraine's trade with the West and eventually set a path for potential membership in the Western bloc.    On Monday, EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn said the association deal was still on offer.    ""We are ready to provide substantial financial assistance to Ukraine once a political solution, based on democratic principles, is finalized, and once there is a new government that is genuinely and seriously engaged in institutional and economic reform,"" Rehn said.    ----------   sloiko@tribune.com Credit: By Sergei L.

78,419560062.xml,"         Germany's conservative opposition Friday settled on Edmund Stoiber, premier of the country's most prosperous state, Bavaria, to lead it in national elections in September. The move came after the first woman to lead a major political party bowed out.    Angela Merkel, who assumed leadership of the Christian Democratic Union two years ago, said she would not seek to unseat Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. She acknowledged that public opinion polls gave Stoiber a better chance.    The conservatives were voted out of office in 1998 and until recently, Schroeder seemed to hold an unassailable lead. But with his popularity eroding quickly as the German economy fizzles, the race is likely to be much closer and harder fought.    An aggressive, articulate conservative who has led Bavaria since 1993, the 60-year-old Stoiber promises a much more ideologically heated race than the one planned by Merkel, who hoped to broaden her party's appeal to women and to people in the former East Germany.

79,2569545205.xml,"WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Monday that it will not tolerate violence against anyone who is trying to obtain an abortion in Texas as federal officials explore options to challenge a new state law that bans most abortions.  Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would ""protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services"" under a federal law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.Garland said federal prosecutors are still exploring options to challenge the Texas law. He said the Justice Department would enforce the federal law ""in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons, including access to an abortion.""The federal law, commonly known as the FACE Act, prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services. The law also prohibits damaging property at abortion clinics and other reproductive health centers.The new Texas law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks -- before some women know they're pregnant. Courts have blocked other states from imposing similar restrictions, but Texas' law differs significantly because it leaves enforcement up to private citizens through lawsuits instead of criminal prosecutors.Justice Department officials have also been in contact with U.S. attorneys in Texas and the FBI field offices in the state to discuss enforcing the federal provisions.""The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack,"" Garland said. ""We will not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services, physical obstruction or property damage in violation of the FACE Act.""Hurricane Larry: The storm churned across the central Atlantic on Monday and was expected to cause life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents along the East Coast of the United States later this week, according to the National Hurricane Center.Larry was about 1,000 miles southeast of Bermuda and moving northwest at 12 mph, the Hurricane Center said.The Category 3 storm had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph.Although there were no coastal watches or warnings in effect Monday, swells generated by Larry were already affecting the Lesser Antilles, the crescent of islands in the eastern Caribbean that curves from the Virgin Islands to Grenada.The swells were expected to spread west by Tuesday and could reach the United States and Canada by the middle of the week, the Hurricane Center said.Larry, which became the 12th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season Wednesday, intensified to a Category 3 hurricane Friday, when Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the Hurricane Center in Miami, said it was ""not forecast to strike the United States.""Prison escape: Israel launched a massive manhunt in the country's north and the occupied West Bank early Monday after six Palestinian prisoners tunneled out of their cell and escaped from a high-?security facility in the biggest prison break of its kind in decades.Israel's Army Radio said 400 prisoners are being moved as a protective measure against any additional escape attempts.The radio said the prisoners escaped through a tunnel from the Gilboa prison, just north of the West Bank, which is supposed to be one of Israel's most secure facilities.The escape marks an embarrassing security breach.Palestinians consider prisoners held by Israel to be heroes of their national cause, and many celebrated the escape on social media.Israeli officials said they have erected roadblocks and are conducting patrols in the area.It appeared to be the biggest Palestinian escape from an Israeli prison since 1987.German data: Germany has protested to Russia over attempts to steal data from lawmakers in what it suspects may have been preparation to spread disinformation before the upcoming German election, the Foreign Ministry in Berlin said Monday.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse said that a hacker outfit called Ghostwriter has been ""combining conventional cyberattacks with disinformation and influence operations,"" and that activities targeting Germany have been observed ""for some time.""She said that, ahead of Germany's parliamentary election on Sept. 26, there have been attempts -- using phishing emails, among other things -- to get hold of personal login details of federal and state lawmakers, with the aim of identity theft.In the Sept. 26 vote, Germany will elect a new parliament that will determine who succeeds Chancellor Angela Merkel. She is not seeking another term after nearly 16 years in charge.The outcome is wide open, with polls showing the main parties fairly close together.Greek composer: Hundreds of people, some carrying flowers, gathered Monday at Athens Cathedral to pay their final respects to Greek composer and politician Mikis Theodorakis, who was an integral part of the Greek political and musical scene for decades.Theodorakis, who died Thursday at 96, is lying in state in a cathedral chapel for three days ahead of his burial on the southern island of Crete. His body arrived Monday after a nearly two-hour delay amid a dispute over burial details.Over the weekend, his family reportedly lifted their objections to him being buried on Crete in accordance with his last wishes. A court had temporarily halted burial plans pending a resolution of the dispute.Theodorakis was also well-known in Greece for his political activism as for his musical career. He penned a wide range of work, from somber symphonies to popular TV and film scores, including for ""Serpico"" and ""Zorba the Greek.""He is also remembered for his opposition to the military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974, a time during which he was persecuted and jailed and his music outlawed.Greece's Communist Party said over the weekend that Theodorakis' body will lie in state beginning Monday, and a ""farewell ceremony"" will be held Wednesday, before the late composer is flown to Crete.The church service and burial will be Thursday.CAPTION: Photo: Jewish new year: Thousands of Jewish pilgrims attend prayers ahead of Rosh Hashana at the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem.

80,1020993415.xml,"      European leaders appealed for patience from the world as the momentary relief from the Greek elections gave way to signs of persistent troubles in Greece, Spain and the eurozone. Greek conservatives scrambled Monday to form a coalition government after winning a national election but fell short of an outright majority needed in parliament. Spain's borrowing costs rose again, renewing worries of a further escalation of the eurozone debt crisis.  The angst in Europe was palpable in Los Cabos, where the Group of 20 nations is meeting for a two-day summit. Even before the meetings formally began, European leaders warned that there were no quick fixes, suggesting a long and bumpy road ahead.  Indeed, even as the presidents of the European Commission and European Council in a joint news conference Monday indicated a willingness to help Athens to hit financial targets to meet its bailout obligations, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that there would be ""no loosening of the reform steps"" for Greece.  The Greek government ""will and must naturally follow through on the commitments that were made,"" she said.  President Barack Obama, as he has repeatedly done with phone calls and personal meetings, has urged Merkel and other European leaders to focus more on growth as opposed to belt-tightening. On Monday, he pressed ahead in a more subtle form that European leaders ease the stringent austerity requirements that have had a punishing effect on the Greek economy and provoked rebellion among many citizens.  ""I think the election in Greece yesterday indicates a positive prospect for not only them forming a government,"" Obama said, ""but also them working constructively with their international partners in order that they can continue on the path of reform, and do so in a way that also offers the prospects for the Greek people to succeed and prosper.""  Obama met separately with Merkel for about 45 minutes in what administration officials described as a ""constructive"" meeting in which they agreed to work together to do what's necessary to support economic growth and stability.  Obama was scheduled to meet separately with his European counterparts after dinner Monday.  European officials hope they can reassure global markets and leaders when they meet June 28 for a summit in which they are expected to lay out plans for a banking union and other steps to strengthen integration and reduce economic imbalances.  European leaders, facing increasing pressure, sought Monday to turn some of the spotlight to other nations, saying Europe wasn't the only party in the G-20 that had financial and debt issues to work out.  ""We are not coming here to receive lessons in terms of democracy or in terms of how to manage our economy,"" said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.  He reminded people that Europe was not the origin of the global financial crisis and that unlike some other countries in the G-20, which he did not name, Europe functioned as a democracy. With 17 nations in the eurozone, he said, ""sometimes it means taking time"" to agree to policy actions.  Moreover, he called on non-European G-20 member nations to fulfill their commitments to a bailout fund for the International Monetary Fund. Europe has pledged to put in more than half of the $430 billion in additional IMF money recently announced. ""Others, unfortunately, aren't on time,"" Barroso said.  Barroso's at-times defensive remarks, echoed with less emotions by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, reflected the heat the European leaders are feeling here from the heads of other major countries whose economies are hurting from persistent financial shocks from Europe. One by one, they are urging their European counterparts, who occupy five of the 20 G-20 seats, to act decisively to resolve the debt crisis, now in its third year.  Still, leaders of the G-20, which represents almost 90 percent of the world economy, have played down expectations that the summit will yield new concrete actions or plans to ease the debt crisis.  Van Rompuy said Monday that people shouldn't expect decisions to be made at the end of the month for any immediate action. And he ruled out any short-term moves on a proposal to share the debt risk with eurobonds, saying that Europe doesn't have the requisite mechanisms and economic balances in place to support such debt-sharing anytime soon.  ""We understand the problems of others,"" he said. ""Please understand ours.""  ---------- dlee@tribune.com  ",2012-06-19
81,420348040.xml,"         Chancellor-designate Angela Merkel faced a deepening political mire after a leading conservative ally tapped to be economy minister announced Tuesday that he was quitting her coalition Cabinet before it even takes office.    Merkel insisted she was ""bound and determined"" to build a stable government, speaking to reporters less than an hour after conservative Edmund Stoiber dropped out of her broad left-right alliance.    The turmoil was sparked Monday when Merkel's intended deputy chancellor, Franz Muentefering, announced he was quitting as leader of the left-leaning Social Democratic Party. He said he didn't know whether he would take his intended job as Merkel's vice chancellor.    His resignation prompted Stoiber to say Tuesday that, given the changed situation, he would remain in his current post of Bavarian governor rather than join the Cabinet.    ""In this altered situation, I have reached the decision that as the head of the party, I can better support the interests of the Christian Social Union in Munich,"" Stoiber said in the Bavarian capital.    Christian Social Union lawmaker Michael Glos was appointed to take Stoiber's place.    Merkel said she and her party respect Stoiber's decision and welcomed Glos as the future economy minister.    She also sought to reassure Germans that both her Christian Democrats and their sister party, Stoiber's Christian Social Union, were committed to working toward building a stable governing alliance with the Social Democrats.    ""This evening I would like to tell the citizens of this country ... I am bound and determined to make the creation of this grand coalition possible,"" she said.    ""It goes without saying that difficult discussions remain ahead of us, but we will conduct them with optimism, determination and a bit of joy that voters have chosen us for this job,"" Merkel said.    Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats tentatively agreed to form an alliance after an inconclusive September election handed neither side a clear majority. The two sides hope to have an agreement in time for parliament to elect Merkel as Germany's first female chancellor Nov. 22.    Social Democratic leaders on Tuesday united behind Matthias Platzeck, governor of Brandenburg state, to succeed Muentefering.    Failure to strike a deal on a coalition Cabinet could lead to a weak minority government being appointed by President Horst Koehler, or even new elections early next year.    Analysts said, however, that given the lack of any convincing alternative alliance, the two sides would have to strive to form a coalition government.    Lothar Probst, a political scientist at the University of Bremen, argued that voters' growing weariness over the maneuvering would increase pressure ""to pull this thing off anyway.""

82,420784420.xml,"      A world impatient for new American leadership greeted President Barack Obama's arrival with exuberance Tuesday but sent telltale warnings of the challenges about to envelop a new chief executive and his partially formed administration. Hopeful for a change from the Bush years, partygoers romped along the Champs-Elysees in Paris, and there were celebrations in the Kenyan village where Obama's father was born and a sleepy Japanese fishing village named ""Obama."" World leaders flooded the White House with their best wishes. Obama, in a nod to the global sentiment and with outgoing President George W. Bush seated nearby, left no doubt in his inaugural address that an important part of his audience was on the far side of the horizon. He promised a new era of American leadership, suggesting that the Bush presidency, with too great a reliance on force, had veered from the American approach that had won World War II and the Cold War. ""Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions,"" he said, in  a remark that seemed to herald a return to earlier periods of U.S. foreign policy. Obama warned violent extremists ""we will defeat you"" but vowed ""mutual interest and mutual respect"" in dealing with the Muslim world. He ruled out the use of harsh detention and interrogation techniques and did not outline a future role for Bush's democracy promotion initiative. Other governments' recent actions may help start this new relationship on the right foot: Israel withdrew tanks and troops from the Gaza Strip, Russia resumed disputed gas exports to Ukraine, and South Korea sent a peace delegation to the North. Allies in Europe hope the arrival of a new president brings them closer to Washington on difficult issues -- such as dealing with international extremism -- and leads to greater reliance on collective action and international institutions. ""All expect this to give a boost to relationships with America, and a boost to our joint efforts on our principal challenges,"" a senior European diplomat said recently. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had good relations with Bush, nevertheless hinted at her differences with the departing Republicans, saying she hoped in the new era there would be agreement that ""no single country can solve the problems of the world."" One of Obama's first challenges will be to improve relations with the Muslim world, a task that has grown much tougher because of accusations that Obama remained silent while some 1,300  Gazans died during Israel's three-week offensive. Obama will demonstrate his intention to get right to work on Arab-Israeli issues by appointing former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to be a high-level envoy to the Middle East, aides said. Mitchell is a onetime judge who served as a Mideast envoy during the Clinton administration and is partly of Lebanese ancestry. Israelis, who rely on U.S. backing, were effusive in their welcome and indicated they could adjust even to a major policy change from the new administration. Israeli President Shimon Peres said Israel wouldn't be alarmed if the Obama administration opened a dialogue with Iran as well as with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. But he predicted that doing so would not be fruitful. ""He wants to build and make peace; they want destruction and war,"" Peres said. A move to engage Hamas would be a sharp departure for the U.S. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, an Abbas spokesman, said Obama called Abbas after the election with two messages: ""He's not going to waste time, and his slogan is 'change.' We're looking for a change in the direction of American policy in the Middle East."" In Tehran, an adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the Iranian president planned to ignore inauguration coverage. ""The tragedy in Gaza made him so upset and he is so preoccupied with Gazans' problems that he does not feel like being glued to the television,"" the adviser told the Los Angeles Times, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Friday, Ahmadinejad said the incoming Obama administration is ""hostile"" toward Gazans. ----------- prichter@tribune.com Credit: By Paul Richter, WASHINGTON BUREAU Staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Jerusalem, Borzou Daragahi in Beirut and Laura King in Kabul contributed to this report.

83,420873406.xml,"      NATO announced Saturday that it will send about 5,000 additional troops and trainers to Afghanistan, a boost that President Barack Obama hailed, but one that failed to include the combat forces his administration had sought. The commitment of extra forces came at the conclusion of Obama's first summit of the most powerful military alliance in the world, an event marked by both pageantry and protest here on the border between France and Germany. The U.S. leader had hoped to parlay his immense popularity in Europe into stronger promises of military support for the war in Afghanistan, which has drawn increasing criticism here. Throughout a visit that started in London, European leaders have jockeyed for position next to Obama, and screaming crowds have gathered for a glimpse of the president and the first lady. But even as European leaders stressed the importance of the Afghan mission, the boost announced Saturday pales in size next to the so-called ""surge"" of 21,000 U.S. troops Obama has pledged to send to help fight the resurgent Taliban. NATO's increased deployment will include 3,000 soldiers on temporary assignment to assist in securing national elections scheduled in August. The remainder will provide training for the Afghan army, to encourage its transformation from a ragtag band into a professional, well-equipped military. Conspicuously absent are the extra combat troops the U.S. had requested, an indication of how deeply divided many NATO countries remain about the war effort and their role in it. Nonetheless, the president portrayed it as a victory in his campaign to refocus efforts on stabilizing and building Afghanistan after the diversion of the Iraq War. ""Keep in mind it was only just a week ago that we announced this new approach. ... We've started to match real resources to achieve our goals,"" Obama said. More resources are still necessary, he said, but, ""these commitments of troops, trainers and civilians represent a strong down payment on the future of our mission in Afghanistan and on the future of NATO."" Obama's comments came as NATO celebrated its 60th anniversary, welcomed two more countries into the fold and named a new secretary general-designate, Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, whose candidacy had generated strong opposition from Turkey, the alliance's only predominantly Muslim member nation. But all eyes were on Obama on his maiden European voyage as president and on the divisive issue of Afghanistan. For months, dating to before Obama's election, the U.S. has been trying to persuade its NATO allies to provide more troops for the battle against Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters believed to be hiding along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. White House and Pentagon officials have acknowledged in recent weeks that their hopes for extra combat forces from NATO had faded. Instead, they have pointed to a wide range of non-military contributions that NATO countries could make, including training Afghan forces and economic development. Such adjustments in expectations reflected not only the unpopularity of the war but also the difficulty the administration faces in repairing the U.S. image abroad enough to win international support. In part, Obama has tried to appeal to ordinary Europeans in the hope of tempering animosity toward the United States. But the war is increasingly unpopular with many Europeans. Yet participants at the NATO meeting agreed that the Afghanistan mission is vital. ""We need to understand Afghanistan is a test case for all of us,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, her co-host of the summit, expressed appreciation for Obama's new strategy. ""We cannot afford to lose, because there [in Afghanistan] some of the freedom of the world is at stake,"" Sarkozy said, adding that Europe was a ""strong pillar"" the U.S. can rely on. There was another minor diplomatic victory for the White House in the unanimous appointment of Rasmussen as the new NATO secretary general, a post that by tradition has gone to a European while the U.S. takes NATO's lead military position. Turkey had objected strongly to Rasmussen's candidacy, citing his defense of the right of a Danish newspaper to publish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The cartoons touched off violent protests in the Muslim world in late 2005 and early 2006. Rasmussen also was seen as hostile to Turkey's hoped-for membership in the European Union. ------------- Kin can visit, but embargo stays With eyes on summit in Caribbean, president to reveal new Cuba policy: chicagotribune.com/obamacuba Credit: By Henry Chu, TRIBUNE NEWSPAPERS Tribune correspondent Christi Parsons contributed from Strasbourg.

84,420447246.xml,"         Caption text only.    Felipe Calderon and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador traded letters last week, each suggesting a way to move past their dispute over who won the July 2 presidential vote and move Mexico forward.    But the letters went nowhere. Instead, the barbs the two camps also traded show scant hope that the candidates will find a way on their own to end the conflict.    As the dispute lingers, concerns grow that Mexico is losing crucial time and that the anxiety and frustration many Mexicans feel could boil over into unrest. A third big rally in support of the apparent losing candidate, Lopez Obrador, was expected to draw a huge crowd Sunday in Mexico City.    ""We feel the climate is becoming more tense and more polarized,"" Gerardo Fernandez Norona, a spokesman for Lopez Obrador's left-of- center Party of the Democratic Revolution, said last week. ""Starting next week, we enter a difficult terrain in which the tension is going to rise and put at risk our democratic institutions, the government transition and the party system.""    Electoral authorities declared Calderon, of the right-of-center National Action Party, the winner by a slim margin several days after the election. But Lopez Obrador complained of fraud and other voting irregularities, which Mexico's electoral tribunal must weigh before confirming Calderon's victory.    Nonetheless, Calderon plans to embark this week on a kind of victory tour that he says is aimed at building a consensus on how to tackle Mexico's many problems.    Lopez Obrador has other plans.    ""I am the president of Mexico,"" Lopez Obrador declared last week in an interview with the U.S. Spanish-language network Univision. ""I am the president of Mexico by the will of the majority.""    On Sunday, Lopez Obrador is to gather his supporters again in the center of Mexico City, where two previous protests drew hundreds of thousands of people.    Lopez Obrador's base steady    Polls indicate that Lopez Obrador's base of support is holding steady.    A survey published Thursday in the Mexico City daily El Universal indicated that 38 percent of Mexicans believe Lopez Obrador won the race--a few percentage points more than his share of the vote. More than 52 percent think Calderon won, the poll said. But 48 percent of respondents supported a recount; 28 percent opposed it.    Almost every day in the capital, supporters stage mini-rallies in favor of Lopez Obrador, who was a popular mayor of Mexico City before running for president.    Their demand is clear: The votes must be recounted, one by one.    In his letter to Calderon, Lopez Obrador said he could never accept that the elections were ""fair, clean and free."" He alleges a host of violations, such as distortions over media access, dirty campaigning, the misuse of federal funds to help Calderon and irregularities at the balloting stations.    But he promised that if Calderon supported a recount and if a recount showed that Calderon had won, Lopez Obrador would accept the result.    For his part, Calderon said that whether the electoral judges decided to count the votes again or not had nothing to do with the wishes of the candidates. It was a question of the law. And he reiterated his invitation to Lopez Obrador to join in a discussion about how best to govern Mexico.    Though he made no specific offer in his letter, Calderon in the past has said he was open to giving Lopez Obrador a seat in his Cabinet.    The most likely result, analysts said, is that the Federal Electoral Tribunal will validate a Calderon victory. It also could call for a limited or full recount.    In the least likely case, the tribunal could order a new election, requiring Mexico to appoint an interim president to take over when President Vicente Fox's term expires in December.    The court must rule on Lopez Obrador's petition by Aug. 31; the winner of the election is to be officially declared by Sept. 6.    ""There is space over the next six weeks for the political actors to reach an agreement,"" said Rossana Fuentes Berain, a Mexico City political analyst. ""Whatever the decision is, they have to find a way so that it will be accepted by all.""    For now, Calderon is lining up support for his claim to office.    Calderon gets German call    Besides accepting and immediately publicizing congratulations from abroad--German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Wednesday-- Calderon is reaching out to Mexicans across the political spectrum.    Though Calderon has faced criticism for declaring himself the winner before results were made official, political analyst Sergio Sarmiento said Calderon has a responsibility to prepare for a potential presidency.    ""I understand very well why Calderon wants to establish contacts and start building an administration,"" Sarmiento said. ""It would be a shock if the result were overturned. Calderon cannot sit and wait for a month without doing anything.""    The party that finished third in the presidential voting, meanwhile, is playing it coy.    The leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in the next Senate, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, warned that reopening the ballot boxes would disrupt future elections by making them vulnerable to calls for recounts.    But in an interview with the Mexico City daily La Jornada, Beltrones added: ""The advantage of opening them up is to wipe clean all the doubt ... which would be extremely beneficial for a president that wants to be installed with all the legality and legitimacy needed.""    ----------    cmcmahon@tribune.com PHOTOS 3; Caption: PHOTO: Candles in Mexico City are arranged to spell ""voto por voto""--""vote by vote""--in support of Lopez Obrador's call for a recount.

Korea a reality, Kim says TOKYO -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Monday the United States should be aware that his country's nuclear forces are now a reality, not a threat. But he also struck a conciliatory tone in his New Year's address, wishing success for the Winter Olympics set to begin in the South in February and suggesting the North may send a delegation to participate.Kim, wearing a Western-style gray suit and tie, said in his customary annual address his country had achieved the historic feat of ""completing"" its nuclear forces and added he has a nuclear button on his desk.""The U.S. should know that the button for nuclear weapons is on my table,"" he said during the speech, as provisionally translated by The AP. The official transcript of his address was expected to be released shortly. ""The entire area of the U.S. mainland is within our nuclear strike range. The United States can never start a war against me and our country.""Kim also called for improved relations with the South. He said the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics would be a good opportunity to showcase the status of the Korean nation.He said the North and South could meet urgently to discuss the North sending a delegation.""The Winter Olympic games that will be held soon in the South will be a good opportunity to display the status of the Korean nation and we sincerely wish that the event will be held with good results,"" he said.The New Year's address is an annual event in the North and is watched closely for indications of the direction Kim may adopt in the year ahead.

Trans people cleared to join military Jan. 1, but future hazyWASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has made clear its proposed ban on transgender military recruits is on hold, meaning their enlistment can start Monday.But the future for transgender people in the armed forces remains murky. The Justice Department isn't dropping its court fight to institute the ban on transgender enlistment but said Friday it would wait for a Pentagon study on the issue in coming weeks before deciding what to do next.President Donald Trump said in July that the government would not allow transgender people to serve in the military, reversing Obama-era policy.

Witnesses: Residents prevented much worse attack in EgyptCAIRO -- Witnesses to an attack outside a Coptic Christian church in Egypt that left nine people dead said Sunday that it was residents and worshippers, not police, who kept the death toll from soaring even higher. One man in particular -- a 53-year-old resident who pounced on the gunman as he was reloading his automatic rifle -- likely saved dozens of lives.Police initially were praised for their quick response to the attack Friday on the church and a nearby Coptic Christian-owned store, but witnesses said the deadly assault lasted 20 minutes and it took an additional 10 minutes before police arrived and shot and wounded the assailant.Worshippers slammed the church's iron gate closed to prevent the assailant from entering, witnesses said. Merkel sees German split over pace of changeBERLIN -- Germans have rarely been so divided about the changes taking place in their society, Angela Merkel, the country's long-time leader, said Sunday, adding in her New Year's address that she is committed to helping tackle the challenges of the future by swiftly forming a new government.Germany has been in political limbo since elections in September, which saw heavy losses for the centrist ""grand coalition"" that has run the country since 2013. Merkel's attempt to forge a new government with two smaller parties failed, forcing her to reach out to her erstwhile partners, the Social Democrats, again.Merkel acknowledged the concerns some in Germany have about the pace of social change, including the influx of asylum-seekers, that saw many conservatives question her leadership. U.N. leader issues 'red alert' for more unity in 2018UNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday issued a ""red alert"" for more unity in 2018 after what he called a year of setbacks.Nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise, inequality is growing, climate change is accelerating and the world is seeing horrific violations of human rights, he said. Global anxieties about nuclear weapons were the highest since the Cold War.The Portuguese diplomat made no mention of specific countries in his brief New Year's message.Guterres said he took office a year ago with an appeal that 2017 would be a year of peace.""Unfortunately -- in fundamental ways, the world has gone in reverse,"" he said. ""On New Year's Day 2018, I am not issuing an appeal. I am issuing an alert -- a red alert for our world.""Spain's maritime rescue service said it saved 66 migrants from two boats in the Mediterranean Sea.The service said that one boat carrying 58 migrants was intercepted by rescue craft in the Strait of Gibraltar before sunrise on Sunday. A further eight migrants were pulled from a second boat.A plane carrying 10 U.S. citizens and two local crewmembers crashed in a wooded area, killing all aboard Sunday, Costa Rica's government said. The Public Safety Ministry posted photographs and video of the crash site showing burning wreckage of the plane in Guanacaste in northwest Costa Rica.CAPTION: Photo: 2018 rolls in: Fireworks explode over the Brandenburg Gate during New Year's festivities in Berlin attended by thousands of revelers.

86,2071102054.xml,"President Donald Trump's claim that immigration is negatively ""changing the culture"" of Europe may be his ugliest racial-ethnic dog whistle yet. But it also points to a disturbing observation, his cozying up not only to Russian President Vladimir Putin but also to rising far-right, populist ethno-nationalism movements spreading across Europe. In a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May before his Monday meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump claimed immigration is negatively ""changing the culture"" of Europe.Although he offered no evidence or examples to back up his remarks, Trump said he believed immigration has been ""very bad for Europe,"" adding that he knew it was not politically correct to talk about but he would ""say it loud.""Like a host whose guest has just dropped something foul into the punch bowl, Prime Minister May bravely defended immigration as a benefit to the United Kingdom, which ""has a proud history of welcoming people."" That's the attitude that has helped the industrialized West to grow strong over the decades.Yet May knew she was not alone among NATO allies who had become a pincushion for Trump's criticisms. For days, he tweeted barbs at German Chancellor Angela Merkel's approach to Europe's migration crisis over which her fragile government wrestles with deep internal divisions.Trump asserted erroneously that crime in Germany is ""way up"" and that immigrants are to blame. ""Big mistake made all over Europe,"" he tweeted, ""in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!""Yet those sentiments contrast sharply with the praise that Trump has heaped on conservative Euro-skeptic leaders like Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Hungary's Viktor Orban.Conte, scheduled to visit the White House at the end of July, was praised as ""a really great guy"" by Trump at the summit of Group of Seven leaders in Quebec in June. The two apparently bonded over the treatment of migrants and the global role to be played by Russia. Conte, leading a coalition of far-right and anti-globalist parties, was the only G-7 leader to voice support for Trump's suggestion that Russia, ejected from the group after its invasion of Crimea in Ukraine, should be readmitted.Orban, after his third landslide election victory since 2010, basks in popularity for his country's economic gains under his party's watch. But he also has guided his government in a troubling authoritarian direction and fanned the public's anger and anxieties over Europe's refugee crisis.Taking the global view, we can see Trump's apparent affection for autocrats and Euro-nationalism goes far beyond Putin. Trump was surprisingly elected to the Oval Office weeks after the U.K. surprisingly voted to leave the European Union; his rise parallels the rise of populist ethno-nationalists and autocrats across Europe and elsewhere on the planet.Europe's far right gained a big boost from anger and anxieties following the the 2008 financial collapse and the flood of refugees from wars in the Middle East and North Africa. In the past, we have seen all sorts of ugly extremism rise to power on populism and nationalism, usually in the wake of big societal changes, none of which seems to have more salience than tribal changes, particularly changes involving race, religion or ethnicity.That's why Trump's alarm over immigrants ""changing the culture"" in Europe brought delight to white nationalists. As Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, observed, It comes ""straight out of the white supremacist, white nationalist playbook.""In the endless battle to keep this new tribalism from ripping our civilization apart, the United States has a distinct advantage: our long-running tradition of welcoming newcomers and encouraging their assimilation into our social mainstream.That's still a new thing for the industrialized nations of Europe, for example, where language and ethnicity are closely tied to national identity. Much of the domestic anxiety over new arrivals in Europe comes from policies that have left immigrants in ghettos, separated from the mainstream culture and economic opportunities.America, by contrast, has been the land of makeovers and reinvention. Immigrants from everywhere are attracted by the opportunities this nation offers to build a better life and a new identity -- as Americans.The more we encourage the virtue of inclusion against the lure of the tribe, the better we can keep our proverbial melting pot simmering, instead of boiling over.----------Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/pagespage.cpage@chicagotribune.comCREDIT: Clarence Page",2018-07-18
87,920076085.xml,"      German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Greece on Monday to make up its mind fast on accepting the painful terms for a new European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout, but the country's political leaders responded by delaying their decision for yet another day. Failure to strike a deal to secure the $170 billion rescue -- much of which Germany will fund -- risks pushing Athens into a chaotic debt default that could threaten its future in the eurozone.    Speaking in Paris, Merkel expressed the exasperation spreading among eurozone leaders at seemingly endless arguing in Athens that hasn't produced a definitive acceptance of the austerity and reform conditions demanded by the lenders.    ""I honestly can't understand how additional days will help. Time is of the essence. A lot is at stake for the entire eurozone,"" she said at a news conference with President Nicolas Sarkozy.    But leaders of the three parties in the coalition government appeared to need at least one additional day.    The office of Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, a former central banker who heads a government of politicians, said that a meeting of leaders from the conservative, socialist and far-right parties due Monday had been postponed to Tuesday.    A statement issued shortly after Merkel spoke gave no reason for the delay but said Papademos would hold further talks with the ""troika"" of lenders -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF -- later Monday.    The party leaders, positioning themselves for a likely general election in April, have balked at accepting another package of deeply unpopular wage and pension reductions, job cuts and tougher tax enforcement measures.    Merkel made clear that her patience was wearing thin on a deal that affects not only Greece but the wider currency bloc, which fears that a default would hit much larger economies such as Spain and Italy.    In a fresh sign of mistrust, the German leader said she and Sarkozy agreed Greece should deposit revenue to meet future interest payments in a special escrow account.  ",2012-02-07
88,420454985.xml,"         The Bush administration Monday persuaded the world's major powers to demand that members of a new Palestinian government reject violence and accept Israel's right to exist, but they fell short of issuing a unified threat to cut off aid if those conditions aren't met.    Still, representatives of the European Union, the United Nations and Russia joined Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in issuing a joint statement Monday that noted ""it was inevitable that future assistance to any new [Palestinian] government would be reviewed"" if and when such commitments are not made.    The four world powers, meeting for the first time since the militant Islamic group Hamas won a landslide victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections last week, make up the so-called diplomatic quartet, which was formed to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.    The Palestinian Authority is almost completely dependent on foreign assistance to fund its annual budget, estimated by U.S. officials at $1.6 billion. The EU is the top donor.    A senior Hamas leader and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Monday for a continuation of that foreign aid to the cash- strapped Palestinian Authority.    Ismail Haniyeh, who led the Hamas slate, made a direct appeal to Western donors at a news conference in Gaza City in the Gaza Strip.    ""We in Hamas are ready to meet and have an open dialogue with the quartet,"" he said. ""We assure you that all the revenues will be spent on salaries, daily life and infrastructure. You can review this.""    After meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Ramallah in the West Bank, Abbas said that ""our talks focused on the need to continue this aid so that our people can stand on their own feet.""    Abbas called the aid vital ""in order that the institutions continue to function and the plan to build our independent Palestinian state is not disrupted or derailed.""    Merkel said Sunday after meeting acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that it is ""unthinkable"" that the EU would support a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority if the group did not renounce violence and recognize Israel.    Standing next to Abbas, Merkel said that she ""made it clear that Germany expects all political forces that carry responsibility to accept the preconditions for political activity. That means for me, firstly, that Israel's existence is recognized, and secondly, there is no use of violence.""    Two senior administration officials traveling with Rice portrayed the jointly issued statement as a victory for American diplomacy, though its wording about financial aid for a Hamas-led government seemed far softer than the rhetoric coming from Washington in the wake of Hamas' victory.    Rice suggested to reporters Sunday that she would press world leaders to cut aid almost entirely, except for urgent humanitarian assistance and funding for the caretaker government currently in power, unless Hamas recognized Israel and renounced violence.    Yet the sentence in Monday's joint statement about the possible review of financial aid ""is going to ring bells"" in the leadership ranks of Hamas, said one of the senior administration officials traveling with Rice who briefed reporters.    The two senior officials spoke on condition of anonymity. They portrayed the statement as an important one primarily because of the diversity of the 25 nations in the EU.    ""We thought that this was actually quite a tough statement because it made it very clear that--absent a significant change in conduct on the part of Hamas--every donor is going to be undertaking that review,"" said the other senior official. He also said, ""many, perhaps all, are going to find it very difficult to continue doing what they've been doing"" financially for the Palestinian Authority.    The Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported that Hamas rejected the demands almost as soon as they were issued.    ----------    csimpson@tribune.com    jogreenberg@tribune.com  Credit: Cam Simpson reported from London and Joel Greenberg reported from Jerusalem  ",2006-01-31
89,420274644.xml,"         In a gamble, a battered Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder persuaded Germany's parliament Friday to set up early elections, almost seven years after he swept to power with promises to revive Europe's biggest economy.    But growth remains dismal and unemployment in double digits as Germans -- like other Europeans -- grapple with how to maintain their comfortable high-wage brand of prosperity.    Those pressures mean Schroeder's risky move could fail. Challenger Angela Merkel proposes a more pro-business approach, and polls suggest it's working. And left-wing challengers opposed to Schroeder's limited welfare cuts are chipping away at his other flank.  ",2005-07-02
90,1520304418.xml,"       Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Thursday that the  Ukrainian government withdraw its troops from the troubled eastern  part of the country, where pro-Russian separatists have been  gaining ground. Putin made the demand in a conversation with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel, who called the Russian leader Thursday about the  deteriorating security situation in eastern Ukraine. She reached  out to Putin a day after Ukraine's acting president said he had  lost control of that portion of his country.   Merkel, who will meet with President Barack Obama on Friday in  Washington, pressed Putin to help secure the release of seven  international observers, four of them German, who have been taken  hostage by separatist forces in the eastern Ukrainian city of  Slovyansk, her spokesman said Thursday.   Putin told her that ""it was imperative today to withdraw all  military units from the southeastern regions"" of Ukraine, and he  called for a ""broad national dialogue"" about reforms to Ukraine's  constitution, the Kremlin said.   Outside the Kremlin, Russia staged a huge May Day parade on  Moscow's Red Square for the first time since the Soviet Union  collapsed in 1991.   Hailed by Putin as a restoration of traditions, workers held  banners -- proclaiming ""I'm proud of my country,"" ""In Putin we  trust"" and ""We're going to vacation in Crimea"" -- and marched in  the center of the city as medals for ""heroes of labor"" were awarded  during an event that drew about 100,000 people, according to  Mikhail Shmakov, head of the Independent Labor Unions Federation.   On the ground in Ukraine, any hope of dialogue appeared to be  slipping further away, as protesters opposed to the Ukrainian  government in Kiev stormed the general prosecutor's office in the  eastern Ukrainian regional capital of Donetsk a day after they had  taken over the city council building there.   Crowds of separatists massed in front of Donetsk's police station  Thursday, demanding that all pro-Russian activists be freed across  eastern Ukraine.   They waved Russian flags and at least one banner depicting World  War II-era Soviet leader Josef Stalin and the Communist hammer and  sickle symbol and played Soviet patriotic songs.   Then they turned their attention to the nearby state prosecutor's  office, where dozens of black-clad riot police with metal shields  stood in front of the entrance.   The mob ripped up stone walls at a nearby park to make rocks to use  as projectiles. Some wearing black balaclavas, they smashed windows  and quickly forced the riot police on the steps of the building to  retreat inside, seizing some of their shields as they did so.   Gunshots and small detonations rang out, and clouds of tear gas  enveloped the building as the struggle continued inside.   At one point, a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier approached the  building in an attempt to relieve the siege but swiftly retreated  when the mob turned in its direction.   Later, a group of policemen cowered outside the building, crouched  on the ground with their shields held over their heads, before  finally surrendering. Stripped of their riot gear, they were led  away through the crowd, their heads bowed as some separatists  struck them.   ""They beat our guys! We should beat them, too. We should put them  on their knees,"" a man and a woman yelled. But a pro-Russian  activist in a riot helmet defended the police. ""They are just  officers on duty, doing their job,"" he shouted back.   Men with close-cropped hair and tattoos stood triumphantly on the  steps of the captured building, banging confiscated batons on riot  shields in unison as the crowd chanted, ""Bravo."" Some carried  pistols. A Ukrainian flag and plastic trident, the national emblem,  burned in a small bonfire close by, along with scraps of wood and a  pair of women's high heels.   The Kiev government, along with its Western allies, accuses Moscow  of orchestrating the uprising. The United States and European Union  have imposed sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea  and involvement in eastern Ukraine.   Russia denies having any part in the rebellion but has warned it  reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians and has  massed tens of thousands of troops on its western frontier with  Ukraine.   Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, said this week  that the police were ""helpless"" to protect citizens and in some  cases were actively colluding with pro-Russian insurgents.   He said the Ukrainian government's goal now is to prevent the  agitation from spreading to other areas, and he called for the  creation of special regional police forces so that a presidential  election could take place May 25 as scheduled.   Citing the situation in the east, Turchynov on Thursday signed a  decree reinstating compulsory military service for men ages 18 to  25.

91,1644608801.xml,"       I wonder how the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo might lampoon President Barack Obama for not attending Sunday's massive march in Paris, an event that drew as many as 1.5 million people and more than 40 heads of state in a show of unity against terrorism. The paper could run a cartoonish sketch of Obama in the White House with a trans-Atlantic selfie stick, snapping a shot of the crowds with himself far off in the background, grinning. Or just print an image of the wall of world leaders who did attend, with a ""photo not available"" spot in the space where a high-ranking American representative should have been.   On Wednesday, when Charlie Hebdo prints its first paper since terrorists stormed the publication's office and killed 12 people, perhaps Obama's absence will just be ignored in lieu of more important tributes and lampoonery connected to a tragedy that shook the world.   That would be an appropriate swipe. The administration's baffling decision to have the U.S. ambassador to France -- Jane Hartley, appointed last year after being a top fundraiser for Obama's 2012 re-election campaign -- be the primary American representative at the Paris march might not be worthy of Charlie Hebdo's attention. But it's certainly worthy of ours.   According to news reports, Obama was at the White House and Vice President Joe Biden was at home in Delaware on Sunday as the Paris march was unfolding. Secretary of State John Kerry was in India and attended previously planned meetings.   Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas were in Paris for meetings related to the newspaper massacre and the additional attacks that led to the death of a policewoman and the killing of four hostages who were held by one of the terrorists in a Jewish grocery store. Holder and Mayorkas were unable to join the city's march -- perhaps they didn't bring comfortable shoes.   A few blocks from the White House, a complementary march was held to show support for France. Obama didn't go to the local march either.   A Washington Post story noted that Obama had phoned French President Francois Hollande and ""said at a speech in Tennessee that the United States stands with France and visited the French Embassy in Washington Thursday, where he signed a book of condolences. American officials have been in touch with and aiding France on a near constant basis, the White House said, and noted that security requirements for Obama and Biden can be distracting.""   Distracting, but certainly not impossible. By Monday afternoon, the White House admitted a mistake had been made.   ""It's fair to say we should have sent someone with a higher profile,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.   Even before that, you could see the administration scrambling.   On Sunday, the White House announced that a previously delayed ""Summit on Countering Violent Extremism"" will be held in February. (Take that, terrorists! We will PowerPoint you into submission.)   Early Monday, The Associated Press put out a story filled with John Kerry quotes in which the secretary of state used more than 200 words (I counted -- it was dreadful) to say: ""Oops!"" and ""I'm heading to France!""   Yes, Kerry is racing to France, and he'll be there right away -- on Thursday, following stops in Bulgaria and Switzerland.   To sum this up, we didn't go to what's being described as the largest rally in French history, a moment in which it seemed the world rose in defiance of any rogues who think an attack on freedom and the press will work. But we are going to hold a conference, and we're sending arguably the most boring American alive for a visit, as soon as he has popped in on a couple of other countries. Oh, and by the way, he speaks fluent French, so they won't miss any of the 256,359 words he utters while attempting to say, ""We're sorry.""   I have no doubt the U.S. government is doing all it can to assist the French and other European countries investigate the attacks and prevent future ones. But that doesn't mean it's OK to just rest on our ""superpower"" laurels and not show up when the world stands united.   You can dismiss it as optics if you want, but optics matter in this age. The terrorists recruit on optics -- photos from Abu Ghraib, images of drone-strike aftermaths. And the same people who see those photos will see the powerful images of world leaders -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, British Prime Minister David Cameron -- joined arm in arm, marching with a sea of people saying terror will not prevail.   There was one notable thing missing in those images: us.   Satire is a powerful way to expose stupidity. But sometimes stupidity stands out just fine on its own.   ----------  rhuppke@tribpub.com  ",2015-01-13
92,418963815.xml,"      Just over six weeks ago, Helmut Kohl was basking in international acclaim, the father of German unification who was no longer in office but once again propelled onto center stage as Germany celebrated the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He shared the spotlight at the celebrations with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and former U.S. President George Bush. No one doubted that he was one of the giants of postwar European politics, a man who had served as German chancellor for a record 16 years and presided over historic change. The Berlin Wall observance was perhaps a final moment of glory for the large man President Clinton once jokingly compared to a sumo wrestler. Now his career is ending in ignominy. He faces demands that he resign his seat in parliament. He could even face a fine for law- breaking, or a jail term. German newspapers have begun comparing a scandal that has erupted around his name with the 1970s Watergate scandal that forced then- President Richard Nixon to resign. ""I was never corrupt,"" Kohl said recently, echoing Nixon's ""I am not a crook."" One German magazine has called him ""Don Kohleone,"" a play on the name of the leading character in Mario Puzo's ""Godfather"" novel, Don Corleone. Kohl, 69, has admitted that he used a variety of illegal bank accounts to accept secret political contributions between 1993 and 1998 and said he funneled the money to local branches of his Christian Democratic Union, the party he headed for 25 years. He has denied enriching himself and denied the contributions ever influenced government decisions. But he has refused to name the people making them. ""The donors had my word that they would remain anonymous,"" he said. ""They are upstanding German citizens who donated the money from their own wealth."" With his refusal to elaborate, Germans have only his word for it that the money did not represent bribes from people seeking favors from the government. That has failed to impress a wide spectrum of public opinion, and even leaders of his party are demanding he come clean. In a dramatic double-barrel attack Wednesday, Kohl's party pressed him to identify the secret campaign donors, and a top party official openly accused him of breaking the law. A Bonn public prosecutor has said he will decide after Christmas whether Kohl should face charges of fraud, misuse of power and money laundering. Under German law, anyone giving more than $10,000 to a political party must be named. Even if the prosecutor doesn't press charges, Kohl's troubles are far from over. A parliamentary investigation into the scandal will begin in January, and he will be called to testify. Volker Neumann, chairman of the investigating committee, has threatened Kohl with a fine or jail if he refuses to identify donors. Long seen as a bumbling figure without much personal charisma, Kohl came into his own after the Berlin Wall fell. He won Gorbachev's approval for the unification of a Germany divided by the Cold War and carried it through in 1990 over the opposition of fellow European leaders Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Francois Mitterrand of France. The popularity he gained from that helped keep him in power until the German economy nose-dived and Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder defeated him in elections in September 1998. The scandal in which he is now enmeshed came to light in late November when Augsburg prosecutors were investigating the affairs of former Christian Democrat treasurer Walter Leisler Kiep. Kiep was suspected of having failed to pay taxes on $555,000 in used bank notes he witnessed being handed to the party's chief accountant, Horst Weyrauch, in a Swiss car park in 1991. Prosecutors suspect the money was given in return for a government decision to allow arms producer Thyssen to export 36 armored personnel carriers to Saudi Arabia in 1991. Karlheinz Schreiber, a Bavarian arms dealer now under arrest in Canada and facing possible extradition to Germany, has admitted he paid the money to Weyrauch but said it was a donation to the Christian Democrats by an unknown third party. Weyrauch told a court he paid the money into a party bank account, but the party's published accounts show no trace of the payment. Weyrauch said he made scores of trips to Zurich on party business, giving rise to speculation that Kohl diverted secret contributions to Swiss bank accounts. Kohl at first denied involvement but later admitted he had received secret contributions averaging $150,000 to $200,000 a year over a five-year period. More recently, German newspapers have reported that Christian Democrat officials in eastern Germany received tens of millions in bribes and ""commissions"" from the French oil company Elf Aquitaine, which took over a huge chemical complex in Leuna in 1992 and the Minol chain of gas stations. Party officials said documents related to the Elf purchase have disappeared. Christian Democrat records show that Hamburg businessman Karl Ehlerding gave $1.8 million to the party before he won a contract to manage the privatization of national rail system properties. His contributions were made public at the time. Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said this week that Kohl ""knowingly broke the law for years while in office."" ""What is worse is that nowhere near everything has come out,"" she said. She called on Kohl to resign from parliament, and her criticism of his silence has since been echoed by Christian Democrat leaders as they have watched their party's support sink in the polls. Party chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, a one-time protege of Kohl, said the former chancellor alone could quash suspicions of corruption by revealing full details of the contributions. ""We have asked him to do this for the sake of the party and for his own sake,"" he said. Christian Democrat General Secretary Angela Merkel, another former Kohl protege, commented: ""Perhaps it is asking too much to demand that Helmut Kohl resign from politics from one day to the next, after such a long life in politics."" But, she added in an open letter published by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ""there is no escaping the fact that we have to take the future into our own hands."" She said the party ""must learn to run on its own . . . without its old warhorse."" Concerning Kohl's promise to give anonymity to donors, she said: ""It may be acceptable to honor your word when a legal activity is involved but not when it involves an illegal matter.""

93,1939428331.xml,"In 2015, suspected Russian hackers broke into the computer networks of the German Parliament and made off with a mother lode of data -- 16 gigabytes, enough to account for a million or more emails. Ever since, German politicians have been watching nervously for the fruits of that hack to be revealed, and for possible embarrassment and scandal to follow. Many warily eyed September 2017 -- the date of the next German election -- as the likely window for Russian meddling to again rattle the foundations of a Western democracy.But with the vote this month -- and with Russian President Vladimir Putin's European nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel, seemingly on track for a comfortable win -- the hacked emails haven't materialized.Nor have Russian-linked propaganda networks churned into overdrive with disinformation campaigns. Even Kremlin-orchestrated bots -- blamed for the spread of fake news in last year's U.S. presidential campaign -- have been conspicuously silent.The apparent absence of a robust Russian campaign to sabotage the German vote has become a mystery among officials and experts who had warned of a likely onslaught. Have Germany's defensive measures -- significantly boosted after the hacks and propaganda campaigns that preceded November's U.S. vote -- succeeded?Or has Russia pulled back, reckoning that the costs of antagonizing Merkel outweigh the benefits?""That's what makes me worried,"" said Maksymilian Czuperski, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. ""Why is it so quiet? It doesn't feel right.""Much is at stake for Russia in the German vote. Merkel, a Russian speaker who has jousted with Putin throughout her 12-year tenure as chancellor, is crucial to the Western alliance's chances of hanging together amid a concerted Russian campaign to pick it apart.To her left and her right are German parties that have advocated a far softer line on Moscow. The far-right Alternative for Germany party has taken stands that would please Putin, including calls to abolish the European Union.Putin has denied that his government is behind efforts to influence elections in the United States and beyond. But if Russia was hoping to undermine Merkel before the Sept. 24 vote, it doesn't appear to be working: Her center-right party has remained well ahead of all competitors in all polls, while the AfD's support seems to have topped out at about 10 percent.Whether Russia makes a concerted push to meddle may not be known until election night -- or beyond. German authorities are certainly not yet declaring victory, and they have urged politicians and the public to remain on alert as the campaign hits the homestretch.In recent days, German cybersecurity officials have warned that Russian-linked networks may try to manipulate the vote count. And the country's top domestic intelligence officer said his staff is conducting hourly checks of sites such as BTleaks to make sure there's no fresh sign of the hacked documents from the Bundestag, the German Parliament.Meanwhile, a leading Merkel ally reported that on the eve of the campaign's only nationally televised debate this month, her website was hit with thousands of cyberattacks -- many of which appeared to emanate from Russian IP addresses.But overall, officials and experts say the scale of apparent Russian interference is far lower than they had expected.Volker Wagner, chairman of the German Association for Security in Industry and Commerce, said his group recently conducted a comprehensive survey of its members on the issue and came up empty. The organization, which works with German intelligence agencies to counteract shared threats, did not find ""any evidence ... that there are more sophisticated attacks coming from Russia in the pre-election period.""Czuperski, meanwhile, said the stream of fake news and bot-spread disinformation had visibly slowed.If evidence of Russian meddling continues to be minimal, experts say, there may be valuable lessons in understanding why Germany has proved unusually resilient. One is that German authorities have been especially aggressive in trying to publicize and combat Russian sabotage efforts as they emerge.German intelligence officials have also named Russian-linked groups as the likely culprit behind the Bundestag hack, and they have been outspoken in their belief that Moscow will try to sway the German electorate against Merkel.In June, German lawmakers passed legislation that imposes multimillion-euro fines on companies that fail to remove fake news and defamatory content from their websites. <CAPTION: Photo: As shown on billboards in Berlin, German voters will choose  Sept. 24 from candidates including Martin Schulz, from left, Angela  Merkel and Katrin Goering-Eckardt.

94,1426218179.xml,"       Britain asked to explain Terrorism Act detention Pressure is building on British authorities to explain the use of anti-terrorism legislation to detain the partner of an American journalist who published information about U.S. surveillance leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.    David Miranda, the partner of reporter Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian, was held for questioning at London's Heathrow Airport for nearly nine hours Sunday, the maximum allowed under Britain's Terrorism Act before a person must be released or arrested.    The Brazilian government issued a statement saying the detention of Miranda, who is a Brazilian national, was ""without justification.""    Senior politicians, human rights activists and an independent reviewer in Britain have also expressed alarm about the incident, according to British news reports.    Widney Brown of the London-based rights group Amnesty International told The Guardian that Miranda's detention was ""unlawful and inexcusable.""    ""There is simply no basis for believing that David Michael Miranda presents any threat whatsoever to the UK government,"" Brown was quoted as saying. ""The only possible intent behind this detention was to harass him ... for his role in analyzing the data released by Edward Snowden.""    Keith Vaz, chairman of the British Home Affairs parliamentary select committee, said he would ask the police to explain why terrorism legislation was used in a case that did not appear to be terrorism-related.  Merkel cancels campaign rallies after hostage-taking    Chancellor Angela Merkel canceled two election rallies in the southern German state of Bavaria on Monday after a 24-year-old man took three people hostage in Ingolstadt, one of the cities where she had been scheduled to speak.    Merkel was due to appear in Ingolstadt and Regensburg as part of a campaign tour.

95,1229939908.xml,"       U.S. hate crimes decline WASHINGTON -- There were 6,222 hate crimes reported to U.S. law  enforcement agencies in 2011 -- a 6 percent decrease from 2010, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation said Monday. But crimes based on  the victim's sexual orientation increased.  Nearly half of hate crimes reported in 2011 were racially  motivated. The majority -- 72 percent -- of racially motivated  crimes were directed at African-Americans, while 16.7 percent were  motivated by anti-white bias, according to the report. Some 59  percent of the known offenders for all reported hate crimes were  white, while 21 percent were black.  The Anti-Defamation League welcomed the overall decrease in hate  crimes, but called the increase in the number of crimes motivated  by the victim's sexual orientation ""disturbing.""  Religious bias accounted for nearly 20 percent of reported hate  crimes. Thirteen percent were anti-Islamic, but the large majority  were anti-Semitic in nature.  Sudan, South Sudan ask AU to aid troop withdrawal  Sudan and South Sudan have asked the African Union to help hammer  out details of a proposed withdrawal of troops from their disputed  border, defense ministers from both countries said Monday, as  stalled talks continued to delay oil exports.  Weeklong negotiations in Khartoum failed to reach an agreement on  how to withdraw their armies.  Meanwhile, Princeton Lyman is stepping down as special envoy for  Sudan and South Sudan, the White House said Monday.  Russia hits back at U.S. over rights legislation  MOSCOW -- Russia's parliament moved Monday to bar entry to the  country for Americans who violate the rights of Russians,  retaliating against U.S. legislation passed last week to punish  Russian human rights abusers.  The bill approved by the U.S. Senate on Thursday would deny entry  to Russians allegedly involved in the 2009 prison death of lawyer  Sergei Magnitsky, who became a symbol of the abuse of Russians who  challenge the state.  Thousands protest China's rule of Tibet  NEW YORK -- Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the United  Nations on Monday calling for an end to Chinese rule in Tibet,  where dozens of Tibetans have set themselves on fire in recent  weeks to protest China's control of their homeland.

Mexico president aims to fix education system  MEXICO CITY -- President Enrique Pena Nieto on Monday announced a  broad reform aimed at improving Mexico's educational system, a plan  that also seems aimed at weakening the powerful teachers union.  Mexico has some of the worst public schools in the hemisphere,  consistently placing low on international surveys. Many blame the  union, which has perpetuated a system that allows teachers to buy  or inherit their jobs.

96,420196935.xml,"         For the United States and Europe, Angela Merkel's triumph over Gerhard Schroeder in the ""Battle of Chancellors"" is expected to produce a subtle but substantive shift in Germany's foreign relations.    The broad outlines of the new German government became clear this week after Merkel, who will become the country's first female chancellor and the first to come from the former East Germany, announced her Cabinet choices. Two key names are Thomas de Maiziere, who will be chief of staff, and Wolfgang Schauble, her interior minister. Both are committed Atlanticists with many friends in Washington.    Schroeder's party shares power    Schroeder last week announced he would not be part of the new government. But after last month's election producing a political stalemate, Merkel will be forced to share power with Schroeder's Social Democrats, who will hold eight Cabinet portfolios to Merkel's six, including the Foreign Ministry.    For that job, the Social Democrats have selected Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a longtime Schroeder confidant who most recently served as his chief of staff. The 49-year-old lawyer has a reputation as a terrific organizer and hard worker, but he has no experience in foreign affairs. He also lacks the considerable charm and charisma of Joschka Fischer, the Green Party leader who held the job in Schroeder's coalition.    ""He's known as a fixer, not a big visionary . . . not a high- profile figure,"" said William Drozdiak, president of the American Council on Germany. ""That will open opportunities for Merkel to play a more assertive role in foreign policy.""    The biggest change will be a more cooperative attitude with Washington. Merkel is expected to pay an early courtesy call on President Bush.    U.S.-German relations fell after Schroeder salvaged his 2002 election bid by opposing U.S. plans to invade Iraq. But he didn't stop there. Schroeder teamed up with French President Jacques Chirac to make sure the U.S. and Britain lost their attempt to obtain UN Security Council backing for the war.    After that, Bush decided he could not trust Schroeder and refused to speak to him for 18 months.    According to foreign policy analysts on both sides of the Atlantic, Merkel is not expected to reverse policy and send troops to Iraq. Bush and the Iraq war remain deeply unpopular in Germany.    ""But the tone will change, and in diplomacy, the tone is often the reality,"" said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London think tank.    Instead of looking to score points against the U.S., a Merkel- led government will look for common ground. An example followed the Christian Democrats' narrow election victory when the Bundestag, the German parliament, quickly reaffirmed the country's commitment to maintain 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, the second-highest number after the U.S.    The tone of Germany's relations with the European Union also is expected to undergo change. The Paris-Berlin axis that has dominated EU affairs for many years is likely to weaken mainly because Merkel, a former physicist, has not been bowled over by Chirac's Gallic charm.    ""She does not have a close rapport with Chirac; she's much closer to Sarkozy,"" said Drozdiak, referring to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French interior minister and leader of Chirac's center-right party who is seen as a likely successor to a politically weakened Chirac.    Merkel and Sarkozy, who met before the election and got on well, are like-minded on the need for major structural reforms for their economies, Drozdiak said.    Britain, Russia to feel change    ""Merkel is also in sync with [British Prime Minister] Tony Blair and agrees with his desire for reforms in the EU,"" he said.    Another likely area of change under a Merkel chancellorship is the deference Germany paid to Russia during Schroeder's tenure.    ""She will not be so sycophantic in her dealing with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and this will help produce smoother relations with the Poles and other eastern Europeans,"" said Grant, the London analyst.    Grant noted that Schroeder's close relationship with Putin often benefited the EU as much as Germany, such as the time Schroeder persuaded the Russian leader to allow a rerun of the flawed presidential elections in Ukraine.    But on other occasions, their coziness has been seen as a snub-- even a threat--to other members of the EU.    Last month, Poland and Lithuania were outraged when Germany skirted normal EU channels and concluded a $5 billion Baltic pipeline deal with the Russians. The Poles, in particular, fear that the Russians might divert energy away from them for political purposes.    Poland and other former Soviet satellites have urged the EU to pursue a collective policy toward Russia, and Merkel has said she agrees.    ""She will repair bridges, and that will restore some German weight to the EU,"" Grant said.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Chancellor-designate Angela Merkel congratulates Norbert Lammert in Berlin after his election Tuesday as speaker of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.

97,420776245.xml,"      They mingled cordially and dined on Scottish salmon, and not a single person stormed out of the dinner of world leaders at the British prime minister's home late Wednesday. In fact, the place cards even seated President Barack Obama next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who just a few hours earlier had  derided the American plan to rescue the global economy. So it was a fitting opening to the Group of 20 economic summit: Courtesy and civility reigned even as disagreement simmered. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to walk out of the summit if his demands for global financial regulation aren't met. And on Wednesday, Sarkozy joined Merkel in a public statement against the idea of more government spending to spur the economy, an important feature of the U.S. plan. The two leaders have increasingly coordinated their message of greater financial regulation as a counterweight to British and American calls for more spending. ""France and Germany will speak with a single voice,"" Sarkozy said. The flip side to the Merkel-Sarkozy show was the other dynamic duo of this week's summit: Obama and his host and ally, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who held a news conference of their own Wednesday. Brown praised the American leadership on regulating the financial system, on recapitalizing banks and restructuring the country's banking system. He said he thought that the leaders were ""within a few hours"" of agreeing on a global plan for economic recovery and reform. ""Never before has the world come together in this way to deal with an economic crisis,"" Brown said.  As for Sarkozy's threat, Brown said he was sure things would work out. ""I'm confident that President Sarkozy will not only be here for the first course of our dinner,"" he said, ""but will still be sitting as we complete our dinner this evening."" Obama also downplayed the differences, calling them ""vastly overstated."" ""The truth of the matter is that I think there has been an extraordinary convergence,""  Obama said. But analysts pointed out that the philosophical differences  are real. ""There have long been differences between Germany, France and Britain about classic roaring Anglo-Saxon capitalism as practiced in New York and London,"" said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics. ""I suspect that the German and French governments see this as a once-and-for-all opportunity perhaps to tame the excesses of Anglo-Saxon market-driven economics."" At their joint appearance, Sarkozy and Merkel dug in further on their view that the summit needs to produce concrete measures for international regulation of the finance sector, not new fiscal stimulus packages. ""This has nothing to do with ego; this has nothing to do with temper tantrums,"" said the French leader, whom critics accuse of indulging in both. ""This has to do with whether we're going to be up to the challenges ahead or not."" Meanwhile, Merkel pointed out that both the U.S. and Europe have put in place major stimulus packages, arguing they ought to be given a chance to work before adding more. Travers said that the  split between Brown and Obama on the one hand and Merkel and Sarkozy on the other is informed by domestic as well as international politics. Sarkozy's popularity has plummeted at home, and Merkel faces elections this fall; both have a need to be seen representing their countries' viewpoints at the summit without  playing the spoiler. ""It would be surprising if there were any grand walkouts or refusal[s] to sign things,"" Travers said. ----------- cparsons@tribune.com henry.chu@latimes.com The G-20, viewed from Chicago Read what Tribune foreign editors are reading on the Web, including analysis of the G-20 summit from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs: chicagotribune.com/globalreads Credit: By Christi Parsons and Henry Chu, Tribune correspondents Caption: Photo (color): World leaders joined Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.

98,1509396206.xml,"       Planned as a springtime tour with a modest itinerary -- affording time to chat with the pope, admire the Rembrandts and take in the Colosseum -- President Barack Obama's weeklong trip to Europe instead has become a high-stakes test of whether he can move the continent's leaders into a tougher response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. Obama will huddle Monday in Amsterdam with other members of the G-7, seeking a strategy against what many see as the most threatening European land grab since World War II. He will have to navigate disagreements among the European nations over how far to go, and the price they are willing to pay, to sanction Russia for seizing the peninsula from Ukraine.   Obama will have to reassure Russia's nervous neighbors that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is prepared to uphold its promises to defend them.   It's a retro role for the president, as well as for Western Europe, which has been snapped back into its pivotal place in global geopolitics. And it's not one that Obama -- who has spent his presidency talking about shifting U.S. policy away from the Old World -- is likely to have anticipated.   ""It's going to require an enormous amount of American leadership in Europe, which we have not seen for the last five years,"" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.   Much of Europe welcomed the election of Obama after the go-it-alone style of President George W. Bush. But many diplomats since have come to view the U.S. administration as dismissive and disengaged. And that was before a top American official was caught on tape several weeks ago, rudely brushing off the European Union's views on unrest in Ukraine.   On Obama's itinerary Wednesday will be his first visit as president to Brussels, the seat of the 28-member European Union. The U.S.-EU summit there, following a meeting on nuclear security at The Hague earlier in the week, will be the first such get-together since 2011.   The president's role in strategizing with his European counterparts also is complicated by revelations last year of U.S. spying on European heads of state and of bulk collection of phone data. The scandal has touched a nerve, particularly in Germany.   What role past diplomatic snubs and current stress will play in whether the U.S. and Europe can keep a united front remains to be seen. Administration officials argue Obama has close relationships with key leaders -- he has spent hours on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in recent weeks -- and has worked in tandem with the EU in crafting the response to Russian President Vladimir Putin.   ""We are already quite closely coordinated with our European partners,"" national security adviser Susan Rice said, and the meetings will provide an ""opportunity to deepen and continue that coordination.""   The response to the Kremlin thus far, an incremental ratcheting up of economic sanctions, has come under fire for being insufficient. Putin scoffed at the first round of sanctions on a small group of Russian officials. A second round hit more officials and some billionaires in Putin's inner circle, as well as a bank favored by elite Russian officials.   Obama and EU officials also have threatened to cut off whole segments of the Russian economy from trade if Moscow escalates the situation.   But Europe, in a better position than the U.S. to put pressure on Russia, will need to be eased into enacting a long-term, potentially costly sanctions regime, experts said.   Its closer trade ties and its reliance on Russian oil and gas mean it would experience far more fiscal blowback from any sweeping sanctions. Disagreements over how to spread the ensuing economic pain will inevitably slow the process.   Obama's challenge is to nudge competitive European nations to act jointly and, as much as possible, mitigate the sacrifices, said Jeremy Shapiro, a former senior adviser on Europe at the State Department and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. Shapiro said Obama may offer to express some support for increasing natural gas exports from the United States, a gesture that could encourage Europeans worried about a lengthy energy embargo.   ----------  khennessey@tribune.com Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: President Barack Obama's European trip has taken a more serious tone since Russia's annexation of Crimea.

99,1889758547.xml,"Turkey's steady march toward dictatorship just went into full gallop.
Voters on Sunday narrowly approved a raft of constitutional changes that shift even more power to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who already maintains an iron grip over his country. Beginning in 2019, the post of prime minister will disappear, and Erdogan can make Cabinet appointments without any parliamentary oversight. His control over the country's judiciary will expand. He can also dissolve parliament at any time, for any reason. And, starting with the 2019 elections, Erdogan, who took power as prime minister in 2003, can run for two more five-year terms.
Erdogan's margin of victory was razor-thin, and there were strong indications that the vote was far from fair. International election observers criticized the decision by Turkish election officials to allow as valid more than a million ballots that had been cast without an official stamp. Without the stamp, authorities can't be sure those ballots aren't fraudulent. During the campaign, authorities arrested a leading opposition politician campaigning against the ""Yes"" movement and cracked down on journalists critical of the referendum.
An undemocratic election shouldn't surprise anyone, given Erdogan's track record for authoritarian governance. After a failed coup attempt, his government arrested more than 40,000 perceived opponents of the regime and purged more than 100,000 from their government jobs. Erdogan blamed the coup attempt on his primary political rival, Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who once was a close Erdogan ally and who now lives in Pennsylvania. Washington has rejected Ankara's requests for Gulen's extradition, saying Turkey must convince U.S. courts that there's enough evidence to charge Gulen with a crime.
So far, the West has reacted to the election with measured criticism. The State Department said irregularities on the day of the election and the run-up to it led to an ""uneven playing field"" in favor of the ""Yes"" movement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the close vote reflected the deep divisions within Turkish society, and she urged Erdogan loyalists and opposition leaders to talk out their differences.
If Western leaders choose their words carefully about Turkey, it's because they have to. Turkey is a NATO member integral to the fight against Islamic State in Syria. It allows the U.S. to use an air base at Incirlik for its airstrikes and drone flights into Syria. It also has provided haven to more than 3 million Syrian refugees and has a deal with European leaders to keep refugees from traveling on to Europe.
But if Turkey is going to fulfill its decadeslong goal to join the European Union, it needs Western backing. Expecting Erdogan to reform isn't realistic, but that doesn't mean Europe should compromise its principles for EU inclusion. Those principles require EU applicant nations to maintain ""stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights …."" Turkey is veering away from - rather than approaching - those principles. Erdogan also has been talking about holding a referendum on the reinstatement of the death penalty, which would nix the country's bid for EU membership.
Erdogan can't have it both ways. He can't run roughshod over democratic principles and then expect the EU to welcome Turkey, no questions asked. Turkey's too valuable in the fight against Islamic State to treat like a pariah. But it's not so valuable that the European community should abandon core ideals it applies to other countries that join.

100,419127583.xml,"      The nation's scandal-scarred conservatives elected a woman from the former East Germany as their new leader Monday, hoping an untainted new head can pull the party out of a crisis set off by illegal donations accepted by former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Angela Merkel, 45, was enthusiastically confirmed by a Christian Democrat Party trying to escape its slush fund scandal. She is the first woman to head a major German party. Delegates responded with cheers and warm applause as Merkel sought to rally her bruised party after months spent fighting the affair and took aim at Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left government. ""We have won enough of a breathing space to refocus the public's interest on the core of the political contest in Germany,"" she told a packed hall of cheering delegates, who elected her unopposed with 96 percent of the vote. ""We are back!"" In an interview later, she said the party would wait until early in 2002 to nominate a challenger to Schroeder, even though voter polls indicate she is far ahead of any internal CDU rivals and could also beat Schroeder. Yet all the convention floor talk of a fresh start failed to mask the party's shortage of compelling themes to challenge Schroeder. Merkel's calls for lower taxes, private enterprise and balancing the winners and losers of the global economy broke little new ground. Schroeder's governing Social Democrats weren't impressed with Merkel's debut speech. ""When it comes to issues of our country's future, she remained vague,"" said Franz Muentefering, the party's secretary general. Senior Christian Democratic leaders insisted that the party can win again only if it reclaims the broad political center. ""Forget about right and left,"" said Lower Saxony Gov. Kurt Biedenkopf, an economics professor. ""What we need is competence and open debate."" It remains unclear whether Merkel can assert authority in a conservative camp where her liberal stands on issues such as immigration and abortion are viewed with great suspicion by some. She immediately courted controversy by suggesting in her speech that Germany needs an immigration policy--a red flag for conservatives who insist that Germany is not a country of immigrants. Foreigners make up about 10 percent of the nation's population. Schroeder has triggered a heated debate on immigration with a recent proposal to invite thousands of foreign computer programmers to meet a shortage in Germany. Merkel stopped short of rejecting the idea outright, even though her party is campaigning against it ahead of elections next month in North Rhine-Westphalia, the nation's most populous state. Merkel served in Kohl's Cabinet after German unification in 1990. But she broke with her former boss early in the scandal and gained stature by keeping the party together during the crisis. Kohl touched off the affair in December with his admission that he accepted some $1 million in secret--and thus illegal--donations while chancellor in the 1990s. The man who united Germany and governed for 16 years was absent Monday, the first party convention he has missed since 1951.

101,1871457230.xml,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's long-held dream of  expanded powers and up to 10 more years in office will soon go  before voters. But the proposed constitutional changes, which would  usher in a presidential system with a weak parliament, no prime  minister and a subservient judiciary, have divided the country and  embittered his critics. Parliament, which Erdogan's Justice and Development Party  dominates, endorsed the package Jan. 19, in effect voting to strip  itself of power, and election authorities set April 16 as the date  for a nationwide referendum.There hasn't been much public discussion, and when it begins,  Erdogan has seen to it that the airwaves are likely to carry the  government case. But that's only one element of the problem for  free discussion.Turks are still recovering from a failed coup in July and are  living under a state of emergency. They are in a state of shock  from terrorist attacks and worried by the continuing Kurdish  insurgency in the southeast.The news media have been subjected to unprecedented intimidation,  with Erdogan ruling by decree and closing down print outlets and  broadcast units as he sees fit. Print and broadcast media are now  almost entirely in the government camp, and 151 journalists and  other news media workers are in jail.Foreign human rights monitors have issued scathing reviews of the  proposals for constitutional change, under which Erdogan, already  in power for 14 years, will be head of his party, government and  state -- and be eligible to run for two more five-year terms. If  passed, the changes would take effect in 2019.The amendments will ""pose a huge threat to human rights, the rule  of law and the country's democratic future,"" for they will  ""concentrate unchecked power in the president's hands,"" New  York-based Human Rights Watch said last month.The current political environment is ""completely inappropriate for  a vote of any kind,"" said Nate Schenkkan, a Turkey expert in the  Washington-based Freedom House, who added that the April 16  decision will shape Turkey for decades to come.The Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights body,  voiced ""deep concerns"" about whether the revised constitution would  guarantee separation of powers, checks and balances, and  independence of the judiciary, ""which are a prerequisite for  democratic societies.""In a report Wednesday, the European commissioner for human rights  expressed ""grave concerns"" that the amendments would reduce the  autonomy of an already weak judiciary and fail to address the  current constitution's ""serious shortcomings"" in human rights and  freedom of expression.And the European Union's most powerful politician, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel, while in Turkey this month, called the  changes a ""profound political transformation"" and urged that  ""everything should be done to ensure that separation of powers and  plurality of opinion are guaranteed.""Pro-government media have predicted an easy victory for Erdogan,  with one daily newspaper, Sabah, calling it a ""shoo-in.""Polls, however, show the public is almost evenly divided. Erdogan  acknowledged as much Sunday as he left on a tour of Persian Gulf  states.""At this moment, I don't think our people have come to the point  where they can understand the presidential system clearly,"" he  said.The uncertain prospects seem to have rattled him and his top aides,  who demonize opponents as following the lead of terrorist  movements.There's little dispute that Turkey needs a new constitution to  replace the 1982 document imposed on the population by a military  government and since ratified 18 times. But unlike the last major  attempt to draft a constitution 10 years ago, which added whole  sections to protect civil and human rights, the latest amendments  focus on Erdogan's desire for a presidential system.Freedom House's Schenkkan expressed surprise that Erdogan was  putting so much effort into the changes when he already has the  power. ""What is the point? He's already undisputedly running the  country,"" Schenkkan said.The 18 amendments to be voted on came about not by holding a  convention or assembling a panel of experts, but in an undisclosed  backroom deal between Erdogan's party, which has 317 deputies in  the 550-seat parliament, and the rival Nationalist Movement Party.Until the failed July coup, the Nationalist Movement Party was a  bitter critic of suspected corruption in Erdogan's party.The second-biggest party, the Republican People's Party, with 133  seats, is dead set against the changes, as is the other major  party, the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party.As many as 12 members of the Kurdish party are in jail on suspicion  of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, which is  at war with the Turkish state.One tactic used by the government's campaign has been to use the  country's crisis to paint potential ""no"" voters as PKK  sympathizers. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim charged last week that  the PKK and followers of self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom  Erdogan blames for the coup attempt, ""are terrorists and of course  we say 'yes' to what they say 'no' to.""Erdogan, far from maintaining neutrality as he is obliged to under  the current constitution, said Sunday that the referendum was a  response to the coup attempt. ""The position of those who will say  'no' in the referendum could mean siding with July 15,"" he said,  referring to the date of the coup attempt.Erdogan was ""just making an observation,"" said Ahmet Berat Conkar,  a member of parliament from Istanbul, representing Erdogan's party.  He said neither Erdogan nor Yildirim think that ""no"" voters are  members of terrorist groups.""What they are saying is that these groups are very strangely  lining up in the same camp,"" he said.Then last week, Erdogan used his emergency powers to suspend  Turkey's equivalent of the ""fairness doctrine,"" so there will be no  penalties if television stations fail to give equal time to  speeches for and against the referendum. With nearly all TV  networks in the pro-government camp, this could stifle public  debate.----------Roy Gutman is a special correspondent.CAPTION: Photo: Members of the Nationalist Movement Party hold signs reading  'no' during a protest against the upcoming referendum.

102,1622547452.xml,"       Ukraine says Russian mercenaries fill east DONETSK, Ukraine -- Kiev accused separatists of preparing for  renewed conflict in east Ukraine on Tuesday by bringing in Russian  mercenaries and rearming as heavy shelling increased strains on a  crumbling cease-fire.  In Berlin, the European Union's foreign affairs chief said the  bloc's foreign ministers would discuss new punitive measures  against Russia next week, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel ruled  out further economic sanctions for now.  Shelling around Donetsk, the main rebel stronghold, and artillery  exchanges elsewhere punctured a truce that has been violated by  what Kiev says are armed Russian incursions, and what the rebels  call a new offensive by government forces.  ""Russian mercenaries are strengthening and reinforcing (rebel)  forces near the front line,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy  Lysenko said in Kiev.  He said the rebels had beefed up positions around the port city of  Mariupol in the southeast, control of which would open up roads to  territory in southern Ukraine that some Western leaders say Russian  President Vladimir Putin hopes to claim.  The cease-fire agreed on Sept. 5 was intended to end a conflict  that has killed more than 4,000 people since the separatists rose  up in the mainly Russian-speaking east against the Western-looking  government in Kiev. It has been unraveling quickly since separatist  leaders were chosen in an election on Nov. 2 which the West said  was illegitimate because it violated the terms of the truce.  Syrian Kurds gain ground in Islamic State battle  Syrian Kurds backed by fighters from northern Iraq have gained  ground in breaking the siege of the Syrian border town of Kobani  but are drawing heavy fire from Islamic State insurgents and have  yet to win back control.  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said fierce  overnight clashes between Kurdish and Islamic State forces along  Kobani's southern front, combined with heavy artillery fire by  peshmerga, yielded new gains for the Kurds.  Calif. nurses strike ahead of Ebola-linked protest  Nearly 20,000 nurses went on strike in California on Tuesday  over patient care issues that include what their union views as  insufficient protection for nurses who may care for patients with  the Ebola virus, in a prelude to broader national protests expected  Wednesday.  The two-day strike targeted 86 hospitals and clinics operated by  Kaiser Permanente and two other hospitals, according to National  Nurses United. Most nurses Wednesday will not walk off the job, the  union said, but will hold vigils.  No jail time for priest in Chile who  abused girl  SANTIAGO, Chile -- An Irish-born priest, found guilty last month of  sexually abusing a child in his care at a religious school in  Santiago, will avoid jail time under a sentence handed down  Tuesday.  A judge sentenced John O'Reilly, who moved to Chile from Ireland in  1985, to four years and a day of ""supervised liberty"" for abusing  the pre-teen girl at the private Colegio Cumbres in the affluent  neighborhood of Las Condes between 2007 and 2009.  Mexican police probed in shooting of U.S. girl  MEXICO CITY -- Mexican authorities are investigating police in the  northern city of Reynosa on the Texas border after a pregnant  14-year-old American girl was shot during a high-speed car chase,  the local government said Tuesday.  The incident took place late Sunday near the bridge that links  Reynosa with the United States, when the girl and a friend were  pulling away from a convenience store, the attorney general's  office in the state of Tamaulipas said.

Abe reportedly will delay the increase in  the national sales tax to April 2017.  5 boys who allege sex abuse sue Mich. school  Five boys who allege they were sexually harassed or assaulted by a  teacher at a Michigan school filed suit against the school district  Tuesday, charging that the district failed to provide a safe  environment, a lawyer for the students said.  The suit was filed in federal court on behalf of five former  students at Grand Rapids University Prep Academy who say they were  harassed or assaulted by Jamila Williams, a former teacher. She was  sentenced to 8 to 15 years in prison.  U.S. airlines fighting Seattle wage increase  U.S. airlines are suing the Port of Seattle to block planned pay  increases for airport workers, in the latest legal battle over  efforts to better compensate workers in the state.  The Port of Seattle Commission, which runs the Seattle-Tacoma  airport, voted in July to hike the wage floor to $11.22 per hour in  January 2015 and $13 per hour in 2017 for airport employees.  Airlines for America, which represents major air carriers, argues  the increases conflict with labor agreements.  Gold pocket watch breaks auction record  GENEVA, Switzerland -- A gold pocket watch made by Patek Philippe  for a New York banker in the 1930s fetched $24 million at auction  Tuesday, smashing the record for a timepiece previously set 15  years ago, Sotheby's said.  Henry Graves commissioned the famed Swiss watchmaker to produce the  world's most complicated watch. The seller and buyer chose to  remain anonymous at the auction at a Geneva lakeside hotel, where  bidding continued for 15 suspenseful minutes.

103,1526110298.xml,"       The Obama administration's argument with the Kremlin over  the unrest in Ukraine has turned to a new dispute: whether heavily  armed men in a grainy Internet image are trigger-happy U.S.  mercenaries in Ukraine -- or a police SWAT team in New Orleans  after Hurricane Katrina. Russia has warned for weeks that U.S. security contractors like  those accused of killing 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007 have  been ordered into Ukraine to guide the interim government's  attempted crackdown on Russian-speaking separatists.    This month, corroboration seemed to appear in a photo that showed  five men dressed in black and carrying assault weapons on a  featureless city street.    State Department officials say the men were New Orleans police  officers or contractors trying to prevent looting after the 2005  hurricane. The photo, they say, was doctored by ""Kremlin-sponsored  websites"" to remove the sign of an American fast-food joint.    They did not identify the sites, but the photo rocketed around  social media.    ""The Internet is a wonderful thing, and eventually people can find  out where photographs came from,"" said Daniel Baer, the U.S.  ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe. ""The allegations that there are somehow 'U.S mercenaries'  operating in Ukraine are false.""    The clash is the latest fallout from what U.S. officials call  Russia's propaganda war in Ukraine. Russian officials and  supportive news organizations contend that Western governments  engineered the ouster of the pro-Russian president, Viktor  Yanukovych, in February, and are now trying to install a  pro-Western government in the capital, Kiev.    U.S. officials deny those charges, saying Yanukovych fled from a  popular uprising and that the West supports a presidential election  scheduled for Sunday.    ""The effort is to de-legitimize the authorities in Kiev, to say  that people with blood on their hands are calling the shots from  behind the scenes,"" said Andrew Weiss, a specialist on Russia and  Ukraine who is vice president for studies at Carnegie Endowment for  International Peace.    The Kremlin's top officials have seeded the suspicions. Sergey  Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, told the Bloomberg news agency  last Wednesday that reports of U.S. mercenaries in Ukraine ""might  be true.""    Andre Kelin, Russia's ambassador to the OSCE, a 57-nation group  monitoring developments in Ukraine, made similar allegations.    Despite U.S. denials, the allegations have spread around the world.    The tabloid Bild am Sonntag, the largest-selling German national  Sunday newspaper, reported that German intelligence officials  informed Chancellor Angela Merkel's office that 400 U.S.  mercenaries, hired from Academi, the corporate descendants of the  defunct Blackwater security firm, are on the ground near Slovyansk  in eastern Ukraine.    The White House labeled the stories ""nonsense.""    German officials neither confirmed nor denied the account, saying  they don't comment on intelligence matters.    In April, Russian officials and news outlets reported that CIA  chief John Brennan was visiting Ukraine, citing it as proof that  Washington is puppet master for the ""fascist junta"" in Kiev.    CIA officials at first denied the visit. Then the White House  confirmed it, though officials disputed Russian claims that the CIA  is trying to run Ukraine's security operations.    U.S. diplomats can expose Russian manipulations of the truth, but  they're not likely to deter Moscow from trying to make its case,  according to Weiss.    ""This is cardinal to the way Russia pursues foreign policy,"" he  said. ""We're in a relentless propaganda war of attrition.""    ----------  prichter@tribune.com Credit: By Paul Richter, Tribune Washington Bureau  ",2014-05-21
104,1967795334.xml,"Opposition calls for direct talks with Syria government BEIRUT -- Syria opposition representatives meeting in the Saudi Arabian capital called Thursday for direct and unconditional negotiations with the Syrian government over the civil war that would lead to the launch of a transition period.The opposition didn't condition its participation in upcoming United Nations-based negotiations on the departure of President Bashar Assad from office, signaling a degree of flexibility. The issue has always been the sticking point in previous rounds of talks, deepening division among an already fragmented opposition.However, in the final communique obtained by The Associated Press, opposition representatives said a peaceful and unbiased transition period will not be possible without Assad first leaving office.""We set our negotiation goals. We didn't put down conditions,"" said Ahmed Ramadan, an opposition member of the Syrian National Council said.Ramadan said different opposition groups with divergent view points on Assad's role in the transition period have found common ground. A unified delegation for the Geneva talks will be announced later Thursday.It is now up to the government to show seriousness, Ramadan added.Meanwhile, the chief of the Russian General Staff said Russia is likely to scale down its military presence in Syria ""significantly"" before the year's end.Moscow embarked on an air campaign in Syria in October 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad and helped turnthe tide in Assad's favor.Gen.

Sheriff says Las Vegas gunman fired more than 1,100 roundsLAS VEGAS -- The top lawman in Las Vegas said the gunman who killed dozens of people at a concert last month fired more than 1,100 rounds.The newly released estimate from Sheriff Joe Lombardo offers more detail about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department's forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence.Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the music festival before killing himself.Lombardo said authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite. Myanmar, Bangladesh sign Rohingya refugees agreementBANGKOK -- Myanmar and Bangladesh signed an agreement Thursday covering the return of Rohingya Muslims who fled across their mutual border to escape violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state.Myanmar announced the agreement but provided no details on how many Rohingya refugees would be allowed to return home. Bangladesh said the repatriations are to begin within two months.More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when the army began what it called ""clearance operations"" following an attack on police posts by a group of Rohingya insurgents. Refugees arriving in Bangladesh said their homes were set on fire by soldiers and Buddhist mobs. Pressure grows on German Social Democrats in impasseBERLIN -- Pressure grew Thursday within Germany's Social Democratic Party to at least discuss the possibility of forming a new government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, after her talks with other parties collapsed over the weekend.SPD leader Martin Schulz ruled out returning to the current ""grand coalition"" with Merkel after leading his party to a disastrous result in September's election but appeared to soften his stance before a meeting Thursday with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who has urged politicians to compromise.""The SPD is fully aware of its responsibility in the current difficult situation,"" Schulz told news agency dpa.

Lebanon PM assures bankers stability comes firstBEIRUT -- Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri assured regional bankers on Thursday that Lebanon's stability was his top concern, one day after walking back his shock resignation that threw his country into turmoil.Hariri told the Arab Banking Conference in Beirut that his government would prioritize Lebanon's interests over regional challenges and stressed a return to the country's official policy of neutrality in regional affairs.Hariri stunned Lebanon and the region by resigning on Nov. 4 while in Saudi Arabia, raising fears of market panic and recession.But he told President Michel Aoun on Wednesday that he would stay on to allow for ""consultations"" that would seek to safeguard the tiny country's delicate political system, stretched by competing agendas in Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. nuclear inspector: Iran complying with dealVIENNA, Austria -- The head of the U.N. agency monitoring Iran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and five other nations says Tehran is living up to its end of the agreement -- comments that indirectly oppose President Donald Trump's view.The U.S. president refused last month to certify Iran's compliance, saying the benefits Tehran is getting from the deal are not proportional to its concessions.Iran limited its nuclear program in exchange for an end to nuclear-related sanctions, but legislation now is pending before Congress that would attach additional conditions for existing U.S. sanctions relief -- a move Tehran says would violate the pact.Yukiya Amano told the agency's 35-nation board that the ""commitments being undertaken by Iran are being implemented.""

105,420150901.xml,"         They know ""it's the economy, stupid.""    How could they not know? With an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent swelling the jobless ranks to 5 million, zero-growth stagnation and a budget deficit that will grow to $75 billion next year, the German economy has been the elephant in the room. It is the only real issue in the current election campaign.    But what the ruling Social Democrats (SDP) and the rival Christian Democratic Union (CDU) don't know is how to convince voters that either party has a workable solution.    Heading into Sunday's election, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has cut deeply into challenger Angela Merkel's seemingly insurmountable lead, narrowing the gap from 22 percentage points three months ago to 6 earlier this week. But what is even more remarkable is that only three days before the election 23 percent of voters said they had not decided for whom to vote.    Merkel is still heavily favored to become Germany's first female chancellor and the first to have come of age in the former East Germany, but less certain is whether she will win by enough to avoid having to form a messy coalition with the SDP.    Two televised debates have only added to the confusion.    'She was good enough'    In the first debate, Schroeder, as expected, gave his usual smooth performance before the cameras, but Merkel more than held her own.    ""She was better than expected. She was good enough,"" said Gero Neugebauer, an elections expert at Berlin Free University. ""But two or three days after the debate, people were thinking, 'He [Schroeder] has more passion, more leadership qualities.'""    Schroeder spoke of the need to implement economic reforms, something he has labored mightily to do, only to have the mood of the country turn sour on his party.    Borrowing a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook during the 1980 presidential debate with Jimmy Carter, Merkel appealed directly to viewers, asking whether ""our country is better off than it was seven years ago.""    Merkel said she wants to create jobs by making German businesses more flexible and competitive. Her reform package includes a sharp cut in the amount employers contribute to social welfare benefits and to make up for the cuts by raising the value-added tax by 2 percent.    In the final week of the campaign, the reform debate has crystallized around Paul Kirchhof, 62, a university professor Merkel has tapped as a potential future finance minister. Kirchhof is an advocate of a 25 percent flat income tax, which may be a change too extreme even for Merkel.    ""Even if people agree with the need for reforms, they are uncertain about the flat tax,"" Neugebauer said. ""They are starting to fear that they could be the losers in this reform.""    Schroeder has scented this fear and is playing it for all it is worth.    William Drozdiak, president of the American Council on Germany, said the chancellor's argument is simple: If you think our reform package was painful, wait till you see theirs.    ""Schroeder is a very effective campaigner, and he is scaring people,"" Drozdiak said.    When Schroeder trailed in the 2002 campaign, he rescued his chances by playing the anti-American card, vociferously opposing the invasion of Iraq and vowing to keep German troops out.    He appears to be hoping the tactic can work again. During the first debate, he reminded voters that he has kept Germany out of ""superfluous wars.""    The family angle    For her part, Merkel has tried to keep the campaign focused on domestic issues, promising tax breaks to encourage Germans to have more babies.    ""Our birthrate is now half of what it was in 1965. When I am chancellor, family values will be enshrined in our tax system,"" the twice-married mother of none said at the first debate.    The counterattack was left to Doris Schroeder-Koepf, the chancellor's fourth wife and mother of their adopted child.    Schroeder-Koepf said Merkel, a former physicist, did not understand what life was like for ordinary German women.    ""They are busy trying to juggle a family and career, or deciding whether to spend a few years at home after having a baby or wondering how best to bring up their children,"" she told Die Zeit, a political weekly. ""This is not Angela Merkel's world.""    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: Election posters in Mainz, Germany, depict party leaders, including Christian Democrat Angela Merkel (left) and Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, the incumbent chancellor (second from right).

106,1878129975.xml,"After more than a decade in office, German Chancellor Angela  Merkel has become the most important American ally in continental  Europe and, by far, the region's most powerful leader. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump derided Merkel's  open-arms refugee policy as a ""disaster,"" questioned her  trustworthiness and threatened to impose import penalties on German  car makers.On policy, they disagree on immigration and refugees, a resurgent  Russia, global trade deals and the European Union.On Friday, President Donald Trump will welcome Merkel to the White  House for their first sit-down summit in what both sides see as a  chance to seek common ground and restore stability in  trans-Atlantic relations.""The stakes for this meeting, ... and for this relationship even  more so, are very high,"" said Heather Conley, Europe program  director at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International  Studies in Washington.The two are expected to discuss strengthening the NATO military  alliance, collaborating in the fight against terrorism and Islamic  State, and taking steps to resolve the conflicts in Syria and  Ukraine, where Russia has intervened.Merkel, who has been chancellor since 2005, has met with Russian  President Vladimir Putin more often than any other foreign leader,  and U.S. officials believe she has more than held her own.A senior Trump administration official, who briefed reporters last  week on condition of anonymity, said Trump ""will be very interested  in hearing the chancellor's views on her experience interacting  with Putin.""Previous U.S. administrations have viewed Germany as a bulwark  against Russian aggression in an increasingly troubled Europe and  the glue that holds together U.S.-European sanctions against Moscow  following its 2014 seizure of Crimea.After Trump appeared to suggest he might ease sanctions on Russia,  German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen warned Washington at  last month's Munich Security Conference, with Vice President Mike  Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis in attendance, not to  attempt to forge a separate deal with Moscow.Administration officials have since said sanctions would remain in  place.On trade, the United States has a trade deficit with Germany, its  largest trading partner in Europe. The Trump administration has  accused Germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak  euro.The two leaders have clashed on spending for the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, the military alliance created to counter  Soviet advances during the Cold War and now used to help fight the  Taliban in Afghanistan and to block Russian pressure in Eastern  Europe.Senior administration officials last week said they were encouraged  that Germany had agreed to boost its annual defense spending by  more than 5 percent to $39 billion.But German defense spending is still below the NATO target of 2  percent of annual economic output. The U.S. spent about 3.6 percent  of GDP on defense last year, and Trump wants to boost it by $54  billion, or 10 percent.Merkel's visit to Washington comes at a tumultuous time in Europe.Following Britain's referendum in June to withdraw from the  European Union, regional agreements are in danger of unraveling,  and nationalist populist parties have gained in several countries.In France, a political shake-up appears likely after elections that  begin on April 23. Top establishment candidates have dropped out,  leaving radical nationalist leader Marine Le Pen among the three  remaining contenders.In the U.K., Prime Minister Theresa May won a parliamentary battle  this week to start the so-called Brexit talks, a move that risks  damaging the British economy and European unity. And Scottish  leader Nicola Sturgeon called for a new referendum on Scottish  independence, which could dismember Great Britain.Putin has evinced support for Le Pen in France, as well as for the  German nationalist party that could complicate Merkel's attempt to  win a fourth term as chancellor in September.All these developments have thrust Europe into uncertain territory,  with the added unknown of an unpredictable U.S. administration.----------tracy.wilkinson@latimes.com <CAPTION: Photo: Germany's Angela Merkel meets Friday in Washington with  President Trump.

107,904876640.xml,"      There's something atavistic about our culture's fascination with presidential sons and daughters. Do we consider them a kind of faux royalty, as American princes and princesses? Or do network executives (and book publishers) detect genuine power in the children of presidents that the more discerning miss? Take Chelsea Clinton: If so much of what passes for network news is about celebrity wrangling, would any world leader, corporate chief or movie star dare turn down an invitation from her to appear on NBC lest they offend her parents? Especially seeing that NBC has assigned Clinton to a feel-good news beat, there will be no downside to agreeing to talking to her on camera. As an NBC reporter, she won't be a rainmaker. She'll be a typhoon, flooding the airwaves with one big celebrity ""get"" after another. The hiring of Chelsea Clinton doesn't so much debase the TV news currency as reveal its true value. -- Jack Shafer, Reuters Last week's election indicates that the GOP marriage with the white working class is on the rocks. That's bad news, since the epic Republican landslide in 2010 was fueled by record-high margins among these voters. ... On issue after issue, the opinions of the GOP's conservative base are out of step with those of white working-class independents. The chief example is the Ohio referendum that repealed the GOP's elimination of public-sector unions' collective bargaining rights. ... The GOP base voter believes the deficit is as large a problem as the economy; the white working-class independent does not. The GOP base voter believes cutting entitlements is necessary to cut the deficit and that taxes on the rich should not be raised; the white working-class independent disagrees. ... The GOP base voter scorns Occupy Wall Street; the white working-class independent thinks the Occupiers have something of a point. -- Henry Olsen, The Weekly Standard It's a noble-sounding idea: Pull your money out of one of the big, risk-taking, profit-driven corporate banks whose speculation helped ruin our economy, and put it in a non-profit, community-minded credit union. ... The Credit Union National Association estimates that 650,000 people opened new credit union accounts in the month after Bank of America's (now rescinded) debit fee announcement. That adds up to about $4.5 billion in new savings accounts -- a significant chunk of cash, though probably not enough on its own to affect the big banks' bottom lines. In fact, it's possible the transfers could help banks like Chase and BofA, at least in the short term. Hank Israel, a retail bank expert for the management consulting firm Novantas, explained that big banks make most of their money on their wealthiest clients. They actually lose money on some of their basic free-checking customers, especially since new overdraft regulations and the Durbin amendment have limited the fees they can charge. -- Will Oremus, Slate Make jury service voluntary rather than compulsory and mostly what we'd lose is a costly, time-consuming ideal -- the fair cross-section of the community -- which we currently honor by immediately trying to undermine it with the costly, time-consuming process of voir dire. ... According to the National Center for State Courts, approximately 32 million people are summoned for jury duty each year. Meanwhile, only 1.5 million people actually end up serving on federal and state court juries. The 30.5 million who don't serve merely increase costs without adding much value except the short-lived ""cross-section"" illusion. Surely we could find 3 or 4 million prospective jurors to fill those 1.5 million seats through a purely voluntary system if we raised the standard juror pay to, say, $100 a day, reduced the time allotted to voir dire, and offered those who do show up to court a much higher chance of actually sitting on a jury. -- Greg Beato, Reason ""If the euro fails, Europe fails."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it many times since the beginning of the euro-zone crisis, as a way of underlining the preposterousness of either idea. Now the words seem like a prophecy. ... The end of the European dream of integration would be the end of the free world as we've known it. It sounds dramatic, but it's true. The European Union, a peaceful bloc of 500 million people rebuilt from the ashes of two catastrophic wars, has exemplified the best kind of globalization. While Americans like to think of Europeans as ponderous and ineffectual, Europe has the power to do things -- to take the lead in liberating Libya, to push forward efforts to curb climate change, to help the U.S. defend liberal democracy. A hobbled Europe means less support for many of the things that Americans hold dear. In that sense, if Europe fails, we do too. -- Rana Foroohar, Time Caption: Photo: (Chelsea) Clinton  ",2011-11-19
108,420695489.xml,"      If, as some versions of the conventional wisdom would have it, President George W. Bush has wrecked the trans-Atlantic relationship beyond repair, it certainly wasn't showing during his final, valedictory trip to key European capitals last week: no mass demonstrations, no open letters in the newspapers denouncing America as a superpower out of control. Even the tone has changed. In an interview with the Times of London, the president was applauded for adopting language ""much less jarring, more conciliatory than it once was."" ""His humor is self-deprecating,"" the paper said. This is a marked change from the characterizations that had become so familiar. The ""Toxic Texan"" with his ""cowboy diplomacy"" seems to many over here a distant memory. And on his last trip to Europe, Bush might just have achieved something that had hitherto eluded him. With his newfound support for climate-change policy, his emphasis on a multilateral approach to Iran and his commitment, however belated, to engagement with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bush comes across as being constructive: a man to do business with. He looks like a statesman. Of course, few in Europe will forgive Bush for Iraq. The cliches do still fly from the pens of some, especially on the anti-American left. But the reality is that the damage to the trans-Atlantic relationship that Bush has been accused of inflicting no longer looks as permanent as it once did. Seasoned observers are starting to pull back. Where once the discussion about George Bush's America was black and white, now there are shades of gray. The editorial page editor of the European edition of The Wall Street Journal, Matthew Kaminski,  in a marvelously counterintuitive piece last week, even argued that in some respects things had never been better. ""So how's this for an inconvenient truth,"" Kaminski wrote. ""This American president will bequeath his successor an alliance with Europe as robust and healthy as at any time in the post-Cold War period."" Will he? In terms of high politics, Mr.  Kaminski has a point. The leaders of Europe's ""big three"" -- France, Germany and Britain -- are all, in their different ways, committed to working constructively with America. The new administration of Gordon Brown,  successor to Tony Blair as British prime minister, has been at pains to stress that Britain's ""most important bilateral relationship is with the U.S."" Angela Merkel,  chancellor of Germany, is far more supportive of the United States than her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder. As for France, the Economist magazine put it well in March in saying that the country's new leader, Nicolas Sarkozy,  ""is arguably the most pro-American president in French history.""  Sarkozy has even pledged to bring France back inside NATO's integrated military command, 42 years  after Charles de Gaulle pulled out in a fit of anti-American pique. The makeup of the so-called ""Euro-Atlantic structures"" has also changed in America's favor. The slew of formerly communist nations that have been incorporated into NATO and the European Union bring broadly pro-American instincts. Among other effects, this has largely destroyed the hopes of some that the EU might one day emerge as a rival to American hegemony. The great lesson for Europe from the Iraq War -- when the former communist countries and Britain sided with the United States while a group led by France and Germany were opposed -- is that attempts to oppose the U.S. will divide Europe rather than unite it. However, none of this can alter the fact that America's image among ordinary Europeans has taken a pummeling. According to opinion surveys by the German Marshall Fund of the United States,  European views of the benefits of American leadership in the world have plummeted from a high of 64 percent in 2002 to just 36 percent in 2007. While the same surveys  found that a third of Europeans directly attribute the souring of the tone of trans-Atlantic relations to Bush himself, that still leaves plenty of room for discussion about the extent to which America's image has suffered lasting damage. With that in mind, much could depend on which of the presidential candidates emerges victorious. Europeans have tended to favor Democrats, and there is evidence that Bush's personal unpopularity has further hardened opinion against Republicans. In a recent poll of five major European countries for Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper, 52 percent backed Barack Obama, compared with just 15 percent for John McCain. Whoever gets the presidency, relations across the Atlantic will also be driven by the great global challenges of our time. If America concludes that military force is ultimately the only way to deal with Iran, that inevitably will run up against Europe's more pacifist instincts. America's tendency to side with democratic Israel against the dictatorships of the Middle East is not always welcomed in Europe and will remain a source of tension. Whatever happens, it seems both sides will want to put the bickering of the last eight years behind them. There will be a lot of goodwill toward the next American president. How that is used will be up to him. ---------- Robin Shepherd is senior fellow for Europe  at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. rshepherd@chathamhouse.org.uk Caption: Photo (color): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, President George W.

109,1435041828.xml,"       Study: Slight rebound in migrants in U.S. illegally The exodus of immigrants who were in the United States illegally  has halted -- and the tide may actually be turning, according to a  new report.    An analysis by the Pew Research Center finds that the number of  immigrants living illegally in the U.S. -- mostly people who  arrived without valid documents or overstayed their visas -- has  held steady and may even have grown slightly beginning in 2009.    Earlier Pew research found that the numbers plunged by nearly a  million during the economic downturn.    The new estimates show a slight rebound in this immigrant  population between 2009 and 2012, with the ranks growing from 11.3  million to 11.7 million -- still below the 2007 peak of 12.2  million.    Researchers cautioned it isn't clear if immigrant numbers are  rising because the estimates aren't exact and the recent increase  isn't statistically significant. However, the population drop seems  to have ""bottomed out,"" they wrote.    Pew calculated the number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally by  subtracting the estimated number of legally authorized immigrants  from the number of people living in the U.S. who were born in  foreign countries, as measured in Census Bureau surveys.    The flow of such immigrants has differed from state to state, Pew  found:    In Texas, their numbers never fell. In California, New York and  Illinois, the numbers dropped and have not rebounded. The report  zeroed in on the states that draw the biggest numbers of immigrants  living in the country illegally.    Australia clamps down on data about asylum seekers    Australia's government said Monday it would no longer provide  regular information on asylum boats turned away or on emergencies  at sea involving asylum seekers under a military operation to curb  human trafficking.    Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would no  longer provide full briefings on border protection incidents to  safeguard operational security. The steady flow of refugee boats is  a hot political issue in Australia, while stoking tension with  neighbors like Indonesia and Sri Lanka.    U.N. reports big progress in fight against AIDS    LONDON -- The global rate of HIV infection and the number of  AIDS-related deaths have been dramatically reduced, thanks to  expanding access to treatment, the United Nations said in a report  issued Monday.    In its annual update on HIV, which it said now infects around 35.3  million people worldwide, UNAIDS said deaths from AIDS and HIV  infection rates were falling, while the number of people getting  treatment is going up.   Pakistanis protest church violence PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Pakistani Christians protest the  Sunday suicide bombings in All Saints Church of Pakistan in  Peshawar on Monday. The death toll from two suicide bombings rose  to 85. Christians across the country protested for better  protection for their community.  Man who won jackpot was out on an errand    CHARLESTON, S.C. -- The winner of a nearly $400 million Powerball  jackpot has declined to be named, lottery officials said Monday,  but they said the winner, who lives near Columbia, S.C., told them  he bought the ticket while on a mission to buy hot dog buns.    The man stopped at a gasoline station after his wife asked him to  pick up the hot dog buns, but after finding they had none, he  bought Powerball tickets instead, the officials said.    Colorado flood search narrowed to 6 missing    DENVER -- Search teams in flood-ravaged areas of Colorado have  accounted for all but half a dozen people among hundreds who were  missing after the disaster nearly two weeks ago, and authorities on  Monday reported finding the body of an eighth victim.    Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden surveyed the devastated region  by helicopter and pledged that disaster relief would continue even  if there is a government budget shutdown.    The Newsmaker    Merkel tasked with forming new coalition    Fresh from her party's best election showing in more than 20 years,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel started the tricky task Monday of  forming a new government after her preferred coalition partner was  ousted.    Senior IRS official in targeting scandal retires    WASHINGTON -- A former senior Internal Revenue Service official who  was a key figure in the controversy over IRS scrutiny of  conservative groups has retired, the tax agency said Monday.    ""We can confirm today that Lois Lerner has retired,"" the agency  said in a statement regarding the status of the former head of its  tax-exempt division. The agency declined to comment further.    Lerner had been placed on leave in May at the peak of the  controversy.    Mexican border city attack kills 10 people    MEXICO CITY -- A group of gunmen shot dead 10 people, including a  6-year-old girl, on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez, a troubled  Mexican city on the U.S. border that has been wracked by violent  drug traffickers.    The attorney general's office in Chihuahua state said on Monday  that seven men and two women died with the child after the gunmen  pulled up in a vehicle and began shooting at the group, which was  celebrating after a baseball game late Sunday.    Girl in custody battle given to adoptive family    OKLAHOMA CITY -- A 4-year-old Cherokee girl known as ""Baby  Veronica,"" the child at the heart of a cross-country custody  battle, was handed back over to her adoptive, non-Indian family  Monday, a Cherokee Nation spokeswoman said.    The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the girl  to be transferred from the custody of her biological father in  Oklahoma with whom she has lived for nearly two years.

110,1820563411.xml,"       Syrian cease-fire near collapse after Saturday coalition strike BEIRUT -- A U.S.-Russian cease-fire deal for Syria was on the brink of collapse Sunday after a week of mishaps and setbacks that exposed the fragility of the plan.    The cease-fire is premised on a series of trust-building exercises intended to culminate Monday in the launch of preparations between the United States and Russia for joint airstrikes against terrorist groups in Syria.    Instead, an errant strike Saturday by the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State that killed dozens of Syrian government soldiers has exposed the deficit of trust between the two powers.    Whether U.S. warplanes conducted the attack is in question. The U.S.-led coalition is made up of 67 countries, more than a dozen of which carry out airstrikes against the militants. The Defense Department of Australia acknowledged in a statement Sunday that its warplanes had participated in a strike Saturday in Deir el-Zour, the eastern Syrian city where the attack occurred, on a front line between the Syrian army and the Islamic State that has changed hands many times.    But the strike sent tensions soaring between Moscow and Washington, the chief sponsors of the truce.    On Sunday, Russia continued its verbal assaults on the United States, with a Russian Foreign Ministry statement accusing the pilots who carried out the strike of acting ""on the boundary between criminal negligence and connivance with Islamic State terrorists.""    In Aleppo on Sunday, warplanes dropped barrel bombs on four residential neighborhoods, upending the relative calm that has prevailed there for a week. Aid convoys remained stalled on the Turkish border for a sixth consecutive day.  Ruling United Russia party leads in parliamentary election    MOSCOW -- Early results on Sunday showed Russia's ruling United Russia party winning in the parliamentary election amid reports of election violations.    With more than 22 percent of the ballots counted, United Russia was recording 50.3 percent of the vote for party-list seats and far ahead in district contests.    The Liberal Democrats and Communists were both recording about 15 percent and A Just Russia 6 percent. Neither of two parties that openly oppose President Vladimir Putin was seen making it into the parliament.    The election for the 450-seat State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is unlikely to substantially change the distribution of power, in which the United Russia party has long held an absolute majority.    Massive demonstrations broke out in Moscow after the last Duma election in 2011.  Philippines leader: Government may need to lengthen drug war    MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippines' president said Sunday that he may need to extend a government anti-drug campaign that has left more than 3,000 people dead.    Acknowledging that he may not be able to keep his campaign promise to eradicate illegal drugs in no more than six months, President Rodrigo Duterte said in jest that, with the huge number of people involved, ""even if I wanted to, I cannot kill them all.""    Duterte said at a news conference in the southern city of Davao that he was overwhelmed by the enormity of the problem and may need to extend his self-imposed deadline by another six months to end the scourge. He won the May 9 election on an ambitious promise to end corruption and crime, especially illegal drugs, in three to six months.  Poll: German chancellor's party takes hit in Berlin state election    BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's party endured a state-election setback Sunday, according to exit-poll projections.    The Social Democrats, SPD, and Merkel's Christian Democratic Party, CDU, emerged from the Berlin state election as the strongest parties, but both lost enough support that they won't be able to continue a coalition government, the projections show.    The SPD won 21.6 percent of the vote, dropping 6.7 percent, while the CDU won 17.5 percent, down 5.8 percent, ARD public television reported.    At the same time, the anti-capitalist Left Party gained 4 percent to 15.7 percent overall, and new nationalist anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD, easily entered its 10th state parliament with 14.1 percent of the vote.  Palestinian stabs Israeli army officer in West Bank    JERUSALEM -- A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli army officer in the chest near a West Bank settlement on Sunday, wounding him before Israeli soldiers shot the attacker and apprehended him, the military said.    The incident followed a weekend surge in Palestinian attacks that shattered weeks of relative calm.    Four Palestinians, one of whom held Jordanian citizenship, were shot dead over the weekend during assaults on Israelis, according to Israeli authorities. The spike in violence has spurred the Israeli military to send troop reinforcements to the West Bank.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the potential for violence could rise as the Jewish high holidays approach. On Sunday, he instructed police to beef up forces in Jerusalem and its holy sites.  Militants kill 17 India soldiers in Kashmir base attack    NEW DELHI -- In one of the deadliest attacks in the disputed region of Kashmir, heavily armed militants stormed an Indian army base near the border with Pakistan on Sunday, killing 17 soldiers.    India's home minister, Rajnath Singh, in comments on Twitter, appeared to accuse Pakistan of being behind the attack.    ""I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan's continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups,"" he said.    India's director-general of military operations, Lt. Gen. Ranbir Singh, said in a televised statement that the militants were ""foreign terrorists"" carrying items with ""Pakistani markings.""    A spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry for Foreign Affairs rejected the allegations. Four militants were killed in the ensuing fighting, said a spokesman for the army's Northern Command.  Thai boat accident: At least 13 people were killed Sunday when a passenger boat carrying more than 100 people capsized after a collision in a river north of Bangkok, Thai media reported. More than 30 people were hospitalized, but an unknown number were still missing. It was not immediately clear what the boat collided with.  Actress dies: Charmian Carr, best known for portraying the eldest von Trapp daughter in Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""The Sound of Music,"" died Saturday. She was 73. Carr died of complications from a rare form of dementia in Los Angeles, spokesman Harlan Boll said. She performed the song ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen.""

111,1901727188.xml,"From the hushed halls of government to cobblestoned streets and plazas across the Continent, Europeans are greeting Donald Trump’s first visit with considerable skepticism, no small degree of apprehension - and even overt hostility.
The president’s inaugural overseas trip, which began Friday in Saudi Arabia, has so far been dominated by friendly encounters with Mideast leaders, who feted and praised Trump as a canny deal-maker and wise statesman. At a sideline meeting in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the U.S. leader voiced enthusiastic agreement when Egypt’s president called him “a unique personality … capable of doing the impossible.”
But in Europe, the reception is likely to be quite different.
Protesters were set to march in Brussels, encouraged by organizers to wear pink cat-ear hats. A respected German newsweekly said America under Trump was a “laughingstock,” and called for his removal from office. A French author mused that “we just don’t take him seriously.” And in Rome, where Trump landed Tuesday, some saw echoes of Italy’s own flamboyant ex-prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.
For whoever occupies the White House, policy differences with Europe - sometimes vehement ones - are nothing new. But Trump’s first visit as president prompted a wave of trepidation not only over issues ranging from climate change to women’s roles in society, but also his impulsive mode of governance and mercurial temperament.
Trump has held face-to-face talks already with several European leaders in Washington, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. Even so, there was palpable anxiety in advance of his scheduled arrival on Wednesday in Brussels, the Belgian capital and seat of institutions like the European Union and NATO.
“In Brussels, people seem to be walking on eggshells, hoping nothing controversial will happen during the visit,” said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. “This is not how the first visit of the president of Europe’s most important partner should feel.”
Trump has fans and political allies on this side of the Atlantic, of course. Europeans whose views tend to echo those of the president’s backers at home - those who mistrust the political establishment, or feel left behind by globalization, or hold hard-line views on immigration, for example - welcome this U.S. president as a breath of fresh air.
“I like him!” declared Marco Bouquet, a 56-year-old manager at a Rome tobacconist. “He makes decisions and doesn’t waste time.”
But recent European election results, as well as public opinion polling, suggest the U.S. president’s brand of nationalistic populism alienates large swaths of the European public.
The scandals that Trump left behind in Washington scarcely intruded during five days in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Even in Israel, where intelligence professionals were furious over reports of Trump’s casual passing of classified information to visiting Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the only one who brought up the matter publicly was Trump himself - telling his hosts that he hadn’t mentioned Israel.
In European capitals, though, the fast-moving developments on investigations into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russia during last year’s election have been prime topics for discussion, with many wondering if his presidency can weather the storm.
“The man is his own worst enemy,” German public-television correspondent Ulf Roeller said in a commentary last week from the U.S. capital. “Many in Washington are asking how long this can go on.”
On his European swing, Trump will meet leaders with whom he is a study in contrasts, such as France’s newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old who is known for his intellectual bent. The two are scheduled to lunch together on Thursday, when Trump will hold a day of talks with officials from NATO and the European Union, both of which he has disparaged in the past.
Even the devastating news out of Manchester, England, where a bombing at a pop concert on Monday night left 22 people dead, illustrated European leaders’ stark stylistic differences with Trump. While most of them offered up solemn condolences and expressions of solidarity to the British government and the victims, the U.S. president employed unusually informal language to deride those who stage terrorist attacks as “losers.”
Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, spoke approvingly in a CNBC interview of the lack of visible protests in Saudi Arabia - failing to note that any anti-Trump demonstrators would have faced harsh punishment, even if they could have gotten anywhere near the president.
But in Brussels, more than 70 organizations were planning to march Wednesday under the slogan “Trump Not Welcome” - hoping, organizers said, to send a message to Belgium’s homegrown right-wing politicians as well.
“Donald Trump has this extraordinary ability to unite a very large number of opponents against him,” Leila Lahssaini, a spokeswoman for the protest, told the Belgian broadcaster RTBF. Taking a page from women’s marches in Washington and elsewhere on the day after Trump was inaugurated, organizers encouraged marchers to wear pink knit hats with cat ears to evoke his famous boast about grabbing women by their genitals.
In Rome, Trump’s arrival triggered operatic complaints about a worsening of the Eternal City’s eternal traffic jams, but also sparked unease about the U.S. leader’s fitness to lead.
“He doesn’t seem to be very intelligent,” said Nache Ezeiza, a 30-year-old clerk in a store near Rome’s Trevi Fountain. She said Trump reminded her of Berlusconi, whose legal and political woes finally forced him from office.
Germany, mindful of its past as the aggressor in two world wars of the last century, seemed more worried than most of its European neighbors about far-right movements and figures being emboldened by Trump. German media reports have had a strong anti-Trump undercurrent, culminating with a demand this week from the editor in chief of Germany’s leading weekly news magazine, Der Spiegel, for the U.S. president’s ouster.
In a signed editorial, editor Klaus Brinkbaeumer called Trump “a liar, a racist and a cheat” who had made a “laughingstock” of the United States. He added: “He must be removed from the White House before things get even worse.”
Political scientists in Germany cited the country’s Nazi past as inspiring revulsion over any indication of tyrannical behavior in leaders at home or abroad.
“Germans have had their own historical experience, and grow up on the lookout for even the slightest signs of a dictator, because we have this ‘nie wieder’ idea - ‘That can never be allowed to happen again,’” said Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at Goettingen University.
Many ordinary Germans expressed angst over Trump, but some said it was too soon to pass judgment. “He’s said a lot of totally outrageous things - I was surprised Americans elected him,” said Hartmut Meyer, a 56-year-old truck mechanic in Berlin. “But at least he seems to be learning a bit as he goes on.”
In neighboring France, media commentary about Trump's presidency has generally been more restrained than in Germany, but outlets have followed in minute detail the succession of White House crises.
""The Trump presidency is in complete chaos,"" Le Monde, considered the country’s most cerebral newspaper, declared in a May 17 editorial. ""The controversies are accumulating…. Every day that passes brings a new ‘affaire.’”
French author Marie-Cecile Naves, who has written a book about populism and Trump, said France’s own repudiation of far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen in this month’s election may have settled nerves somewhat. And the French public may see Trump’s struggles with Congress and the U.S. courts as a check on more extreme policy measures.
“The more time passes, the less afraid we become,” she said. “In general, we just don’t take him seriously.”
Whatever their sentiments, European leaders can almost certainly be counted upon to follow norms of diplomatic behavior in dealing with a visiting American head of state, analysts said.
“There are general concerns that Donald Trump as an individual is simply not suitable for the job, but there is also a recognition that he was legitimately elected president of the U.S.,” said Nicholas Dungan, a senior research fellow at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.
In official circles, he said, “that will be the attitude … nothing other than the proper respect that the president of the United States deserves.”

112,1944178328.xml,"For all its orderly, prosperous modernity, Germany remains shadowed by memories of World War II and the horrors of Nazism. Now, for the first time in the country's postwar history, a far-right party -- with a roster that includes some candidates who embraced anti-Semitism and espoused neo-Nazi views -- will enter the lower house of Parliament, or Bundestag. Alternative for Germany, known by its initials AfD, won 12.6 percent of the vote in Sunday's election, coming in third place after the conservative Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats.As AfD backers celebrated the party's performance at the polls, where it garnered nearly 6 million votes, protesters gathered outside its Berlin headquarters and chanted anti-Nazi slogans.Here are some facts about the party and what its crossing of the parliamentary threshold means for Germany and the rest of Europe.What are the Alternative for Germany party's beliefs?Some of the party's nationalist-populist campaign tenets might sound familiar to American voters. AfD's message is staunchly anti-immigration, fueled by periodic eruptions of anti-Muslim sentiment. It opposes closer ties to the European Union, disdains globalism and rails against Germany's political establishment. It is a self-described champion of law and order, particularly in the context of terrorism and security. It despises foreign bailouts and preaches the message that Germany is being taken advantage of economically by its neighbors. It scorns the customary language of social inclusiveness and revels in rhetoric that could be politely described as politically incorrect.Hailing the vote result, one of the party's leaders, Alexander Gauland, vowed to ""take back our country and our people.""How did this party get started?The party was founded in 2013, cobbled together under the umbrella of vehement opposition to the European Union and its common currency, the euro, together with sharp condemnations of German taxpayer funding of bailouts for what was seen as a feckless Greece. But it was the AfD's anti-immigrant stance that put it on the map. Buoyed by public angst accompanying the influx of about 1 million refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in 2015 and 2016, the party's support at one point was polling in the neighborhood of 15 percent, but it did not achieve that in the vote.Is this part of a nationalist wave?When Britain voted in June 2016 to exit the European Union, and Donald Trump won the presidency in November, many wondered whether those votes prefigured a Europe-wide populist wave. But Dutch extremist Geert Wilders' performance fell short of expectations in the Netherlands' March parliamentary vote, and far-right standard-bearer Marine Le Pen was soundly defeated in France's presidential election in May.Even so, populists remain a force to be reckoned with, ever poised to capitalize on woes such as terrorist attacks and economic problems. Le Pen was among the first to offer the AfD her congratulations.What does it mean for the rest of Europe?Some of the ground that AfD gained in this election came at the expense of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union party, leaving her in a weakened position as she forms a coalition government.France's president, Emmanuel Macron, is embarking on a major push for greater European integration and badly wants Merkel's support in reforming and shoring up the European Union. The chancellor's prospective new coalition alliances may dictate a friendlier approach to some elements of plans for greater European unity. But she has less maneuvering room than she did previously, when her mandate was stronger.Alternative for Germany's now-proven vote-getting ability will probably make the chancellor extremely cautious when it comes to any agreements that will leave German taxpayers feeling they are footing the bill for the perceived irresponsibility of neighbors such as Greece or Italy. A likely coalition partner, the pro-business Free Democrats, is dead set against a key element of Macron's integration blueprint: a common budget for the 19-nation Eurozone.How powerful will Alternative for Germany be domestically?By the numbers alone -- AfD is forecast to be allotted 94 seats out of 709 in Parliament -- the party should wield considerable clout. But it won't be the leader of the opposition -- that role will probably fall to one of Merkel's erstwhile partners -- and no mainstream party is expected to ally with it. Longstanding infighting within the AfD burst into view the day after the vote, with one of its senior members, Frauke Petry, storming out of a news conference and announcing she would not be part of the party's parliamentary caucus.AfD's greatest influence, analysts say, may lie in continuing to move political discourse to the right, forcing others to adopt a milder version of some of its stances. Its rise, for example, is widely viewed as having forced Merkel to take steps to stem immigration, including a deal with Turkey, strongly denounced by human rights groups, to choke off refugee flows.The party has also shown signs of a penchant for harrying Merkel that has echoes of Trump's seeming obsession with Hillary Clinton. Although it didn't go to the lengths of leading ""Lock her up!"" chants at campaign rallies, one of the party's leaders, Alice Weidel, has threatened to look into ""breaches of the law"" by the chancellor.How did attitudes about World War II affect the vote?For decades, formalized atonement for Nazi atrocities has been a cornerstone of German public policy, a tenet challenged by some in the ranks of the AfD. That was symbolized on election night, when jubilant supporters of the party sang the national anthem, whose use is frowned upon in any sort of triumphalist political setting.Before the vote, Gauland shattered a taboo when he said Germany should be proud of its military's ""achievements"" in World War II. And an AfD leader in Thuringia state, Bjoern Hoecke, has urged a ""U-turn"" in how Germany's Nazi past is remembered.Many of its new lawmakers-to-be are unknown to the public, and analysts say they will probably include many extremist sympathizers.Said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, vice president of the German Marshall Fund: ""Not even their own party knows exactly who they are.""----------laura.king@latimes.com <CAPTION: Photo: Alexander Gauland, left, and Alice Weidel, leadership  members of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany, speak to  reporters Wednesday.

113,1874153741.xml,"Banksy's art fills Bethlehem hotel with world's 'worst view'BETHLEHEM, West Bank -- A Palestinian guesthouse packed with  artwork of the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy unveiled  itself Friday in Bethlehem, with a sneak peek of what the owner  sarcastically called the ""hotel with the worst view in the world.""Wisam Salsaa, 42, said the nine-room establishment named ""The  Walled Off Hotel"" will officially open March 11, but he offered  reporters a tour of the hotel looking at the West Bank separation  barrier erected by Israel to ward off potential Palestinian  attackers.The hotel, several of whose rooms look onto an Israeli security  watchtower, is awash in the trademark satirical work of the  mysterious artist. The highlight is room No. 3, known as ""Banksy's  Room,"" where guests sleep in a king-size bed underneath Banksy's  artwork showing a Palestinian and an Israeli in a pillow fight.The hotel also features a presidential suite and a museum with the  artist's politically-charged work. It has the markings of a  gentleman's club from the English colonial period. The entrance to  one small niche accommodates a life-size figure of Arthur James  Balfour signing his 1917 letter that came to be known as the  Balfour declaration, and was the basis for the international push  for the creation of Israel.The cheapest rooms are $30 a night.The project took 14 months to complete and was kept under secrecy,  in accordance with Banksy's request to protect his anonymity. His  artwork comments on war, child poverty and the environment. His  works have fetched as much as $1.8 million at auctions.Experts unearth mass grave at former orphanage in IrelandDUBLIN -- A mass grave containing the remains of babies and young  children has been discovered at a former Catholic orphanage in  Ireland, government-appointed investigators announced Friday in a  finding that offered the first conclusive proof following a  historian's efforts to trace the fates of nearly 800 children who  perished there.The commission said excavations since November at the site had  found an underground structure divided into 20 chambers containing  ""significant quantities of human remains.""The commission said DNA analysis confirmed the ages of the dead  ranged from 35 weeks to 3 years old and were buried chiefly in the  1950s, when the facility was one of over a dozen in Ireland  offering shelter to orphans, unwed mothers and their children.

It will be the first in-person meeting between  Trump and the German chancellor since the U.S. election in  November.Trump frequently criticized Merkel during his presidential  campaign, accusing her of ""ruining Germany"" by taking in large  numbers of refugees.Merkel, who wields significant sway in Europe, was critical of  Trump's refugee and immigration travel ban against seven  Muslim-majority nations -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria  and Yemen.The ban was blocked by the courts.Sanders did not offer details on what the two may discuss.Despite vow, Keystone pipe won't use U.S. steel after allPALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Keystone XL oil pipeline won't use American  steel in its construction, despite what President Donald Trump  says.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that's  due to language in a presidential directive Trump issued in  January. The directive applies to new pipelines or those under  repair. Sanders said it would be hard to do an about-face on  Keystone because it's already under construction.Trump said as recently as last week that Keystone and the Dakota  Access pipeline must use American steel ""or we're not building  one.""The Keystone pipeline would run from Canada to refineries in the  Gulf Coast. The Dakota Access line would move North Dakota oil to  Illinois, and that project is nearly complete.Reporter killed: Two attackers on a motorcycle gunned down Mexican  reporter Cecilio Pineda Birto in the southern state of Guerrero,  authorities said Friday, in what is considered one of the world's  most dangerous countries for journalists. Authorities said Pineda  was shot Thursday at a car wash in Ciudad Altamirano.WWII bomb: A British Army bomb disposal team was called in Friday  to dispose of a 500-pound bomb found buried on a building site in  northwest London. Schools, businesses and homes were evacuated and  roads closed as experts worked to make the German bomb safe. The  bomb was found Thursday. <CAPTION: Photo: A painting of an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian in a  pillow fight highlights ""Banksy's Room"" at a nine-room hotel in  Bethlehem, West Bank.

114,420669710.xml,"      German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has a message for Barack Obama: We can work it out. Merkel had signaled unease over a possible speech by the Democratic presidential candidate at Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate. A Merkel spokesman said Friday that while details had not yet been worked out, ""we are confident that we will reach a mutual and good solution which does justice to the interests of all involved."" Merkel had questioned the appropriateness of bringing a foreign election campaign to a  symbol of Germany's Cold War division and its reunification. Meanwhile, Obama's camp has refused to provide specifics on his planned trip. ---------- Page compiled from Tribune news services  ",2008-07-12
115,1904161585.xml,"Germans do not seem too friendly to Americans these days. According to a recent Harvard Kennedy School study of global media,  98 percent of German public television news portrays President  Donald Trump negatively, making it by far the most anti-Trump media  in the world.Yet the disdain predates the election of Trump, who is roundly  despised here for his unapologetic anti-European Union views.In a 2015 Pew Research Center survey of European countries, Germany  had the least favorable impression of America. Only about 50  percent of Germans expressed positive feelings toward former  President Barack Obama, who visited here last week to lecture the  world on diversity and tolerance but never changed negative  attitudes much from the unpopular George W. Bush years.Germans apparently do not appreciate that fellow NATO member  America still subsidizes their defense. Nor do they seem  appreciative of their huge trade surplus ($65 billion) with the  United States.Germans seem to have forgotten that American troops for 45 years  kept the Soviets from absorbing all of Germany. The Berlin Airlift  is now premodern history.Why, then, do confident Germans increasingly dislike the United  States?It is complicated.Since 1989, Germany has worked hard on its post-unification image  as a largely pacifistic country. It is eager to teach other nations  how to conduct themselves peacefully and to pursue shared global  goals such as reducing global warming or opening national borders  to the world's refugees.Implicit in Germany's utopian message is that postmodern Germans  know best what not to do -- given their terrible 20th century past,  with the aggressions of imperial Germany and later the savagery and  Holocaust perpetuated by Hitler's Third Reich.Yet being guilt-ridden does not equate to being humble (never a  German strong suit).The same conceit of an ethnically, linguistically and culturally  uniform state that drew Germany into conflict with the U.S. (whose  late entry into both World War I and World War II helped ensure  German defeats) has never quite disappeared.Instead, German condescension merely has been updated.In international finance, Germany de facto runs the European Union  on a mercantile system. It manipulates the euro as a weaker  currency to swarm export markets in a way that would have been  difficult with the older and higher-valued Deutsche mark.When poorer southern European countries bought too many German  goods on easy credit only to default on paying for them, the  Germans gave them informed but self-important lectures on their  need for Germanic thrift and industriousness.A similar German hubris was true of recent immigration into Europe.Berlin often virtue-signals the world how morally superior it now  is, while also searching for ways to import cheap labor. One result  is German Chancellor Angela Merkel's disastrous open-door policy of  welcoming in millions of unvetted immigrants from the war-ravaged  Middle East at a time of heightened worries over jihadist  terrorism.But Germany did not just flood its own country with impoverished,  hard-to-assimilate newcomers. It also dictated that other European  countries do the same -- whether they wished to or not.In matters of international relations and trade, Germany's sense of  superiority occasionally resulted in old-style cheating. To  increase imports of Volkswagens into the U.S., the company tried to  cheat emission tests to skirt expensive regulations. Germany's  Deutsche Bank was caught money-laundering the profits of Russians  in Vladimir Putin's crony cabal. And reports indicate that to  convince soccer's international governing body, FIFA, to award  Germany the 2006 World Cup, German officials resorted to bribery.Germans brag about their generous social welfare state and often  compare it to a supposedly cutthroat capitalist America. But  Germany is quieter about shirking its NATO membership requirements  for defense spending to free up cash for its own citizens -- and  making mega-profits from exporting pricey luxury cars to a  hyper-capitalist American elite.We should all feel gratitude to Germany for turning its undeniable  talent and energies from war to peace. Its huge economy  understandably makes Berlin influential in the European Union.Yet if German haughtiness works on a dependent Europe, it certainly  does not always impress a wary America.The United States is still far larger, wealthier and more powerful,  just as it was in 1918, 1945 and 1989. It does not necessarily  listen to German sanctimoniousness on climate change, immigration,  trade or the occasional need for the use of force.Instead, America more or less does what it believes to be in the  best interests of itself and its allies.Germans find such American independence cowboyish and insubordinate  -- and believe they can teach Americans about the dangers of such  misplaced chauvinism.Americans usually ignore these weary sermons. Instead, many of them  believe that whenever Germany sticks to worrying only about  Germany, the world is a far safer place -- both now and in the  past.----------Tribune Content AgencyVictor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover  Institution at Stanford University, and the author of the  forthcoming ""The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict  Was Fought and Won.""authorvdh@gmail.com <CREDIT: Victor Davis Hanson",2017-06-01
116,2429397087.xml,"Waiting for Dan Webb  This month, a one-year anniversary arrives on Aug. 23. On that date in 2019, prominent former U. S. Attorney Dan Webb was named special prosecutor to take a fresh looking at the handling of the infamous case of actor Jussie Smollett. The actor was charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct for allegedly faking a hate crime. Chicago police said the investigation cost more than $130,000. The charges were subsequently dropped by Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx not long after, according to news stories, she received a personal phone call from politically-connected attorney Tina Tchen on Smollett's behalf. News reports stated that Judge Michael Toomin appointed Webb as special prosecutor because Foxx ""inappropriately named her top deputy to take over after recusing herself"" from the case.Another important date is coming up: Nov. 3. On that day, local voters will decide if they want to reelect Kim Foxx as state's attorney. Wouldn't it be helpful to know whether or not she violated the people's faith in her by impropriety in the Smollett case? Webb will have less than three months from that one-year anniversary until the eve of the election to inform voters about Foxx.-- Christine Craven, Evergreen Park Defining democracyAs a social studies teacher in Chicago, the remarks on ""Democracy Under Siege"" by Mayor Lori Lightfoot provide not only teachers, students and parents with a teachable moment but an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the times we live in and to answer a few key questions about democracy and social activism examples we are we setting and want our youth to emulate.The reality is we do live in times of a pandemic where social unrest, protests, violence, social and economic hardships are fueled by hyper-partisanship, extreme divisiveness, disillusion with government and intolerance for basic humanity.As the mayor explains, ""Pain and righteous anger brought thousands into our city streets in a mass call for change."" Activism is urgent when a system is considered corrupt, inherently racist, lacking equity and justice. Here is where our democracy demands solutions.Yet, when people and members of society have little compassion for protesters getting their teeth knocked out or for the suffering of police officers sent to the emergency room, it sends a signal that something in our democracy is wrong. When our way of resolving society's troubles is tone deaf to listening to one another and rather blames and vilifies others that don't share our views, we have reached a point of pure hatred and loss of democratic values.So what is democracy?Perhaps its easier to explain what it is isn't. According to Lightfoot, democracy is flawed when driven by radical extreme thinking from the right or from the left that is unwilling to listen to anyone else. Similarly, democracy is not about who can scream the loudest. Democracy stops working when the people stop trusting their government. Lightfoot argues that people feel a sense of disaffection and disconnection, so they turn to other ways of solving their problems. Sadly, that is either through violence or by erasing any effort to listen or compromise on peaceful solutions. In 2020, democracy is also restricted in part by the enormous weight of social media and inability for people to engage directly and instead hide behind their devices.As teachers, parents and adults we should consider that it's not too late to return to democracy in which we are willing to listen, tolerate different viewpoints and learn to compromise, as opposed to blindly follow radical divisive extremes. We should promote nonviolent activism and engage directly with one another in a democratic process that underscores mutual respect and accountable government.Our children stand to benefit much more if our version of democracy prioritizes peaceful solutions instead of hostile attacks.-- Froy Jimenez, Chicago No 'if' on the electionWe talk about ""what if"" President Donald Trump will not accept the result of the election if he loses. There is no ""what if"" -- you simply pick him up under the arms and march him out the door.-- Susan Galvin, Roscoe The withdrawal from GermanyIn reference to President Trump's withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany, Deutsch Welle (German) television made the point that Russia has reemerged as a powerful threat to long-standing and emerging European democracies. Countries such as Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltics are extremely nervous, seeking more U.S. military support and rightly so.In the last few years, Russia has invaded and occupied Crimea, a large section of eastern Ukraine, 20% of Georgia, parts of Syria, and conducted continuous probing and incursions of Sweden and the Baltic countries.Add to this the many assassinations of Vladimir Putin's ""enemies"" residing on foreign soil. This is not the sleeping, benign Russia that emerged under Boris Yeltsin after the communist overthrow. Putin has shown he sees a reawakened Russia that should never have abandoned its former empire.With the return to Cold War tensions with European democracies, now is not the time to give this ""gift"" to Russia. In addition, Italy contributes much less to defense than Germany, yet the U.S. military is being bolstered there. It's apparent that Trump has a personal tiff with Angela Merkel, and being a hot tempered personality this is simply his retribution in foreign policy.-- Richard Fischer, Glen Ellyn Support the South Shore Drill TeamYour July 26 story on Chicago's largest cultural institutions confirms my suspicions that they will survive this pandemic. As a member of both the Art Institute and the Field Museum, I'm very grateful that their futures are secure.During this pandemic, we should also be concerned about the hundreds of smaller arts organizations that not only make Chicago a vibrant place to live, but also help address the challenges underserved neighborhoods face.South Shore Drill Team is just one example, and through my involvement I have firsthand knowledge of the many lives the group has saved over the past 40 years while entertaining millions of people across the country. With 36 events which would have brought in $80,000 in performance fees canceled, my sincere hope is that they, too, will continue for another 40 years and beyond.-- Sara Vlajcic, Geneva Support for animal protectionThe Animal Legal Defense Fund has commended Illinois for having the best animal protection laws in the country. This compassionate and humane accomplishment merits lauding. It's especially edifying because Illinois also has a strong record regarding human rights. Members of the Illinois House and Senate deserve credit for enacting these laws.

117,1916718906.xml,"The White House confirmed only on Tuesday that the most highly anticipated meeting of President Trump’s tenure - with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin - will take place Friday in Germany. But among advisors mindful of the many pitfalls, both domestic and global, preparations have been intense for some time.
The meeting of the two presidents, whose mutual admiration during the 2016 American presidential campaign stoked allegations of collusion that are now at the center of a criminal investigation in Washington, is certain to be a highlight of a summit of the world’s 20 wealthiest countries starting Thursday in Hamburg.
With issues of North Korea’s continued nuclear threats, Syria, Islamic State and global terrorism on the agenda - and Trump’s political future on leaders’ minds - the eyes of the world are trained toward the two men’s meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit.
“I worry a little about this meeting because Putin is going to walk into the room very well prepared, and I’m not certain Trump will come into that room prepared,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and career diplomat who now is a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.
Should Trump prove unprepared, that won’t be for lack of effort on the Americans’ side.
Leading up to his first face-to-face meeting with Putin, U.S. intelligence officials have prepared a detailed psychological profile of the long-serving Russian strongman, a former KGB officer who spent decades recruiting spies for the Soviet Union and mastered the art of bending people to his will.
The profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn’t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.
Yet senior aides have been mute on exactly what the two men will discuss. ""There's no specific agenda,"" Trump's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, told reporters. ""It's really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about.""
Trump should expect a strong backlash if he doesn’t tell Putin to keep out of future U.S. elections, warned the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), in a telephone interview.
""If he doesn't have the courage to raise the issue, Putin will conclude he can walk over our affairs and the president won't object,” Schiff said. “That would be a big mistake.”
Advisors including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James N. Mattis are trying to carefully script Trump’s interaction to head off any attempt by Putin to manipulate the encounter to his advantage, the U.S. officials said.
Putin is known to prepare assiduously for such high-stakes encounters with foreign counterparts, developing a command of policy objectives and honing a strategy to extract concessions, one U.S. official said.
“Putin was and is a KGB officer, and KGB officers are specialists at one thing: seduction, how to persuade others to do what you want,” said John Herbst, a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Council and a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush.
“The odds are the atmosphere will be good because our president seems to love Putin, even though it is bad policy,” Herbst said.
Herbst, who as a career foreign service officer helped prepare presidents and secretaries of State before such high-stakes interactions, suggested that Putin will try to establish a personal connection with Trump, who is widely seen among his global counterparts as particularly susceptible to flattery. And Putin will want to convince Trump that Russia is not a danger and NATO is “not as important” as Trump’s advisors say, Herbst said.
The White House said Tuesday that Trump and Putin will have a ""normal bilateral meeting"" Friday afternoon during the G-20 summit. That implies a longer, more formal meeting than the conversation he will have with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, as well as other ""pull aside"" meetings with the leaders of Mexico, Japan and several other countries that day.
Trump is also scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi Jinping at the gathering and is sure to keep pressing Xi to use China’s considerable influence over North Korea to get Pyongyang to cease its nuclear program. Trump could well raise North Korea with Putin too amid evidence that Russian firms have been selling arms and oil to the rogue state.
The session will be the first formal conversation between Putin and a U.S. president in nearly two years, since the Obama administration moved to isolate Moscow after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its interference elsewhere in Ukraine.
It comes amid tension over Moscow's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and its support for the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. A special counsel is directing an FBI investigation into whether people associated with Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to help Trump by hurting Hillary Clinton's chances of being elected.
Besides preparing Trump for the Putin dialogue, administration officials are seeking to bolster his leverage with Putin going into the talks. The president’s schedule calls for him to speak on Thursday in Warsaw and to meet with leaders of other Eastern European countries in an effort to highlight the U.S. commitment to stand with them to counter Russia’s efforts to regain influence there.
Trump will deliver his speech Thursday in front of a monument to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation. During the uprising, the Soviet army did not aid the Poles and many blamed Moscow for standing by as the Nazis crushed the rebellion and emptied the city.
Trump’s initial stop in Poland also suggests at least implicitly the continued significance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, contrary to his denigration of the alliance as “obsolete” while campaigning. Russian and European leaders will be watching closely to see whether he underscores the U.S. commitment to protect other NATO states under Article 5 of the alliance’s founding charter.
Defense Secretary Mattis called the U.S. obligation “ironclad” during a speech in Germany last week. But Trump’s failure to endorse it during a NATO conference in Brussels in May deeply unsettled allies, though he subsequently voiced support at a news conference in Washington.
Trump’s show of solidarity with Eastern Europe going into the meeting with Putin could complicate his stated desire to usher in a new era of good U.S.-Russian relations.
Putin is expected to look for ways to further undermine NATO and exploit divisions within, such as the tension between Trump and Merkel evident at the NATO summit and after Trump’s disavowal of the Paris accord on climate change. She told reporters in Germany that the G-20 meetings would be “thorny.”
Russian officials have also made overtures to the Trump administration about regaining two properties previously used by Russian intelligence services: a mansion on Long Island, N.Y., and a large house in Maryland. The Obama administration demanded the Russian government vacate both properties in December and kicked out 35 alleged spies in retaliation for Russian interference in the U.S. election.
Audiences in the U.S. and Russia will be watching closely to read any signs that one president got the better of the other, said Pifer, the former ambassador.
Seemingly small things could make a huge difference.
When Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak met with Trump in the Oval Office in May, only a photographer from the Russian state news agency Tass was allowed to take pictures. To the chagrin of the White House, which expected the photos would not be shared, the images were released and showed Trump and the two Russians smiling and apparently laughing together - a day after Trump had fired FBI Director James B. Comey out of frustration about the Russia investigation.
“My fear would be Putin comes out and says something that on the face of it looks like a pretty good deal,” Pifer said, “but when you look at the pieces, there are some hidden downsides that don’t appear until after the president has said yes.”

Bjoern Hoecke, one of the party's leading firebrands, has urged the country to take a ""180-degree turn"" away from mindfulness of its Nazi history. He called Berlin's famed Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe ""a memorial of disgrace."" Germany's history, he said, ""is made ugly and ridiculous.""Elena Roon, an AfD member from Bavaria and a candidate for parliament, recently posted a picture of Adolf Hitler on a WhatsApp chat with the headline ""Missing since 1945"" and a caption that read, ""Adolf, please respond! Germany needs you!""The Alternative for Germany party rose to prominence on its strident anti-refugee policies and its push for Germany to detach from the European Union's common currency, the euro. Those stances resonated deeply with a citizenry fed up with a bloated European Union and an open-door policy to waves of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.Running away from history, however, is a dangerous step backward for a nation whose postwar identity has been shaped by coming to grips with its dark and difficult past.Party leaders have had plenty of opportunity to cut the tether on Hoecke and Roon, whose remarks and actions have caused a good deal of discord. Despite all the hand-wringing going on in the AfD, Hoecke and Roon have not been ousted. That inaction is causing damage -- the party's poll numbers have been slipping, and Alternative for Germany is in danger of becoming a nonfactor in national elections slated for September.At a time when nationalism and insularity are on the rise around the globe, it is heartening to see so many Germans recoil from AfD. Countries with troubled chapters in their past heal and move forward when they resolve to learn from those chapters. To shove them aside is to remain mired in intolerance, paranoia and fear. Is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, which persecutes political opponents and chokes civil society, conveniently forgets the genocide committed under Josef Stalin and instead embraces the Soviet leader as a guardian of Russian order and national prestige?Every country needs to acknowledge every part of its history -- the bad with the good. And Germany's uncompromising postwar acceptance of its history represents an important part of its identity. Germany is Europe's leading economy, a democratic success story and one of America's strongest allies in the struggle against terrorism and an increasingly aggressive Russia. It's because of its dark past that Germany embraces multiculturalism and tolerance. Disavowing that history betrays Germany's identity today.CAPTION: Photo: Bjoern Hoecke, of the Alternative for Germany party, wants  Germany to end its efforts to atone for its Nazi history.

119,420169016.xml,"         Germans went to the polls last Sunday to chart their future and voted to, well, punt. Christian Democratic Union leader Angela Merkel, the eastern conservative who promised radical economic reforms, didn't win enough votes in parliament to govern alone. Neither did the current chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democrats, he of more modest reforms.    The result is a messy stalemate that will continue until various German parties cobble together some kind of coalition. Both Merkel and Schroeder are claiming the right to be chancellor. (Imagine the 2000 U.S. presidential election after Florida without a decisive U.S. Supreme Court ruling.) A resolution of this debacle may be possible only if both party leaders step aside.    Nobody knows how long it will take to clarify this mess. That means the economic changes Germany desperately needs won't come soon. Any coalition government will be forced to dilute (or ditch) bold initiatives to win support from minority parties with rival philosophies.    Which only delays Germany's reckoning with the future. This is disappointing--and not only for Germany. The lack of a clear vision in Berlin deepens the crisis facing the European Union, already reeling after France and the Netherlands spurned an EU constitution. It also deprives the U.S. of the hope that a revitalized Germany will soon help power the world economy.    Germany is the world's third largest economy and, as such, should be a robust engine in the center of Europe. But it is sagging under the weight of sluggish growth, a soaring budget deficit, unaffordably generous social benefits, high unemployment and an aging population. It is a toxic brew that worsens with time.    The German vote reflects a society much more fearful than hopeful about what lies ahead for the nation. This unease mirrors a similar anxiety about the future that, in part, caused the Dutch and French to rebuke their leaders and turn their backs on the proposed constitution.    These European nations have grown prosperous on a formula that no longer computes in a 21st Century world rapidly integrating China, India and all those hungry countries formerly pinned down by communism. Germany and the other mature Euro nations must adapt to this newly competitive world. That new world is not going away. Germany needs an economy that's more flexible and market-driven, one that promises less in benefits but more in opportunities.    Germans know this; they're just not ready to go there yet. But while Germany drifts, the world keeps spinning. Other nations, bursting with hope, are gaining. The gulf between fear and hope may seem unbridgeable after this election. But Germans will bridge it. They have no choice.  ",2005-09-25
120,420636684.xml,"      In a day of high drama in the normally sedate chamber of the UN General Assembly, President Bush and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used the same podium to point fingers at each other Tuesday and advance their own views of the future of the international body. While Bush cited the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in saying the United Nations should join him in a ""mission of liberation,"" Ahmadinejad scoffed at the efficacy of the UN Security Council and declared  that ""the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed."" Bush, whose administration has been pushing for a new Security Council resolution for sanctions against Iran, did not speak directly about those efforts. He chose instead to announce new sanctions against the regime of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, saying that Americans are ""outraged"" by the ruling military junta's ""19-year reign of fear."" He said the regime denies basic freedoms, such as speech, assembly and worship, to its citizens. Those new sanctions include economic ones on the leaders of the military regime and they expand a visa ban for those responsible for human-rights violations and their family members. Bush also  identified Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Iran as ""brutal regimes"" that deny their people fundamental human rights, as well as mentioning repression in Cuba, Zimbabwe and Sudan. ""In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is nearing its end,"" Bush said. ""The Cuban people are ready for their freedom. And as that nation enters a period of transition, the United Nations must insist on free speech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and competitive elections."" Cuba's foreign minister walked out of the assembly in protest.  During his speech, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega attacked Bush for demanding Cuban elections and slammed the treatment of migrants by the U.S. and Europe. The White House later explained why Bush's speech contained little mention of Iran. ""The president wanted this speech to focus on many other issues that are facing the world -- issues that people in Sudan and Zimbabwe and Burma are ... dealing with, in which the United Nations could bring its force and its weight in order to help,"" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. Ahmadinejad used the UN platform to indirectly accuse the U.S. of human-rights violations. ""Unfortunately, human rights are being extensively violated by certain powers, especially by those who pretend to be their exclusive advocates. Setting up secret prisons, abducting persons, trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process, extensive tapping of telephone conversations, intercepting private mail, and frequent summons to police and security centers have become commonplace and prevalent,"" he said. Ahmadinejad has defied two Security Council resolutions demanding Iran suspend enrichment of uranium and imposing sanctions. He said the Security Council is ineffective because it has been co-opted by ""arrogant powers"" which ""repeatedly accused Iran and even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it."" Tehran has long insisted on its right to have a nuclear program, which it says is solely for nuclear energy. Ahmadinejad said he would comply with the monitoring of Iran's nuclear program through ""its appropriate legal path,"" the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency. The Iranian leader spoke just a few hours after French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned the assembly that allowing Iran to acquire nuclear weapons would be an ""unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned of ""disastrous consequences"" for Israel and the world if Iran acquires a nuclear bomb. ""The world does not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a nuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is not striving toward such a bomb."" Ahmadinejad remained during Bush's speech, but the U.S. delegation walked out when Ahmadinejad took the stage. ---------- bfang@tribune.com Caption: Photo (color): Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice huddles Tuesday with President Bush at a meeting of the UN Security Council.

121,2576788312.xml,"BERLIN -- The party that narrowly beat outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel's bloc pushed Monday for a quick agreement on a coalition government, but Europe's biggest economy could still be in for weeks of uncertainty after an election that failed to set a clear direction.  Olaf Scholz, the candidate of the center-left Social Democrats, called for Merkel's center-right Union bloc to go into opposition after its worst-ever result in a national election. Both parties finished with well under 30% of the vote, and that appeared to put the keys to power in the hands of two opposition parties -- raising questions over the stability of a future government.Armin Laschet, the Union's candidate, rejected the idea that the election gave any party a clear mandate and made clear he still hopes to lead a new government. But he sounded considerably less confident Monday than he did a day earlier, when he said his bloc would do ""everything we can"" to form one -- and some allies hinted at skepticism that would happen.Whoever becomes chancellor will lead Germany into a new era. During Merkel's 16 years in office, she was seen abroad not just as Germany's leader but in many ways as Europe's, helping steer the European Union through a series of financial and political crises and ensuring her country maintained a high profile on the international stage.The unclear result, combined with the French presidential election in April, creates uncertainty -- at least for now -- in the two economic and political powers at the center of the EU, just as the bloc struggles with how to counter Russia and China, revamp its relationship with the United States and address questions about its future from populist leaders in eastern countries.Scholz, the current finance minister and vice chancellor, pulled his party out of a long poll slump to win on Sunday. Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, stumbled in a campaign that was strewn with missteps.But the kingmakers are likely to be the two prospective junior partners in any coalition, the environmentalist Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats. The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither ruled out going the other way.Merkel's outgoing government will remain in office until a successor is sworn in, a process that can take weeks or even months.Greyhound settles suit: Greyhound Lines Inc. will pay $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit over the bus line's practice of allowing U.S. Customs & Border Protection agents to board its buses in Washington state to conduct warrantless immigration sweeps, the state attorney general said Monday.The bus company failed to warn customers of the sweeps, misrepresented its role in allowing the sweeps to occur and subjected its passengers to discrimination based on skin color or national origin, Attorney General Bob Ferguson said.The lawsuit was filed in April 2020, alleging that Greyhound allowed the sweeps aboard its buses since at least 2013. Greyhound publicly acknowledged the practice in 2018.Texas redistricting: Texas Republicans proposed redrawn congressional maps Monday that would shore up their slipping dominance and bolster their nearly two dozen U.S. House members, while adding new districts in booming Austin and Houston.Texas was the big winner in the 2020 Census, as torrid growth fueled by nearly 2 million new Hispanic residents made it the only state awarded two additional congressional seats, bringing its total to 38.Republicans currently have 23 House seats in Texas, while Democrats have 13.The maps are the product of Texas Republicans wielding a newly freer hand to reengineer political boundaries: For the first time in more than 50 years, Texas is starting the redistricting process without federal oversight. A Supreme Court ruling in 2013 removed mandatory federal approval of new maps for Texas and all or parts of 15 other states with a history of discrimination in voting.Prize for opposition leader: The Council of Europe on Monday awarded its major human rights prize to jailed Belarus opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova, who was arrested last year after she tore up her passport at the border to prevent her forced expulsion from the country.This month, a court in Minsk found her guilty of conspiring to seize power, creating an extremist organization and of calling for actions damaging state security and sentenced her to 11 years in prison.At a ceremony in Strasbourg, France, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe awarded Kolesnikova, 39, its ninth Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize, which honors outstanding civil society action in the defense of human rights. The award is worth $70,160.Belarus was rocked by months of protests after President Alexander Lukashenko was awarded a sixth term in 2020.Biden aide, MBS to meet: President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the U.S. presses for a cease-fire in the yearslong war between the kingdom and Houthi rebels in Yemen.Sullivan will be the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit Saudi Arabia. Besides seeing the crown prince, often referred to as MBS, Sullivan is expected to meet with deputy defense minster Khalid bin Salman, a brother to the crown prince, according to two senior administration officials. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Biden White House has largely steered clear of the crown prince since making public in February a CIA report that showed MBS likely approved the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.Macron pelted by egg: French President Emmanuel Macron was hit on the shoulder Monday by an egg thrown at him by a 19-year-old student during a visit to an international food trade fair in Lyon, France.A video of the incident, widely shared on the social media, shows Macron walking through the crowd when an egg bounces off of him without breaking. Two bodyguards can be seen immediately getting closer to the president, and a man was taken away from the scene by other bodyguards.Reporters heard Macron saying ""If he has something to tell me, then he can come.""Lyon prosecutors said the student who threw the egg was immediately detained by police.CAPTION: Photo: A new challenge to India leader Modi: A farmer, center, blocks traffic Monday outside New Delhi.

122,2571562995.xml,"The federal prosecutor's office in Germany said Friday it was investigating who was responsible for a spate of hacking attempts aimed at lawmakers, amid growing concerns that Russia is trying to disrupt the Sept. 26 vote for a new government. The move by the prosecutor's office comes after Germany's Foreign Ministry said this week that it had protested to Russia, complaining that several state lawmakers and members of the federal parliament had been targeted by phishing emails and other attempts to obtain passwords and other personal information.Those accusations prompted the federal prosecutor to open a preliminary investigation against what was described as a ""foreign power.""The prosecutors did not identify the country but did cite the Foreign Ministry statement, leaving little doubt that their efforts were concentrated on Russia.In their statement, the prosecutors said they had opened an investigation ""in connection with the so-called Ghostwriter campaign,"" a reference to a hacking campaign that German intelligence says can be attributed to the Russian state and specifically to the Russian military intelligence service known as the GRU.Russia was found to have hacked into the German parliament's computer systems in 2015, and three years later it breached the German government's main data network.Chancellor Angela Merkel protested over both attacks, but her government struggled to find an appropriate response, and the matter of Russian hacking is now especially sensitive, coming in the weeks before Germans go to the polls to select a successor after her nearly 16 years in power.Moscow denied it was involved in the hacking efforts.""Despite our repeated appeals through diplomatic channels, our partners in Germany have not provided any evidence of Russia's involvement in these attacks,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said at a briefing Thursday.She called the German allegations ""an extraordinary PR story,"" and said the suspicions appeared to be the work of ""individual politicians"" intent on showing they would ""not allow gaps in trans-Atlantic solidarity,"" in an apparent reference to Germany's strong ties with the United States.Merkel is not running for reelection and will leave office after a new government is formed, meaning the election will be crucial in determining Germany's future -- and shaping its relationship with Russia.CREDIT: By Melissa Eddy, The New York Times",2021-09-12
123,1838679503.xml,"       President Barack Obama on Monday heads for Europe and then South America to face world leaders wondering what to expect from the U.S. after he leaves office, and to deliver the only honest answer he has: He just doesn't know. Aides to the president have spent the last few days wrestling with what to say about President-elect Donald Trump on the global stage. A private one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office a few days ago between Trump and Obama did little to shed light.   As a result, Obama is planning simply to note Trump's public commitment to work with him on a peaceful transfer of power, and to point to the historical precedent of U.S. presidents honoring long-standing alliances   ""Presidents in both parties have been committed to investing in those alliances,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""That's certainly what has happened in the past.""   Obama had hoped to be more specific when he first planned this trip months ago. Harboring a deep concern about the uncertain future of Europe, thrust into its own incendiary mix of a rise of nationalism amid an influx of millions of refugees, he wanted to use his final official foreign trip to reassure European allies and pledge support for shared policies.   At the time, he believed that Democrat Hillary Clinton would be elected to succeed him in the White House and that he'd be endorsing her plans to remain on the same foreign policy track after a long and divisive presidential campaign.   Trump's election changed all that. The Republican president-elect has offered few details of his plans for dealing with the rest of the world even as he cast himself as an opponent of existing trade agreements, the Iran nuclear deal and much of Obama's military strategy. He has said he prefers to keep adversaries guessing.   Of particular concern to the leaders of NATO-allied countries, many of whom Obama will meet with this week, is Trump's profession of admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The allies are at odds with Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, aggression in the Baltics and military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad in the years-long civil war there.   ""This trip was really meant to say, 'You know, we went through it, but we're going to be fine,' "" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Now the president has the unenviable task of explaining.""   European leaders fear ""the Trump effect,"" she said, and ""are very worried because the same populist, nationalist expressions, whether that's on immigration, whether that is on free trade, has certainly been running very strong political currents within Europe.""   Obama doesn't want to explain or speculate about Trump's plans, one senior aide said. Nor does he want to speak disrespectfully of the president-elect in private meetings with world leaders who may be trying to figure out how to deal with or even manipulate the new head of state. At the same time, Obama wants to be frank about the concerns and aspirations of Americans who elected Trump.   The high-wire act begins Monday as Obama leaves for Athens, Greece, where he'll discuss the NATO alliance and Greece's economic recovery with the country's leaders. He'll also visit the Parthenon, the ancient symbol of democracy and Western civilization, and deliver a major speech on how the world has changed while he has been in office.   On Thursday he'll fly to Berlin to pay one final visit to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he considers his closest partner over the course of his presidency. On Friday he will take part in a broader meeting that also includes the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain.   Some see the election of Trump as heightening the importance of Merkel, on whom the U.S. has relied heavily to help manage the crisis in Ukraine and Europe's economic future.   Obama will weigh in with a much larger group of world leaders after flying to Peru on Friday for a summit of the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. Obama will publicly confront the likelihood that the U.S. will back out of the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal he spent years pushing. Trump made clear on the campaign trail that he is against it.   Obama also may have to acknowledge to all of them, particularly Chinese President Xi Jinping, that the Trump-led government may not live up to the obligations of the global climate deal he pushed and that Obama and Xi jump-started with their own agreement two years ago.   And the South Korean and Japanese delegation will surely want to talk about Trump's suggestions during the campaign that it might be a good idea for their countries to obtain nuclear weapons.   Trump's nuclear policy remains elusive. He denied Sunday that he had recommended Japan or South Korea arm themselves with nuclear weapons, though he said so in a forum in March concerning how to counter North Korea's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.   ----------  christi.parsons@latimes.com Credit: By Christi Parsons and Michael A.

124,1663826325.xml,"       After a souring in relations between Germany and Greece over what Athens should do in exchange for rescue loans, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has accepted an invitation to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin next week, his office said Monday. It will be his first visit since his election. Germany is a major contributor to Greece's bailout and has insisted that it stick to budget austerity measures for more rescue loans.   Figures released Monday by the Greek central bank suggested the country needs the money. They showed the central government's cash balance was 684 million euros ($723 million) in deficit for the first two months of the year, compared with a surplus of 139 million euros in the same period of 2014. Excluding interest payments, the surplus fell to 503 million euros from 1.68 billion euros a year ago.   Tsipras' Syriza party came to power on a pledge to lighten the country's rescue loans. Tsipras' government has convinced creditors to give it a four-month extension on the bailout program, but to get the money it must still detail a list of reforms by the end of April. Greece on Monday repaid a loan worth about $615 million to the International Monetary Fund, a finance ministry official said.  ",2015-03-17
125,1898618919.xml,"France's new president vows to fortify EU, revamp politics PARIS -- In ceremonies marked by youthful optimism and old-world Napoleonic pomp, Emmanuel Macron swept into office Sunday as France's new president pledging to fortify the European Union, redesign French politics and glue together his divided nation.Macron's presidency began with a visit to troops wounded in overseas combat -- a reminder of France's large global military presence and role in fighting extremists from Syria to Africa.He's expected to name a prime minister imminently and to show his commitment to reviving European unity. Macron takes his first presidential trip Monday to Berlin to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel.In an inaugural speech, Macron vowed to lift France out of its sense of decline and seize again its place in the world.""The time has come for France to rise up to the occasion. The division and fractures across our society must be overcome because the world expects us to be strong, solid, clairvoyant.""He promised to take France's responsibilities to tackle today's crises -- ""the migration crisis, the climate challenge, authoritarian abuse, the excesses of capitalism in the world and of course terrorism. Nothing now strikes one and spares the other. We are all interdependent. We are all neighbors.""The 39-year-old Macron is the youngest president in the country's history and the eighth president of France's Fifth Republic, which was created in 1958. A former economy minister with pro-business, pro-European views, Macron is the first French president from outside the country's two mainstream parties. Evacuations of rebels from last Damascus stronghold beginsBEIRUT -- Hundreds of rebels and their families began leaving a northeastern neighborhood of Damascus and heading toward rebel-held areas in northern Syria on Sunday, in another step that would eventually bring all parts of the capital under the control of President Bashar Assad's forces, state media and opposition activists said.The evacuations came a day after government forces and their allies captured most of the area from insurgents who had maintained a presence in the northeastern neighborhood for four years.Last week, hundreds of opposition fighters were evacuated from two nearby neighborhoods.Government forces have been on the offensive for months in Damascus, and after they take control of the three neighborhoods, the capital will be fully clear of rebels for the first time since 2012. Thousands march against Moscow's demolition plansMOSCOW -- Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Moscow on Sunday to rally against a bill to tear down Soviet-era low-rise apartment buildings.Protesters, mostly young and middle-aged couples, gathered on a central street to rally against arguably Russia's largest redevelopment project to pull down entire neighborhoods of Soviet-era prefabricated blocks that were built under former leader Nikita Khrushchev.City Hall has insisted the buildings are too dilapidated and outdated, while many residents see the plans as a ruse to make way for high-rises in some of Moscow's leafiest neighborhoods.A bill on the demolition would force the residents to vacate their apartments in exchange for other housing. Ruling Fatah party fares poorly in Palestinian city electionsRAMALLAH, West Bank -- President Mahmoud Abbas's ruling Fatah Party posted a poor showing in Palestinian municipal elections across the West Bank, even though the rival Islamic Hamas movement stayed out of the race, according to results announced Sunday.The vote reflected public discontent with Abbas and his Fatah movement, whose popularity has sunk due to a weak economy, nepotism in its ranks and its failure to lead the Palestinians closer to independence.Saturday's vote gave Palestinians a rare chance to cast ballots after over a decade without presidential or legislative elections.In Hebron, the West Bank's largest city and a Hamas stronghold, Fatah won just seven of 15 seats. In Nablus, another major city, Fatah won 11 of 15 seats. Merkel's party wins vote in rivals' base in GermanyBERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives won a state election Sunday in their center-left rivals' traditional heartland, a stinging blow to the German leader's challenger in September's national vote.The western state of North Rhine-Westphalia is Germany's most populous and has been led by the center-left Social Democrats for all but five years since 1966.It is also the home state of Martin Schulz, the Social Democratic challenger seeking to deny Merkel a fourth term in the Sept. 24 national election.Media projections based on partial counting showed Merkel's Christian Democratic Union beating the Social Democrats by 33 percent to around 31 percent.They gave the Greens, the junior coalition partners in the state government, only 6 percent. Report: Police probing Israeli PM to query casino mogulJERUSALEM -- American casino mogul Sheldon Adelson will reportedly give Israeli police testimony in an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel's Channel 2 reported Sunday that Adelson, a close confidante of Netanyahu, and his wife will be questioned during a visit to Israel next week.The Adelsons will be questioned about allegations that Netanyahu tried to trade better coverage in a major Israeli newspaper in exchange for reduced circulation of a free daily paper owned by Adelson.According to the report, Adelson agreed to talk to police only when they told him he wasn't suspected of criminal activity.The investigation is one of several into alleged wrongdoing by Netanyahu.

126,1014289629.xml,"      Whether Greece exits the euro -- potentially triggering global  economic turmoil in the process -- depends on the tough choices of  Ivi Moreti and her 11 million countrymen. Should the 60-year-old widow leave her nest egg of euros in a  wobbly Greek bank and risk it being seized and converted into a  devalued national currency? Or should she withdraw it all, joining  what could become a herd of panic forcing Greece out of euro anyway  by bringing down the financial system?  Whom should she vote for June 17, when this nation mired in  political chaos holds it second election in two months?  A party willing to largely accept the crippling bailout conditions  that have taken a bite out of her pension and run the economy into  the ground? Or the rising rebels promising to buck the austerity  imposed on Greece by its bigger neighbors, a course that might  cause total economic collapse?  For Greece -- and Europe -- the decisions have never mattered more.  ""We are just a small nation,"" Moreti said, ruminating at a cafe  overlooking the Saronic Gulf. ""But if we go down, this is going to  be bad for everyone.""  Nations have left currency unions before. Ireland, for instance,  ditched its ties to the British pound on the road to 20th-century  independence. But if Greece is forced to exit the euro, global  markets could be thrust into uncharted economic territory for  modern times, and leaders of the G-8 are expected to address the  likely fallout Saturday at the summit hosted by President Barack  Obama at Camp David.  The damage would start with the likes of Moreti's wallet.  Moreti, who like many in Greece is terrified of losing the  stability of the euro, would almost surely watch as a new Greek  currency precipitously devalued, while interest rates and inflation  soared.  Economic paralysis, many argue, might create a pseudo-failed state  on Europe's strategically vital southeastern frontier from which  more and more illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Asia  could stream into the European Union.  At the same time, Europe could confront a broader threat, with the  chink in the euro's armor undermining reassurances from European  leaders that bigger troubled economies such as Spain and Italy  would not be the next to exit.  Greece's woes have been a train wreck 21/2 years in coming, giving  Europe time to prepare. But there are increasing signs that a  rupture in the euro will prove devastating. Panicked investors this  week, for instance, began massively dumping shares of Bankia,  Spain's second-largest bank by domestic deposits, amid fears of a  run on deposits.  Disruptions probably would not be confined to Europe.  U.S. companies that do business with the globe's biggest trading  bloc would nervously watch as traders sort out new values for the  euro and a separate Greek currency, as well as for countries from  Morocco to Lithuania that peg the value of their national notes to  the euro. Already, from London to New York to Tokyo, banks,  currency traders and travel agencies are hedging their bets ahead  of a potential Greek exit.  The looming possibility even has its own buzzword, ""Grexit.""  Yet much of what happens next is in the hands of the Greeks.  Greece's woes are a legacy of the 2000s credit bubble, when just  like American subprime mortgage borrowers, this nation was lent too  much cheap cash. It spent it poorly, lied about its economic data  and fell into a spiraling debt crisis. Though the 16 other members  of the euro bailed it out, the rescue came with demands of  austerity that have plunged this Mediterranean nation into a brutal  multiyear recession, triggering rising unemployment, homelessness  and a mounting health care crisis.  The impact has been so severe that even German Chancellor Angela  Merkel -- Europe's top fiscal disciplinarian -- has opened the door  to ""stimulus"" in Greece, in an apparent attempt to woo back voters  threatening to usher in a government that could break the terms of  the bailout deal completely.  The eurozone ""either has to make up or it is looking at a potential  breakup,"" Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron bluntly said last  week.  The mechanics of a currency switch would be chaotic if technically  simple, with a return to the drachma or a new national coin of any  other name potentially taking the early shape of government or  bank-issued IOUs. Greece, which now prints euros along with the  other nations that share the common currency, could within weeks  alter its presses to churn out national bills or outsource to  specialized companies abroad that, for instance, produced the new  dinar for Iraq.  Yet in Greece, an exit from the euro is still considered a  worst-case scenario, and one to be avoided at all costs.  Nikos Niakaros should be among those itching to see Greece ditch  the euro. An exporter of briny feta, he is well-positioned,  international economists say, to reap the benefits of a cheaper,  national currency. In theory it would boost his sales by making his  cheese more competitive in his major markets, Europe and the United  States.  But instead, Niakaros is sweating bullets.  Like many Greek exporters, he depends on a supply chain of imported  goods that would spike in price if Greece left the euro. Business  loans, meanwhile, would be far more expensive and harder to get.  Add unpredictable jumps in inflation as happened during the era of  the drachma, and, Niakaros said, the cost benefits of a cheaper  currency would disappear.  ""Those who think we will be better off without the euro do not know  Greece,"" Niakaros said.  Polls show that the vast majority in Greece wants to stay in the  euro, one of the few things they can count on in a country racked  by political and economic uncertainty. But they also feel pushed to  the breaking point by Europe's tough terms.  A poll released Friday suggested that Greek voters are shifting  back toward parties prepared to accept more fiscal pain in return  for staying in the eurozone.  ""We're all afraid, and that makes it harder for all of us,"" said  Moreti, the widow. ""But I think we must stay in the euro. We cannot  make it on our own.""

127,2350912135.xml,"Many women are acquainted with a certain type of boyfriend. He’s generous with gifts, meals and compliments. In public, he’s the picture of devotion. But when you need him, he’s not there. When you have a problem, it’s your fault. Eventually, you have to accept: He’s just not that into you.
For the U.S. military, Donald Trump is that kind of boyfriend. He claims to be their greatest champion. But by now it should be clear he doesn’t really love our men and women in uniform. He’s merely using them.
He’s even open to renting them out. He explained his deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia: “I said, ‘Listen, you’re a very rich country. You want more troops? I’m going to send them to you, but you have to pay us. They’re paying us. They’ve already deposited $1 billion in the bank.’”
The drone attack that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani was not really about protecting Americans. The Wall Street Journal reported that after the strike, Trump “told associates he was under pressure to deal with Gen. Soleimani from GOP senators he views as important supporters in his coming impeachment trial in the Senate.” Soldiers who survived a subsequent Iranian missile attack on their base in Iraq now know they could have died to help Trump survive impeachment.
His latest breach of faith is taking funds from our armed forces to build his border wall. The Washington Post reports that he intends to divert $7.2 billion this year. After he did the same thing last year, the Post noted, the Pentagon had to postpone or suspend an array of projects, “including road repairs, a waste treatment plant and school construction projects on military bases.” The children of soldiers bear the burden of the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.
When it comes to supporting our troops, Trump is reliably unreliable. It took him nearly three years to make his first visit to Afghanistan — something Barack Obama did three months into his first term. On Veterans Day 2018, Trump didn’t bother visiting Arlington National Cemetery, claiming he was “extremely busy on calls for the country.”
That no-show came after he skipped a ceremony in France honoring Americans killed in World War I. He blamed the rain, though French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel braved the elements to be there.
The signals of disrespect are big and small. During the campaign, Trump mocked John McCain’s credentials as a war hero and insulted a Gold Star family. He sent troops to the southern border just before the 2018 elections — which former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey called “a wasteful deployment of over-stretched soldiers and Marines.”
He offered a crass account of family members at Dover Air Force Base when the bodies of those killed in action are returned: “They’ll break through military barriers, they’ll run to the coffin and jump on the coffin. Crying mothers and wives, crying desperately.” Retired Adm. James Stavridis rebuked him for this violation of their privacy: “It’s inappropriate. That’s why we don’t have cameras in situations like that.”
Trump has no use for the rules that our service personnel have been trained to follow. He proved that in the case of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL commander court-martialed on charges of murder and attempted murder after being accused by members of his team, who called him “freaking evil” and a “psychopath.”
Gallagher was convicted only of posing with a corpse, but Trump pardoned him and extolled him as a hero. When the Navy moved to demote Gallagher, Trump intervened to protect him.
The president treats accomplished, battle-tested military leaders as if they were caddies at Trump National Doral. During the campaign, he boasted, “I know more about ISIS than the generals do.” After a SEAL was killed during a 2017 raid in Yemen, he blamed military leaders. “This was something they wanted to do,” he said. “And they lost (him).”
But when missions go well, Trump rushes to take credit. After the raid that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, he bragged: “I’ve been looking for him for three years.” The Delta Force commandos who risked their lives were turned into supporting players in Trump’s brassy theater of self-glorification.
They should not have been surprised. When Trump looks at the military, he’s not thinking: “What can I do for our troops?” He’s thinking, “What can our troops do for me?”

128,1941271787.xml,"Germany's national election Sunday has all the makings of a fait accompli. Chancellor Angela Merkel is on track to gain her fourth term, which would give her 16 years as Germany's leader. Martin Schulz, her closest rival and leader of the center-left Social Democrats, is behind in the latest polls by double digits. Merkel's camp can start chilling the Riesling.  In the meantime, Merkel can start thinking about the road ahead -- and it's fair to say it'll get bumpy.More than any other leader, the woman Germans affectionately call ""Mutti,"" or mother, runs the show in Europe. Germany is the European Union's heftiest, most vibrant economy, and with Britain Brexiting out of the EU, Merkel's pragmatic leadership has become the dominant voice on the European stage.But the rules of the game have changed in the eight months that Donald Trump has been president. Europe can no longer count on the White House the way it did in the pre-Trump era. Merkel publicly acknowledged as much last spring when she told Europeans to ""take our fate into our own hands. ... The times in which we could rely fully on others -- they are somewhat over.""Merkel said ""others,"" but she meant the U.S. Trump has upended trans-Atlantic relations, pushing positions that are antithetical to the EU agenda. He has said the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change, lauded Brexit, promoted protectionist policies and at times showed a vexing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin leader who digs deep into his toolbox for ways to create fissures in European unity.It doesn't help that Europe is more fractured and tenuous than it has been in decades. Great Britain's departure from the EU takes away the bloc's second largest economy and leaves it with just one nuclear power, France. To the east, nationalist-minded populist leaders in Poland and Hungary hold power. And the continent is still balancing the accommodation of Middle Eastern and North African refugees with the need to winnow out potential terrorists.Merkel's decision to allow as many as a million refugees, primarily from the Middle East, into the country in 2015 made her politically vulnerable, and her popularity dipped. But German officials have since sealed up a major conduit for refugees through the Balkans, and have reimposed border controls. ""People are not infused by that feeling any more that this is out of control, that we don't know what's going on and who's coming in,"" Germany's ambassador to the U.S., Peter Wittig, told the Tribune Editorial Board on Thursday. ""People now have the feeling that there is an orderly process. And Germans love order.""Another challenge for Merkel: Turkey has emerged as a major dilemma for Europe as a whole, and Germany in particular. The West recoiled at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's response to last year's failed coup. After the attempt, Erdogan oversaw a crackdown that jailed 50,000 people and suspended 150,000 from their jobs.Relations between Germany and Turkey became even more strained last spring, when Erdogan accused German officials of behaving like Nazis after Berlin kept him from campaigning in Germany's Turkish enclaves ahead of a referendum effectively broadening his presidential powers. Erdogan has since dubbed Merkel's team ""enemies of Turkey."" A NATO member, Turkey also has been edging closer to the Kremlin; it recently bought a surface-to-air missile system from Russia, rankling NATO leaders who see Russia as an aggressive adversary.Domestically, Merkel likely will have to cope with the emergence of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, which is expected to garner enough votes in Sunday's elections to gain several seats in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament.In Germany, voters pick a party, not a leader. It's a party's performance in the election that decides how many seats it gets in parliament, and who the country's leader will be. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, leads the pack. AfD is fiercely anti-immigration and anti-EU, and at one point during the campaign called for an end to atonement for Germany's Nazi past. It won't have enough votes to block Merkel's agenda, but polls suggest it may get enough support to become the third largest force in parliament.Americans will be watching keenly how Merkel navigates these shoals, mostly because a strong, united Europe is in America's best interests. A unified Europe is better fit to tackle terrorism, trade, financial crises, energy policy, immigration and, yes, Russia. We know who wants a weak, fragmented Europe -- the shirtless ex-KGB agent to the east.",2017-09-22
129,2445274337.xml,"QAnon is a sprawling internet conspiracy theory as ugly as it is unfathomable. It weaves together anti-government fever dreams into an absurd narrative that portrays President Donald Trump as waging a secret battle against Satan-worshiping pedophiles who run a global child sex-trafficking ring. Allegedly Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and the Dalai Lama may somehow be in on it. (They're not.) The QAnon theory centers in part on the discredited notion that there is a ""deep state"" anti-Trump cabal within the U.S. government. QAnon has links to an earlier loony tale known as ""Pizzagate,"" which claimed a Washington, D.C., pizzeria was the headquarters of a sex trafficking ring involving Clinton. Pizzagate compelled a North Carolina man to fire a rifle inside the restaurant in a misguided attempt to free imprisoned children, so there is danger connected to these hoaxes.Ideally, Illinois voters could spend their lifetimes never hearing about this except that QAnon talk is spreading this election season, and two Chicago-area Republicans seeking U.S. House seats have promoted the movement on social media and declined to denounce it. Philanise White of Chicago, running against Rep. Bobby Rush in the 1st Congressional District, and Theresa Raborn of Midlothian, running against Rep. Robin Kelly in the 2nd Congressional District, both have promoted QAnon by tweeting a recognized QAnon slogan as a hashtag.National news reports have identified White and Raborn as two of as many as a dozen Republicans running for Congress who have associated themselves with QAnon. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is expected to win a U.S. House seat from Georgia, said that Q, the mythical leader of QAnon, is a ""patriot,"" according to NPR. She has called the theory ""something worth listening to and paying attention to.""Like Taylor Greene and others, Trump has not condemned QAnon, which helps fan its notoriety. ""I don't know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,"" Trump said last month.That's a heck of a friendly statement by a president on a ludicrous theory that says North Korea's Kim Jong-Un is a CIA puppet and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is Adolf Hitler's granddaughter (she's not).Philanise White in 2019 tweeted the QAnon slogan #WWG1WGA, which stands for ""Where we go one, we go all."" Since then she's been listed in news report, including by Axios and Forbes.com, as citing QAnon. Given the chance to renounce QAnon, she's opted against doing so. When we asked White's campaign if the candidate supports the QAnon conspiracy theory or welcomes QAnon support of her campaign, White's camp replied by email: ""Why the interest in Q and/or QAnon over Blacks supporting President Trump? Q/QAnon has never come up as a concern of the constituents.""Theresa Raborn tweeted a video of Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, in which Flynn recites the QAnon hashtag. Raborn said she retweeted the video because she comes from a military family and respects Flynn. She told The Washington Post she ""could not definitively debunk or definitively confirm"" the theory. When we asked Raborn if she supports QAnon, she had plenty to say, but nothing bad about its theories and adherents. ""I'm not just going to tell someone they are crazy or a conspiracy theorist until I know for certain, and I just don't have time to research it. The little bit I do know is there is Q and there's people that take those posts and are trying to decipher it like it's some coded thing. ... One tweet and all of a sudden I'm supposed to support it? I don't really support it and I'm not going to make fun of it.""White and Raborn must see some benefit in showing respect for QAnon. They secured their Republican nominations after running unopposed in primaries. The GOP in the Chicago area is so weak that it struggles to recruit and support viable candidates in many elections. That's how the Republican Party ended up in the embarrassing position of having Arthur Jones, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist, running for Congress in 2018 in the 3rd Congressional District. Republicans didn't realize who Jones was until it was too late to enlist another challenger. Jones ran again this year, but thankfully Mike Fricilone of Homer Glen, a worthy candidate, also entered the race and won. Fricilone will face Democrat Marie Newman in November.One Illinois Republican speaking out on QAnon is Rep. Adam Kinzinger. ""I think conspiracy theories are going to be the thing that destroys this country in the long term because they undermine faith in government,"" he told CNN last month. Kinzinger wants Republican leaders to repudiate QAnon: ""It's fake. Condemn it, please guys,"" he said.That's pretty simple political wisdom. It's deeply concerning that White and Raborn cannot decipher the truth about conspiracies and won't dissociate themselves from the movement.Voters: Don't send hoax-stokers to the halls of Congress.CAPTION: Photo: Candidates engaging with the QAnon conspiracy theory are running for seats in state legislatures this year, breathing oxygen into a once-obscure conspiracy movement.

130,1803049230.xml,"       A political era ended Monday -- unexpectedly and without an election -- as Prime Minister David Cameron said he will step down Wednesday in favor of Theresa May, a senior member of his Cabinet who will become Britain's second female leader. Cameron announced his resignation last month because he backed the losing side in the referendum on whether Britain would leave the European Union. So did May -- but infighting, bad timing and cold feet among leaders of the victorious ""leave"" campaign mean that she will have the task of leading a divided country out of the EU.    The latest chapter in the political turmoil spawned by the EU vote moved with breathtaking speed.    On Monday morning, there were two candidates to lead the governing Conservative Party. At noon, Andrea Leadsom stepped down, making May leader-in-waiting. By late afternoon, Cameron had announced that May would be moving into 10 Downing Street within 48 hours.    ""We will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,"" Cameron said in a brief statement outside the leader's official London residence.    Cameron, who has governed since May 2010, said he would offer his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday after attending a final session of Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The monarch will then invite May -- as leader of a party with a majority in Parliament -- to lead a new government.    Speaking outside Parliament surrounded by Conservative colleagues, May said she was ""honored and humbled"" to have been chosen as the party's new leader.    May campaigned tepidly to remain in the EU but sought to reassure those who voted ""leave"" that she would respect their decision. She said there would be no attempt to avoid a British exit from the bloc.    ""Brexit means Brexit, and we're going to make a success of it,"" she said, promising to deliver ""a strong, new positive vision for the future of our country.""    May's sudden victory came when Leadsom, the energy minister, stepped down from the Conservative leadership race after a weekend furor over comments in which she appeared to say being a mother gave her an advantage over May, who has no children.    Only a week after she announced she was running, Leadsom said she had concluded she lacked ""sufficient support"" among legislators to be leader. She said ""the interests of our country are best served by the immediate appointment of a strong and well-supported prime minister.""    Cameron's resignation announcement the day after the June 23 referendum triggered the Tory leadership race.    The most prominent contenders to replace him -- including ""leave"" campaign leaders Boris Johnson and Michael Gove -- withdrew or were eliminated from contention one by one amid allegations of treachery and scheming.    Conservative lawmakers narrowed the field from five contenders to just Leadsom and May. Some 150,000 party members were due to choose between them in the coming weeks, with the result to be announced in September.    But with Leadsom's withdrawal, the party announced that May would be the new leader ""with immediate effect.""    May, 59, is one of the most experienced ministers in Cameron's Cabinet, serving for six years in the notoriously difficult job of home secretary, akin to the interior minister's post in other countries.    She has a reputation for solid, unflashy competence and for prevailing over her rivals.    May will become the country's 76th prime minister but only the second woman to hold the job following Margaret Thatcher, who stepped down over a quarter-century ago.    Although May has been occasionally likened to Thatcher, she has lately been compared to a more contemporary leader: German Chancellor Angela Merkel.    Both May and Merkel were born in the 1950s, the daughters of church pastors. They both inhabit the center-right of European politics but are also known for a strong pragmatic streak. Both are also considered tough negotiators -- skills they'll be putting to use against one another as May seeks a divorce deal with her soon-to-be-former EU counterparts.    The key question now is when she triggers the start of those talks. She had earlier said she did not want to invoke Article 50 -- the never-before-used mechanism for exiting the EU -- until at least 2017.    Meanwhile, the Conservatives aren't the only ones thrown into turmoil by the referendum, which has also sparked a leadership struggle in the main opposition Labour Party.    Labour lawmaker Angela Eagle has launched an attempt to unseat party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a staunchly uncharismatic socialist who has a strong base of support among Labour members but little backing from the party's 229 lawmakers.

131,1437306261.xml,"       Here's a troubling indicator: U.S. consumer confidence is sagging just as European consumer confidence is surging. We're losing our swagger as Europe is getting its swagger back. After rising for most of the year, U.S. consumer confidence fell for the second consecutive month in September to a five-month low, according to a widely watched index from the University of Michigan. The Conference Board (a private research firm that produces another oft-cited index) and a recent survey conducted by CNBC found similar results. In the CNBC poll, 61 percent of Americans expressed a downbeat view on the current state of the economy, a 5-point increase from three months ago.  Americans are growing more worried that their personal income won't keep up with inflation, that higher interest rates will make economic growth sag, and that the Washington budget wars will lead to an economy-battering partial shutdown of the government.  Yet in Europe, the skies are clearing. Consumer confidence in the United Kingdom rose to the highest level in six years as real-estate prices bounced back and spending ticked up.  Why is this happening? In part, because Europe is emerging from darker times. While the U.S. came out of the Great Recession in 2009, much of Europe suffered through a double-dip recession. Economic crises in Greece, Ireland and other countries threatened to be contagious. That sent confidence reeling in the Old World.  Talk about role reversal. For some time, it seemed, U.S. hopes for a robust recovery were being held back by the risk created by the economic failures of Europe. Now it looks like the public perception here is that our problems are homegrown. The political firmament in Europe looks more solid, buoyed by this month's election success of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  The consumer confidence measures are important because they tend to signal if shoppers will buy and businesses will hire. Economists pay attention to confidence indicators not just for what they show about today, but for what they suggest about the future. A decline, as the U.S. has seen in the last couple of months, suggests that buyers and employers may hunker down in the months ahead.  Fair warning to the White House and Congress: People are paying attention. Your bitter and senseless political warring is giving them reason to worry. The decisions you make in the next few days on federal spending and the debt ceiling will have economic ramifications that ripple for months.  In other words, wake up.

132,1822612811.xml,"       These debates would be must-watch TV because they would be the most extreme contrast of personal, intellectual, and political styles in America's democratic history. Right brain versus left brain; gut versus any portion of the brain at all; impulse versus calculation; id versus superego; and of course man versus woman. ... The first debate will be a matter-meets-antimatter conjunction at a single point. Live sports, from the Olympics to the Kentucky Derby, differ from other TV programming and compel live viewership because no one knows beforehand how things will turn out. The same is true of live presidential debates, above all any including Donald Trump. ... Clinton is her party's nominee independent of anything that happened in the 10 Democratic debates and town halls, and with minimal effect from them on her financial, endorsement, and name-recognition advantages. Trump is his party's nominee largely because of the Republicans' 20-some debates, town halls, forums, and other live-television displays.  -- James Fallows, The Atlantic  The surge of populist right-wing parties in Europe has now damaged the standing of the continent's most important leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Worse, the rise of movements fueled by nationalistic and racist programs signals that a core ethos of the European-American alliance vital to global stability for seven decades is threatened by extremist politics on both sides of the Atlantic. ...  The enthusiastic wheeler-dealerism (Donald Trump) promises to establish with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a hero to France's Marine Le Pen and other European ultra-rightists who subscribe to notions of racial and national superiority -- will force politically volatile European nations to scramble to strike their own bargains with Russia.  Count on a European stampede toward Moscow -- and an even more precipitous swing to the nationalistic right in European politics -- if Trump is declared the winner here in November. That moment would also mark the final burial of that American ideal of internationalism that helped to make Europe a more prosperous and peaceful continent for the second half of the 20th century.  -- Jim Hoagland, The Washington Post  ",2016-09-24
133,1442363264.xml,"       Germans are still struggling to form a government, with the  latest attempt by Chancellor Angela Merkel to woo a new coalition  partner ending in failure Wednesday. Germany has now gone nearly a month without a proper government  since voters went to the polls Sept. 22. Merkel emerged triumphant  from the election with a mandate for a third term, but her  conservative bloc fell a handful of seats short of a majority in  the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.  Since then, Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, has  been engaged in delicate power-sharing talks with other parties.  After hours of negotiations Tuesday, the ecologically minded Green  Party announced early Wednesday that it had decided against  throwing in its lot with the CDU to form a new government.  Claudia Roth, a leading member of the Green Party, said the two  sides had ""discussed all the points from A to Z in depth"" but that  the gulf between them remained too wide. The parties disagree on  such issues as health care reform and tax hikes on the rich.  That leaves Merkel with little choice but to keep bargaining with  the party that finished in second place in the election, the  center-left Social Democratic Party. A new round of talks between  officials of the two parties is scheduled Thursday.  Although surveys show most Germans in favor of a ""grand coalition,""  bringing together the two big parties of the right and left, the  Social Democrats are leery of such an awkward marriage of  convenience.  The last time they entered into a coalition with Merkel, during her  first term as chancellor, they were given a drubbing at the polls  by voters who saw little to distinguish the SDP from its historic  archrival.  The Social Democrats are likely to demand major concessions, such  as support for a national minimum wage, from Merkel's conservatives  in return for joining her government.  Although Merkel enjoys high personal approval ratings from the  public, and her party won more seats in the Bundestag last month  than in 2009, her room for maneuvering is constrained because the  business-friendly Free Democrats, her former coalition partner,  were shut out of parliament.  That has made Merkel's party virtually the only conservative one  still standing and has forced her to seek a governing partner from  the left.  Negotiations are expected to continue for several more days --  possibly weeks -- despite deep anxiety in other European quarters  over German inaction at a time when the region's debt problems  remain a source of concern and its economic recovery fragile.  The effort to stitch together a grand coalition in 2005 took two  months.  In an embarrassing setback for Merkel, it emerged that the family  behind the BMW car company had given her party about $932,000 just  as her administration was lobbying other European countries to  block higher emissions standards for big cars.  At a meeting of European Union environment ministers Monday, German  officials managed to persuade fellow EU members to water down the  standards.  On Tuesday, the Bundestag revealed that the wealthy Quandt family,  which owns a controlling stake in BMW, had made the large donation  to the CDU last week.  Merkel's government denies any link between the money and its  lobbying of EU ministers. But Juergen Trittin, a senior Green Party  leader, blasted Merkel on Twitter, saying the Quandts had  successfully bought her environmental policy.  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempt to woo the Green  Party as a partner fell through Wednesday.

134,1840997368.xml,"       President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel  admonished President-elect Donald Trump to take seriously his new  responsibilities on the world stage -- staging an extraordinary  scene in which the outgoing president and the leader of the  country's most powerful European ally expressed concern over the  newly elected president's approach to the world. As Trump prepares to take over the White House, Obama has told  Merkel he is worried about whether his successor will stand up to  Russian President Vladimir Putin as tensions escalate between  Russia and the West.  Merkel has questions about what the new administration might mean  for economic and national security issues, the victims of the  Syria's civil war -- Trump has said he wants to keep its refugees  out of the U.S. -- and the fate of shared values like the rule of  law and human rights.  Together, their message was unmistakable: Too much is at stake for  Trump not to take office with serious intent and an understanding  of the consequences of his foreign policy.  ""He ran an unconventional campaign,"" Obama said Thursday alongside  Merkel. ""He now has to transition to governance.  ""What may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections  may be different from what will work in terms of unifying the  country,"" he said, adding that ""the extraordinary demands that are  placed on the United States ... that forces you to focus. And if  you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there  very long.""  Merkel expressed concern about the possibility that a new  administration might fail to stand up to Russian efforts to subvert  its neighbors.  ""For over 70 years we have been able to enjoy peace,"" she said. ""To  live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and  sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In  view of European history, the reverse would be the start of a very  bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the  bud.""  They say they hope for the best, that Trump's most outlandish  campaign trail utterances will fade as he moves on to new  responsibilities. But their warnings were aimed at a  president-elect who has taken a scattershot approach to foreign  affairs.  Obama ticked off a number of complicated problems -- Syria, Islamic  State, climate, refugees -- and repeatedly said that taking a  multinational approach was the only path toward a solution.  It was a stark contrast to Trump's campaign pledges to tighten U.S.  borders and to pull back on long-standing agreements like the NATO  alliance unless other countries pay their fair share.  His chief foreign policy concern, however, was how Trump would deal  with Russia. He blamed the nation for cyberattacks during the U.S.  election, and his administration has also called for an  investigation into Russia's bombardment of civilians in Syria,  where it has provided military assistance to President Bashar  Assad.  Moscow has said that the U.S. has failed to live up to its  agreement to fight terrorism in Syria.  ""My hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and  suggest that, you know, if we just cut some deals with Russia, even  if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms, or  even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term  problems in regions like Syria, that we just do whatever is  convenient,"" Obama said of Trump.  Of particular concern in Europe is Russian aggression in the  Baltics following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.  ""Our conflict with Russia is not just about Ukraine, but also about  preserving the international norms, treaties and laws that have  governed behaviors between states since the end of the World War  II,"" said Michael McFaul, political science professor at Stanford  University and Obama's former senior Russia adviser. ""To abandon  those principles would have long-term, negative implications for  international stability. Obama understands these high stakes.""  Merkel has told reporters that she would cooperate with Trump on  the basis of respect for the rule of law and human dignity.  ""We cannot stand alone,"" she said Thursday. ""... You cannot, when  you just stand on your own, achieve much even though you may be  economically strong,"" she said, saying that populists like Trump  are preaching ""unfriendly policies.""  With Trump's intentions unclear on several fronts, Obama's final  visit to Berlin offered him a moment to hand over leadership to  Merkel of the Western liberal world view.  A scientist who grew up in the former East Germany, Merkel is now  the world leader with the greatest affinity for Obama. She showered  him with praise for their ""very close, very intensive cooperation""  during his last trip abroad as president and came near to tears as  he all but endorsed her for a fourth term as German chancellor. She  has not said whether she'll run.  Her country is a leader on the continent already, having accepted  millions of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in recent years in  the biggest global humanitarian crisis since World War II and  before that, leading the austerity effort to fight the economic  crisis.  On Friday, Obama and Merkel plan to draw the leaders of France,  Britain, Spain and Italy into the conversation about the future of  Europe and their shared global agenda.  ---------- christi.parsons@latimes.com Credit: By Christi Parsons, Washington Bureau Caption: Photo: President Barack Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel stand  united Thursday in Berlin.

135,1916718809.xml,"On the eve of his first face-to-face talks in office with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump declined to hold the Kremlin solely responsible for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, saying others may have interfered as well.
At a news conference Thursday with his Polish counterpart in Warsaw, Trump also said he was considering some unspecified “pretty severe things” in response to North Korea’s firing of a ballistic missile capable of hitting parts of the United States. “Something will have to be done about it,” he told reporters.
Later, in a speech delivered in an iconic Warsaw square, Trump cast Islamic extremism as a modern-day successor to historic horrors like Nazism and Communist oppression.
“We must stand united against these shared enemies,” he said, his address repeatedly interrupted by raucous cheers and chants. “Our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.”
Portraying the struggle against terrorism as the West’s primary mission, the president cited “dire threats to our security and our way of life” that must be countered by “bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.”
Speaking against the backdrop of a memorial to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis, Trump praised Polish perseverance and sacrifice, asking: “Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?”
To NATO allies, Trump offered an explicit commitment to the alliance’s founding principle of common defense, which he had failed to state unambiguously at a May meeting in Brussels. But he also again tweaked allies who he said were not contributing enough financially, taking credit for “billions and billions” coming into NATO as a result of his importuning members to pay more.
Trump’s characterization of Russian election interference was considerably more tepid than U.S. intelligence assessments that the Kremlin directed a concerted campaign of cyber meddling meant to help him beat his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. In his comments, he repeated an assertion that “nobody really knows” who bore the ultimate responsibility.
“I think it was Russia, and it could have been other people in other countries,” he said. “I think a lot of people interfere.”
Even while leaving conditional the degree of interference by Moscow - “if Russia did it,” as he put it - Trump also renewed an attack against his predecessor, President Obama, saying he had failed to act on intelligence pointing to Russian interference that surfaced months before the election.
“That’s a lot of time, he did nothing about it,” said Trump, who was to meet Putin on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering in the German city of Hamburg.
On North Korea, the president declined to provide specifics about potential options under consideration to rein in the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
“I don’t like to talk about what we have planned,” he said, adding: “They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner.”
Trump was welcomed warmly by Polish President Andrzej Duda, a right-wing populist who has cracked down on immigration, the judiciary and freedom of the press.
The two leaders met privately at the national Royal Castle in Warsaw before giving public remarks and taking questions from the media.
“Mr. Trump is thinking very seriously about Poland’s security,” Duda told reporters, adding that he was convinced by his meeting with Trump that the U.S. is “our loyal ally.”
In advance of the American president’s speech in front of a memorial to Polish resistance to Nazi occupation, supporters of the ruling Law and Justice party lined the street outside a small but landmark square, holding banners and Polish and American flags.
A few people wore the bright red baseball hats from Trump's campaign with the words ""Make America Great Again"" written in white across the top. As a few lawmakers from opposition parties walked through security, chants in the crowd went up, calling them ""thief"" and ""traitor"" in Polish.
Trump’s visit to Poland marks a brief stop in an environment friendlier than the one that likely awaits him in Germany. Several European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have been sharply critical of Trump’s protectionist policies on trade and his decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.
Trump’s visit to Europe comes as he faces urgent foreign policy tests on multiple fronts. In addition to North Korea’s missile adding urgency to Trump’s calls for China to do more to pressure Kim to end his nuclear program, the fight against Islamic State in Syria has reached a critical point.
After the Warsaw stop, Trump will fly to Hamburg for a sit-down with Merkel on Thursday evening and a joint meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Like Trump, Duda was swept into power with a nationalist-populist message. He promised to protect Polish interests from international agreements and has set tight limits on immigration despite pressure from western European leaders to accept more refugees from war-torn countries like Syria.
Since being elected in 2015, Duda has launched a public campaign against the press and tried to undermine Polish media outlets. In the past year, Duda’s administration and his allies that control the legislature have restricted government access to reporters, a clampdown on press freedom that sparked large protests in Warsaw in December.

136,2068267172.xml,"President Donald Trump upended the show of unity at NATO's annual summit Wednesday as many allies had feared, claiming that Germany ""is totally controlled by"" and ""captive to Russia"" and inflating his demands that they spend more on defense to an unrealistic level. The president's comments in Brussels, especially his unexpected attack on Germany, Europe's leading power, undercut the alliance's ultimate declaration of shared values and a joint defense against Russian aggression.His attack on Germany as beholden to Russia, because of a pipeline project, was in keeping with Trump's practice of accusing others of behavior he has been accused of. It comes after he irked allies last month by suggesting that Russia should be readmitted to the Group of Seven alliance of industrialized nations.Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in Helsinki, a get-together that, given his frequent warm words for the autocrat, has U.S. allies apprehensive.Trump's posture toward close allies has been increasingly confrontational this year, especially in comparison to his more conciliatory approach to adversaries, including Russia and North Korea. Even as he flew to Brussels, Trump continued his attacks on NATO allies for not spending more on defense, and after hours of meetings Wednesday he reiterated his disdain in a tweet that began, ""What good is NATO ... ?""As his latest remarks filtered back to the United States, some Republican congressional leaders criticized the president for his slams against Germany and other allies, though others defended him.Among Democrats, former Secretary of State John Kerry called Trump's statements ""disgraceful, destructive,"" and the party's congressional leaders -- Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi -- in a joint statement said the president's comments were an ""embarrassment"" and ""another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies.""In closed-door summit meetings, Trump increased his previous demands for NATO allies' defense spending, saying each of the 29 member nations should budget an amount equal to 4 percent of their economies as measured by their gross domestic product -- up from 2 percent.While NATO in 2014 set the goal that each nation reach the 2 percent level by 2024, Trump told allies to do so immediately. Doubling that, which allies reject, would require the U.S. -- now at 3.5 percent of GDP -- to also increase its military spending.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who emphasized the steady increases in member nations' military spending in recent years, later told reporters that the alliance would focus on meeting its current goal.White House aides privately acknowledged that Trump's posture was intended to create leverage on trade and security issues.Though Trump had been expected to shake things up in Brussels, especially after he'd broken with allies last month at the G-7 summit in Canada, his performance still was something of a shock -- and one that drew widespread criticism.Nicholas Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador to NATO on Sept. 11, 2001, after which the alliance voted to come to the aid of the United States, said, ""Our big strategic advantage over Russia is we have these big alliance systems and they don't. That's a very big part of America's influence in the world and the president doesn't see that, because he's so narrowly focused on trade disputes.""""He's making a major mistake if he keeps this up,"" Burns added. ""It's taking on the vestiges of a vendetta. When you go out at the start of the summit and set a tone that looks so anti-German and looks like it's aimed at weakening (Chancellor Angela) Merkel, it looks malicious.""Following the meetings at the sprawling NATO campus on the outskirts of Belgium's capital, Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, took to Twitter for damage control.NATO, he tweeted, ""is the most successful alliance in history. All #NATO allies have committed to extending this success through increased defense spending, deterrence and defense, and fighting terrorism. Weakness provokes; strength and cohesion protects. This remains our bedrock belief.""Adding to the unease is anticipation of Trump's upcoming meeting with Putin. Amid speculation that Trump would acquiesce in Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, Stoltenberg dodged a reporter's question about whether the president had given any assurances that he would stand by NATO's position that the action was illegal.Critics say that while Trump has grounds to complain, as past presidents have, that NATO allies are taking advantage of the United States, he fails to recognize the alliance's value to the country."" 'America First' has been his mantra. What Trump doesn't understand is, the United States cannot defend itself without its assets and bases on foreign soil,"" said Frank Rose, a former official at the Defense and State departments in Republican and Democratic administrations.""That radar in Denmark is not there to defend the Danes. It is defending us,"" Rose continued.At a breakfast with Stoltenberg before the summit, Trump redirected a question about his looming meeting with Putin by suggesting that a natural gas pipeline project has made Germany subservient to Russia. He apparently was referring to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would dramatically increase the amount of gas Russia is able to export directly to Germany.""Germany is totally controlled by Russia,"" Trump said. ""You tell me if that's appropriate, because I think it's not.""Merkel delivered a public retort upon arriving at the summit. The chancellor, who grew up during the Cold War in the former East Germany, under the Soviet Union's control, said she didn't need to be lectured about dealing with authoritarian regimes.""I have experienced myself how a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union,"" she said. ""I am very happy that today we are united in freedom, the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions.""When the two leaders met privately later, they spoke about the pipeline as well as other issues, Trump said. But in their brief remarks to reporters, he only flattered Merkel about Germany's economic gains.French President Emmanuel Macron, asked by a reporter following his short meeting with Trump if he agreed that Germany is captive to Russia, said he did not, as Trump sat alongside him.As is often the case with Trump, his criticism of the pipeline project contains a measure of truth within his distortions and misrepresentations.Germany isn't ""captive"" because the pipeline isn't finished, though U.S. and Eastern European countries have long worried that Germany could become more dependent on it over time. Russia in the past has manipulated gas supplies to threaten Ukraine.Ukrainians, Poles and other Eastern Europeans worry that Western Europe could become less willing to protect them if Russia has a bigger role as an energy supplier.However, defenders of the pipeline have long argued that Russia, whose economy depends heavily on energy sales, will become less confrontational with the West if its prosperity becomes more intertwined with the rest of Europe.The pipeline has also been backed by German environmentalists because increased use of natural gas has allowed the country to phase out coal and reduce its dependence on nuclear power.""This pipeline, there are real questions about getting too dependent on Russia -- that's not an illegitimate question to ask,"" said Robert Jervis, a professor of international relations at Columbia University.""The problem is then he doesn't have the attention span to sit still for the discussion or contemplation of the question itself.""A commercial element could be at play in Trump's complaint: If Germany imported less gas from Russia, it might import liquefied natural gas from the U.S.Merkel has had her own criticisms of the pipeline, although she has not stopped it.The project was pushed by her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, who had warm relations with Putin and signed the deal in 2005, just days after Merkel's party beat him in German elections.Schroeder has gone on to have extensive business dealings with Russia.Even before Trump's morning blast, allied leaders were nervous about the American president's ambivalence toward NATO and his repeated demands that they increase their share of military spending.They weren't alone.On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 97-2 in favor of a resolution in support of NATO and the House did so unanimously Wednesday. ""NATO is indispensable,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that Trump ""can be a little too critical of the other counterparts, and I don't think he should be critical.""The president continued to hammer his complaints about NATO countries' military expenditures at the breakfast, stating that the situation is ""not fair"" to American taxpayers. ""But we will make it fair,"" he said.Trump singled out Germany for complaint, and Merkel, in her comments upon arriving, took issue with that criticism as well.""Germany does a lot for NATO,"" she said. ""Germany is the second largest provider of troops, the largest part of our military capacity is offered to NATO and until today we have a strong engagement towards Afghanistan. In that we also defend the interests of the United States.""Trump's repeated complaints have swayed some Americans against the alliance that has guarded the trans-Atlantic democratic order for nearly 70 years. Backing for NATO has declined among Trump's supporters, polls show.While Trump spoke again of NATO countries being delinquent and owing the United States, their defense spending has nothing to do with payments to NATO or the U.S. All NATO members are current on their actual contributions to the alliance.CAPTION: Photo: President Donald Trump seemed to go it alone in his  criticism of Germany at the two-day NATO summit Wednesday in  Brussels.

137,2355517154.xml,"DUBLIN -- Ireland braced for weeks of political uncertainty Monday 
after an earthshaking election that saw the Irish Republican 
Army-linked party Sinn Fein -- long shunned by its bigger rivals -- 
take the largest share of votes.In a surge that upended Ireland's traditional two-party system, the  left-wing nationalist party beat both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael,  the centrist parties that have governed Ireland since it won  independence from Britain a century ago.Sinn Fein, received 24.5% of the first-preference votes, besting  the two long-dominant parties. Fianna Fail received 22.2% of the  votes. Fine Gael, the party of incumbent Prime Minister Leo  Varadkar, got 20.9%.Sinn Fein's left-wing proposals for tackling Ireland's housing  crisis and creaking health care system proved a powerful draw for  young voters in a country that is still dealing with aftershocks of  the 2008 global financial crisis, which hammered its debt-driven  ""Celtic Tiger"" economy.Vote counting resumed Monday to fill all the seats in the 160-seat  Dail, the lower house of Ireland's parliament.With more than three-quarters of the seats in parliament filled,  Sinn Fein had taken 37, Fine Gael 29 and Fianna Fail 27.No party is likely to reach the 80 seats needed for a majority,  making some form of coalition inevitable. But forming a stable  alliance looks tough.Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael had said before Saturday's election  that they would not go into a coalition with Sinn Fein because of  its links to past violence. Interior Dept. drops trophy hunting panel amid court fightWASHINGTON -- Facing significant legal challenges, the Trump  administration has disbanded its advisory board created to help  boost trophy hunting and relax federal rules for importing the  heads and hides of African elephants, lions and rhinos.The International Wildlife Conservation Council was created by  then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former Republican congressman  from Montana forced to resign amid a corruption scandal.A 2018 investigation by The Associated Press showed that the board  was stuffed with big-game hunters, including appointees with direct  ties to President Donald Trump and his family.A coalition of environmental groups later sued, alleging that the  board's one-sided makeup violated the law governing the creation of  federal advisory boards.

The decision upended  Merkel's plan to hand Kramp-Karrenbauer the reins after more than  15 years as chancellor.The announcement followed days of party infighting over the  election of a governor in the state of Thuringia. CDU legislators  there defied Kramp-Karrenbauer's advance appeals and voted with the  far-right Alternative for Germany party to oust a left-wing  incumbent.

He  entered the pleas in federal court in Lafayette, and sentencing is  set for May 22.""Matthews admitted to setting the fires because of the religious  character of these buildings, in a self-promotional effort to raise  his profile as a 'Black Metal' musician by copying similar crimes  committed in Norway in the 1990s,"" the U.S. Attorney's statement  said.

The head of East Germany's Social Democratic Party quit his post amid allegations he had links to the Stasi secret police, his party announced Monday.


Ibrahim Boehme, who denies the allegations, said he was resigning because it will take ""lengthy investigations"" to clear up the accusations, said August Kamilli, a high-ranking Social Democrat.


East Germany has been thrown into a political crisis by charges that many of its politicians had links to Stasi, which the former Communist leaders used to control East Germany.


The accusations have overshadowed efforts by the conservative alliance that won East Germany's March 18 elections to put together a coalition government with the Social Democrats.


Boehme became the second top politician to leave his post because of allegations of Stasi links. Just before the elections, Wolfgang Schnur said he had ties to the Communists' secret police and resigned as head of Democratic Awakening, one of three parties in the Alliance for Germany, which won the March 18 elections.


Boehme announced his resignation in a letter dated Sunday, Kamilli said. He went to the former secret police headquarters in East Berlin Friday to look at formerly classified documents, aiming to clear his name.


But according to Kamilli, after viewing the records Boehme decided a ""speedy clarification"" was impossible and he wanted to avoid ""burdening the young democracy and the work of the party.""


Kamilli said a special party congress will convene to name Boehme's successor. Markus Merkel, the party's deputy chairman, took over in Boehme's absence.


Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the alliance and the East German Christian Democrats, has also been accused of having worked with the secret police, an allegation he denies.


Manfred Stople, administrator of East Berlin's Lutheran Church, last week examined secret police files kept on De Maiziere and later said he saw nothing to incriminate him.

139,419048211.xml,"      German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder criticized his own party Monday for suggesting that his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, could be jailed if he refuses to identify secret campaign donors. ""This debate is superfluous,"" Schroeder said, adding he expects Kohl to ""fulfill his citizen's duty"" and come forward with the names. Members of the governing Social Democrats threatened Kohl over the weekend with fines and even detention if he refused to reveal the donors in a parliamentary inquiry into whether payoffs influenced his government's policy. But Friedhelm Julius Beucher, a Social Democrat member of the panel investigating Kohl, said Monday that asking a judge to order ""coercive detention"" if Kohl remains stubborn was only theoretical. ""My colleagues were citing an option,"" he said on Hesse state radio. ""Obviously there's no threat of coercive detention."" Schroeder's remarks indicated he wants to keep away from partisan sniping in a scandal that is rocking German politics. Nonetheless, Kohl faced growing pressure from his own party, the Christian Democrats, to provide full details of secret cash contributions during his time as party chairman, which ended with his election defeat last year. The general secretary of the party, Angela Merkel, made her clearest plea yet for her former boss to provide the names. ""Much would be clearer if we knew more about the origin of these donations,"" she said on a Sunday night television show, without naming Kohl. Kohl said last week that he received as much as $1 million in covert contributions for his party between 1993 and 1998. He has denied that any of the money went into his personal accounts, saying the funds were used to help the party get a foothold in the former East Germany. The admission only intensified charges by fellow politicians that Kohl was acting above the law. Sabine Leutheusser Schnarrenberger, once Kohl's justice minister, voiced shock that he ""apparently has no sense that he's done something wrong."" ""Helmut Kohl is destroying himself in a breathtaking fashion,"" the Berliner Zeitung wrote, also calling for Kohl to resign from parliament. Kohl was interviewed Monday by auditors Ernst & Young, who have been hired by the new Christian Democrat leadership to look into the scandal. No details emerged from the interview. A party spokesman said Ernst & Young would brief Wolfgang Schaeuble, who took over as party leader from Kohl after the 1998 election defeat. Also Monday, Schroeder's spokesman confirmed that government files are missing on a major industrial project under scrutiny in parliament's investigation. The files relate to the privatization of the Leuna refinery and a service station network in the former East Germany after German unification. The refinery was sold to France's Elf Aquitaine in 1992. Allegations that payoffs were involved in the privatization have swirled for years, but an earlier parliamentary inquiry in Germany failed to pin down evidence. Beucher has said he believes some Leuna files from Kohl's chancellery were destroyed, a charge denied by Kohl's former chief of staff.  ",1999-12-21
140,1914112359.xml,"Colombia takes historic step to peace as rebels lay down guns MESETAS, Colombia -- Colombia reached a major milestone on its road to peace Tuesday as leftist rebels relinquished some of their last weapons and declared an end to their half-century insurgency.The historic step was taken as President Juan Manuel Santos traveled to this demobilization camp in Colombia's eastern jungles to join guerrilla leaders as they begin their transition to civilian life.In a short, symbol-filled ceremony, U.N. observers shut and padlocked the last containers storing some of the 7,132 weapons that members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have turned over during the past few weeks at 26 camps across the country. Yellow butterflies were released and an AK-47 converted into an electric guitar rang out plaintive chords in honor of the conflict's victims.Though hundreds of FARC caches filled with larger weapons and explosives are still being cleared, the U.N. on Monday certified that all individual firearms and weapons, except for a small number needed to safeguard the soon-to-disband camps, have been collected.The day put Colombia one step closer to turning a page on Latin America's longest-running conflict, which caused at least 250,000 deaths, left 60,000 people missing and displaced more than 7 million.After years of thorny negotiations, the rebels reached an agreement with the government last year to give up their weapons and transition into a political party. But implementing the accord has been slow.The initial deal was narrowly rejected in a national referendum, Congress has struggled to pass laws implementing the revised accord, and opposition lawmakers are threatening to overturn key aspects of the deal if they win the presidential election next year. House panel approves bill privatizing air traffic controlTRENTON, N.J. -- A House panel approved legislation Tuesday that would split off management of the nation's skies from the Federal Aviation Administration and give that responsibility to an independent, nonprofit company.The Republican-led committee approved the legislation by a vote of 32-25 with supporters saying it was critical to remove air traffic control from the vagaries of the government's budget process. Proponents say Washington dysfunction hampers the FAA's efforts to update equipment designed to make flying quicker and safer. The legislation would establish a company with a 13-member board of directors to provide air traffic services.The agency would still be responsible for regulating aviation safety, including the work of the new company. French leader invites Trumpto event to honor WWI troopsPARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron invited President Donald Trump to a Bastille Day celebration next month to celebrate the arrival 100 years ago of the American troops who fought alongside the French during World War I.An official of the presidential Elysee Palace said the invitation to Trump and first lady Melania Trump was extended Tuesday during a telephone conversation to prepare for the two leaders' meeting during the G-20 summit in Germany on July 7-8.France celebrates Bastille Day with a military parade down the Champs-Elysees every July 14. The official says the White House is examining the feasibility of a Paris visit. The official requested anonymity in keeping with presidential practice. Ross signals U.S., Europe should work out free trade agreementBERLIN -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday that the U.S. and the European Union should have a free trade agreement, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for work on such an accord to resume.President Donald Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from an agreement with nations around the Pacific, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but the fate of a proposed trade deal with the EU has been less clear. Merkel vowed recently not to give up on that accord, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Ross told a conference in Berlin attended by Merkel that the U.S. had made a ""conscious decision not to walk away from TTIP"" when it ditched the Pacific accord.Ross addressed the event by video link after canceling a trip to Berlin. Manafort files forms showing Ukraine paymentsA consulting firm led by Paul Manafort, who chaired Donald Trump's presidential campaign for several months last year, retroactively filed forms Tuesday showing that his firm received $17.1 million over two years from a political party that dominated Ukraine before its leader fled to Russia in 2014.Manafort disclosed the total payments his firm received between 2012 and 2014 in a filing late Tuesday that was submitted to the U.S. Justice Department. Manafort joins Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser, as former senior Trump advisers who have acknowledged the need to disclose work for foreign interests.Manafort is one of a number of Trump associates whose campaign activities are being scrutinized as part of a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Merkel calls for a vote on legalizing gay marriageGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled a shift on gay marriage, calling for a vote in Parliament on legalizing same-sex unions.Merkel, speaking at a magazine event Monday night, surprised the audience when she said lawmakers should decide whether to bring Germany in line with most Western nations, including the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain and the U.K. The chancellor, who is up for re-election this fall, said same-sex marriage was ""a really personal matter.""Opposition parties in Germany back same-sex marriage.

141,1947525559.xml,"After national parliamentary elections in Germany on Sept. 24, Chancellor Angela Merkel appears almost certain to continue in office, though through what combination of political parties is not yet clear. Hard bargaining among politicians continues to hammer out a working coalition.
The personalities and political parties involved are interesting, and the stakes are high but definitely do not include the risk of world war. That is the most important fact to keep in mind amid all the media alarmism and speculation following the strong showing of an extremist nationalist party.
Chancellor Merkel has been leading her nation with a Grand Coalition involving her own conservative CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union) and the SPD (Social Democratic Party) on the left. The latter is a party with historic roots in the socialist movement, but today without traditional emphasis on nationalization of industry or economic class struggles. The SPD has made clear that the comprehensive coalition would not continue after the election.
The far-right nationalist AfD (Alternative for Germany) party has made the most spectacular gains, winning 94 Bundestag seats with over 12 percent of the vote. The Bundestag, the lower house of the national legislature, forms the government. The AfD had no seats in the last parliament. This marks the first time this type of extreme party has had parliamentary representation since World War II. German constitutional law generally requires parties to reach a vote threshold of 5 percent to secure seats in the Bundestag, a damper on extremist groups.
The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) lost all Bundestag seats in the parliamentary elections held in September 2013, a devastating defeat. This time, the party won 80 seats and could be a coalition partner with the CDU/CSU. The left environmentalist Green Party holds 67 seats, a gain of four, and also could join a coalition.
In the 2013 elections, the powerful CDU/CSU elected the most members of parliament, but fell five seats short of a clear majority. Decimation of the FDP, which had been a governing coalition partner, led to the formation of the Grand Coalition.
This was the third time such a major-party coalition government held power since World War II. Weeks of negotiation preceded the Grand Coalition, and a similar time scenario may unfold this time. There is no reason for alarm if the pace is slow. Modern German politics is deliberate and almost consciously pragmatic.
The decline of the major parties reflects a broad long-term trend in European politics. Political parties traditionally strongly reflected economic class, religion and regional interests and sentiments. With the growth of post-World War II economic prosperity, economic class frictions and associated ideologies including socialism have generally declined along with nationalism. Religion is also fading in political importance in secular Europe.
Regional sensibilities have generally grown, in some cases with dramatic public and political impacts. The rise of the Scottish Nationalist Party in Britain is one example. Political turmoil in Catalonia in Spain illustrates the same trends, including the dangers of violence.
The European Coal and Steel Community, predecessor of the European Union of today, began soon after World War II. Economic integration intentionally became a policy instrument to encourage political stability and peace. In consequence, no single nation dominates Europe today.
Germany, led by Chancellor Merkel, provides an outstanding example of fiscal discipline and prudence, effective military collaboration in NATO, and humanitarian relief for refugees fleeing wars elsewhere.

142,420536123.xml,"         Already weakened by coalition squabbles and disagreements with the European Union, President Lech Kaczynski of Poland announced over the weekend that on Monday he would appoint his twin brother and longtime political partner, Jaroslaw, to succeed Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, according to the Polish news agency PAP.    The resignation of Marcinkiewicz, considered one of the most popular politicians in Poland and one of the more moderate voices in the national-conservative coalition government, was confirmed Saturday. Neither the government nor the president's office would give an official reason for his resignation. The Kaczynskis have been trying to increase their grip on the governing coalition before local elections in November.    Marcinkiewicz, 46, a physicist, was a surprise appointee in October. When the Law and Justice Party won parliamentary elections the preceding month, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who founded the party with his twin, was expected to become prime minister. But after Lech Kaczynski was elected president, he said it would send the wrong signal to the outside world if he and his twin held the two most powerful jobs in Polish politics.    Since coming to power, the Law and Justice Party has clashed with Germany and other European Union nations over economic policy, particularly its protectionist policies and reluctance to privatize further.    A report issued last week by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that Poland's economy, growing at a strong 5.2 percent, could not be sustained as long as the government slowed public ownership, became less open to foreign investment and failed to introduce structural changes, especially in the labor market.    It is difficult to see how the Kaczynski brothers can address these problems, especially before the local elections. Marcinkiewicz had tried to steer a moderate economic and foreign policy but was frequently undermined by President Kaczynski and the government's coalition partners. They include the Farmers' Self-Defense Party, led by Andrzej Lepper, who wants much more social spending, and the nationalist pro-Catholic League of Polish Families, led by the education minister, Roman Giertych.    When both parties were included in the governing coalition, Stefan Meller, the politically unaffiliated foreign minister, resigned, saying he could not support the policies of the government. Marcinkiewicz had no say in Meller's successor; President Kaczynski personally appointed Anna Fotyga, his foreign affairs adviser.    Last month, the finance minister, Zyta Gilowska, resigned over the disclosure that she had been an informer for the communist secret police during the 1980s. When Marcinkiewicz appointed Pawel Wojciechowski, an economic moderate, to fill the post, he was criticized by President Kaczynski for having failed to consult him.    Marcinkiewicz resigned at a low point for Poland's relations with Europe. Just days earlier, President Kaczynski, 57, canceled a ""Weimar Triangle"" meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Jacques Chirac of France.    These meetings were first started 15 years ago soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union to forge closer political, economic and security ties between the three largest countries in the European Union but also to break down decades of suspicions and tension between Warsaw and Berlin.    President Kaczynski's office canceled the meeting with very short notice, officially because he had become ill. But senior Polish diplomats and opposition politicians said the real reason was a satirical article published in the German daily newspaper Taz that described the Kaczynskis as ""the Polish new potatoes.""    Fotyga, Poland's foreign minister, publicly complained to the German Foreign Ministry and demanded a formal apology. After Berlin said it would not comment because it supports freedom of the press, Fotyga said the lack of response was ""shocking"" and compared the article to language used in Der Stuermer, a propaganda weekly during the Nazi era.    Eight of Poland's former foreign ministers accused the government of overreacting and damaging Poland's national interests in an open letter released to newspapers on Thursday.

143,1805722606.xml,"       Anti-Islamic State coalition plans next steps against militia JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. -- Defense Secretary Ash Carter said  Wednesday that leaders at a counter-Islamic State meeting expressed  concerns about what happens after the expected defeat of the  militant group, and whether countries are ready to help stabilize  and rebuild the war-torn cities in Iraq and Syria.  Carter also said that some nations have agreed to step up their  contributions to the fight, as battles for the key cities of Mosul  in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria loom.  Defense and foreign leaders from more than 30 countries are in  Washington for two days of meetings on the next steps to be taken  in the fight to defeat the Islamic State group, which still  maintains control of large sections of Iraq and Syria.  Speaking to reporters after the first day's session wrapped up at  Joint Base Andrews, Carter said a lot of the conversations were  about identifying the needs for reconstruction after the battles  are over.  ""The biggest strategic concern of this group of defense ministers  was that the stabilization and governance effort will lag behind  the military campaign,"" Carter said. ""Making sure there's no such  lag must be a significant strategic priority for us.""  In comments kicking off the meeting, Carter urged a gathering of  defense leaders to do more in the fight against Islamic State group  in Iraq and Syria, as they huddled to map out the next steps in the  campaign.  The gathering comes as Iraqi forces are preparing to encircle and  eventually attempt to retake the key northern city of Mosul. The  meeting of defense leaders lasted about two hours. This is the  fourth time that Carter has convened an anti-Islamic State  coalition meeting.  Appeals court: Texas voter ID law discriminates; fix ordered  AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas' strict voter ID law discriminates against  minorities and the poor and must quickly be scrubbed of those  effects before the November election, a federal appeals court ruled  Wednesday.  The ruling was a striking election-year victory for the  administration of President Barack Obama, which had taken the  unusual step of bringing the U.S. Justice Department into Texas to  help fight the case. It's also a blow to Republican lawmakers whose  2011 law had been enforced in three prior statewide elections.  Voters will still need to show identification at the polls under  the decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of  Appeals, according to attorneys who challenged the law, but a lower  court will now also have to devise a way for Texas to accommodate  those who cannot.  U.K.'s May says no Brexit talks until 'our objectives are clear'  BERLIN -- Britain will not start exit talks with the European Union  until ""our objectives are clear"" -- and that won't be this year,  Prime Minister Theresa May said Wednesday, at her first meeting  with an EU leader as the U.K. begins the long, uncertain process of  leaving the bloc.  May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, on her first  foreign trip as Britain's leader.  May said Britain won't invoke Article 50 of the EU Constitution,  triggering formal exit talks, this year.  Merkel signaled that Germany was prepared to wait.  She said ""it is up to the British government to define its  principles for the EU exit and also to trigger the necessary  steps.""  Merkel said ""nobody wants a long-term stalemate,"" but it was  reasonable to give Britain time to prepare carefully.  Oklahoma man walks free after judge tosses murder conviction  OKLAHOMA CITY -- An Oklahoma judge has vacated the murder  conviction of a man who was serving a life sentence for a 1998  killing after a key witness said she gave false testimony out of  fear for her life.  Oklahoma County District Judge Timothy Henderson vacated the  conviction of 34-year-old Salaam Moore, who was released from  custody Monday night 17 years after authorities opened the case.  Moore's attorneys had argued there was no physical evidence linking  him to the death of Phillip Gonzales.  At trial, prosecutors argued that Moore shot and wounded a woman  named Doris Wright and killed Gonzales in Oklahoma City. Moore was  convicted in 2001 of shooting with intent to kill and first-degree  murder, based primarily on Wright's testimony.  France confirms 3 deaths, special forces in Libya  PARIS -- Three French soldiers were killed in Libya ""while on a  mission,"" the French Defense Ministry announced Wednesday in the  first official confirmation that French special forces have been  active in Libya in apparent operations against the Islamic State.  The Defense Ministry declined to confirm the reported details of  the soldiers' deaths, but President Francois Hollande, addressing a  military training center in southwestern France, specifically  mentioned a ""helicopter crash.""  Libyan officials said the soldiers were killed Sunday in an attack  on their helicopter. An Islamist militia known as the Defending  Benghazi Brigade said it downed the aircraft.  Libya has been gripped by unrest and political upheavals since a  Western-aided uprising in 2011 deposed longtime ruler Moammar  Gadhafi.  Archdiocese in Minn. admits wrongdoing in abuse case  ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis  publicly admitted wrongdoing Wednesday for the way it handled  sexual abuse allegations against a former priest, while prosecutors  dropped criminal charges that alleged the archdiocese turned a  blind eye to his repeated misconduct.  The admission was part of an agreement in a lawsuit that calls for  Archbishop Bernard Hebda to personally participate in at least  three and likely more restorative justice sessions with abuse  victims.  Ramsey County prosecutors filed civil and criminal charges against  the archdiocese last year. The child endangerment charges against  the archdiocese involved Curtis Wehmeyer, who is serving prison  time for molesting two boys in Minnesota and a third in Wisconsin.  He was ultimately removed from the priesthood.  Hawaii congressman dies: Rep. Mark Takai, a first-term Democrat  from Hawaii, died Wednesday of pancreatic cancer.  Takai, 49, announced in May that he would not seek re-election. He  was diagnosed with cancer in October and expressed optimism that he  would recover. But in May he said the cancer had spread.  Pakistan militant: The founder of the Pakistani militant group  Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, pledged Wednesday to support  armed rebels in Indian-ruled Kashmir.  Saeed, who is designated a terrorist by the U.S. government,  addressed thousands of his supporters in Islamabad.

144,1440190182.xml,"       Angela Merkel, known as ""Mrs. Nein,"" is back for a third term as  German chancellor, which is good news for a Europe that needs a  grown-up to keep telling it, ""No!"" Greece, in particular, needs to  hear that message as it tries again to evade more of its debt  obligations and wiggle out of restrictions on how much its  government spends. Merkel sailed to re-election with an impressive 41.5 percent of the  vote last month. She is busy forming a coalition government,  skillfully playing the Green party against the Social Democrats who  are her most likely partner. She may need to compromise on some  domestic issues, such as establishing a national minimum wage. But  when it comes to the debtor nations of southern Europe that want  their obligations wiped away, Merkel can count on the strong  approval of her people when she says, you guessed it, ""Nein.""  The latest country seeking relief at the expense of Germany and the  other financially prudent European nations is Greece -- again. This  would be the third bailout in a little more than three years for  the Aegean nation. The International Monetary Fund is pressing  Germany and other governments to forgive large amounts of the  remaining debt that Greece piled up during a decadelong borrowing  binge.  Under managing director Christine Lagarde, a former lawyer at  Chicago-based Baker & McKenzie who took over in mid-2011, the IMF  has backed off its insistence on austerity measures, saying the  pain those measures caused was, er, painful. It is now pushing for  a sharp reduction in the debt burden of Greece.  The IMF may have gone so far as to leak secret internal documents  showing that its members recognized, accurately, that the first  bailout of Greece in 2010 was mostly aimed at shoring up faltering  European banks and the euro currency union. That deal, arranged by  the IMF, European Union and European Central Bank, was intended to  rescue Europe from disaster, not to fully restore the economy of a  small country knocked flat by its own gross overspending.  Many of the IMF's non-European members were skeptical, even angry,  about bailout terms that they believed would be punitive to Greece  and insufficient to rescue the country from insolvency, the  documents show. Greece did indeed require a second bailout, which  took effect in 2012. Greek debt was restructured at favorable  interest rates and longer maturities. Private creditors took a  severe hit: bondholders settled for as little as 26 cents of every  dollar they were owed.  These revelations, disclosed by the Wall Street Journal, presumably  are intended to bolster the IMF's effort to shame the rest of  Europe into accepting yet another costly ""haircut"" of Greek debt at  the expense of taxpayers in Germany and other nations that hold  those bonds. That would set a poor example for Spain and Italy,  much larger economies that need to start living within their means,  as well as for Ireland and Portugal, which made the deep cuts  required in exchange for debt relief like Greece received.  Saying ""no"" is difficult because Greece has suffered terribly in  spite of its two bailouts. Six years of recession have led to  record levels of unemployment, business failures, pay cuts, pension  reductions and other fiscal belt-tightening. A generation of young  Greeks has been unable to start careers because opportunity has  evaporated. Polling suggests that many Greek citizens place the  blame for this disaster where it belongs: at the feet of their  political leaders who used every available means to squander the  country's future through irresponsible borrowing and spending.  To an extent, Greece is starting to right itself. It projects that  its long, long recession will end next year. Tourism, a vital  industry, is staging a comeback. Its debt load, while very heavy,  is at a low interest rate and a long maturity. Greece has seen  fresh public sector strikes against maintaining the austerity  measures it accepted in exchange for the previous bailouts. One  Greek minister beseeched Germany to give it money with no strings  attached: ""We will give the money back to the Germans when we can.""  Merkel has not ruled out aid to Greece. Far from it. The Greeks  still are part of the euro currency union, and their fellow members  have a financial and political interest in keeping the eurozone  intact. But there is no reason for Merkel to forgo repayment of  money already lent.  After her election, Merkel let the Greeks know that she will not be  writing any blank checks, no matter how sincere the promises to pay  the money back some day. As Merkel put it: ""We should not stop  exercising pressure for the agreed reforms to be carried out.""  In other words, to those who want money for nothing: ""Nein!""  ",2013-10-09
145,1854391542.xml,"       Every year is a wild ride, filled with unexpected delights and horrors. Celebrities die by the dozens. Politics, business and sports news surprises and often confounds us. Those who value their reputation for sagacity decline to speculate publicly about what will happen in the next 12 months, preferring instead to stroke their chins and explain, often in think pieces, why what transpired over the past 12 months was inevitable in retrospect.  But others of us don't care that events make fools of those who aspire to clairvoyance. We know that predictions -- calling them guesses isn't unfair given how often they're wrong -- are simply another way of looking forward, of reminding or bracing ourselves for what's ahead.  Such a look seems particularly important given that we're about to inaugurate a thin-skinned, compulsively dishonest, unreflective and unpredictable president at a time when ugly tribalism is metastatic both at home and abroad.  So in that spirit, here are the results of last week's 36-question online survey in which I asked readers to take their best stabs at forecasting 2017 compared with my own semi-informed inclinations.  In 16 cases, a majority or plurality of readers and I are in agreement:  Veteran Democratic Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan will be re-elected to his leadership post in January.  Rumblings are louder than ever this time that a challenger will rise to unseat him, but, folks, it ain't gonna happen.  State lawmakers and Gov. Bruce Rauner will not come to a full-year budget agreement.  Party leaders are already in Campaign 2018 mode and the state will stagger along, bleeding alarmingly from a variety of self-inflicted wounds.  Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke will be convicted in the 2014 shooting death of Laquan McDonald, but of a lesser charge than first-degree murder.  As far as Donald Trump's first year as president, we agree that, campaign declarations notwithstanding, he won't order a halt to commercial flights from the U.S. to Cuba, won't oversee any efforts to prosecute Hillary Clinton, won't get funding for a new border wall with Mexico and won't withdraw the U.S. from the multilateral Iran nuclear deal.  The gross domestic product will be slightly lower in the third quarter of 2017 under Trump than it was in the third quarter of 2016 under President Barack Obama; the unemployment rate will rise under Trump, but still be under 6 percent by year's end; and Trump's job-approval rating will be under 40 percent at the end of 2017 (Obama's is now close to 60 percent).  The Democratic party will not select African-American Muslim U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota to be its national chairman, and 2017 will break 2016's record as the hottest ever according to average global temperature measurements.  And in sports, the White Sox won't make the postseason, the Blackhawks won't win the Stanley Cup, John Fox will lose his job as head coach of the Bears and Alabama will win the NCAA college football playoff.  On 20 predictions, however, we disagree.  I think Chris Kennedy will enter the Democratic gubernatorial primary race. Readers think that, of the two ultra-wealthy businessmen now considering a run, neither Kennedy nor J.B. Pritzker will decide to run.  I think Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will be among the fall guys to lose their jobs in 2017, and the number of homicides in the city will drop below 500 after the sickening surge to more than 700 in 2016.  I think former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett will get a four- to seven-year prison sentence for her admitted role in a bribery and kickback scheme; readers think she'll get a seven- to nine-year sentence.  A strong majority of readers think former U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock of Peoria will be convicted in 2017 on federal charges that he misused funds while in office. I think the gears of justice grind so slowly that he'll still be awaiting trial a year from now.  Regarding Trump, readers disagree with my predictions that he'll contrive to back away from his promises to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and to repeal the controversial insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).  I think Trump's first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and just one of his Cabinet nominees won't survive the confirmation process.  Readers think his initial choice for the Supreme Court will be seated but that the Senate will reject two or more of his Cabinet picks.  I think the estimated annual federal budget deficit will balloon under Trump to more than $600 billion; readers think it will grow only slightly from its current $441 billion and remain under $600 billion. But I think the Dow Jones industrial average will end the year between 20,000 and 22,500, slightly higher than it is now, while readers see the key market indicator falling slightly.  I see national average gas prices rising next year under Trump to more than $3.50 a gallon from about $2.25 today.  Readers project the price will be between $2.75 and $3.50 a gallon.  The wave of right-wing nationalism that's infecting the globe looks to me likely to cost German Chancellor Angela Merkel her job in 2017 and to result in Marine Le Pen's election as president of France. The hive mind of readers says no way.  But readers think the U.S. will see a terrorist attack on our shores worse than the June 2016 attack on an Orlando nightclub that killed 49. Whereas I, optimistically, don't.  Elsewhere, readers disagreed with gut feelings that tell me Trevor Noah will be out as host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, Fred Hoiberg will be out as the coach of the Chicago Bulls, the Cubs will repeat as World Series champs and interception specialist Matt Barkley will be the Bears' starting quarterback next season.  By tradition, we will gather in this space nearly 12 months from now to chuckle at how wrong we were about so much.  That is, if chuckling about anything is still possible.

146,1816606767.xml,"       Religion and politics collide, canceling Israeli train service JERUSALEM -- Israeli commuters began their work week Sunday with massive traffic jams and a cancellation of train service along one of the country's busiest routes following a religious and political scuffle that had threatened to shake the governing coalition.    The crisis erupted over the weekend after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, made an 11th-hour decision to halt routine railway repairs scheduled on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.    Orthodox Jewish law forbids work on the Sabbath, and a religious party in the coalition had threatened to quit the government unless Netanyahu halted the repairs.    Netanyahu's transport minister, Yisrael Katz, canceled a key train route on the Tel Aviv-Haifa line Sunday because of the delayed repairs. The government dispatched extra buses for some 90,000 affected commuters.    Netanyahu's office accused Katz, a senior figure in the ruling Likud Party, of orchestrating the crisis to undercut the prime minister.    Katz and Netanyahu's close relationship tanked last month when Katz, chairman of the Likud secretariat, held a vote to revoke some powers from Netanyahu to prevent him from being able to unilaterally appoint supporters to party positions.    Train maintenance work has long taken place on the Sabbath, without drawing the ire of the ultra-Orthodox.    But ultra-Orthodox news sites doggedly covered news of the Sabbath train work recently, and ultra-Orthodox constituents egged on their politicians on social media to do something to prevent it.    By evening, train service resumed and the tempest quieted down.  Nationalists overtake Merkel's party in German state election    BERLIN -- A nationalist, anti-immigration party performed strongly in a German state election Sunday in the region where Chancellor Angela Merkel has her political base, overtaking her conservatives to take second place amid discontent with her migrant policies.    The 3-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 20.8 percent of votes in the election for the state legislature in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, home to 1.6 million of the country's 80 million people. Merkel's Christian Democrats polled 19 percent, their worst result yet in the state.    The center-left Social Democrats, who led the outgoing state government in a coalition with the conservatives, remained the strongest party with 30.6 percent support.    Sunday's regional vote was the first of five before a national election expected next September.  Eastern gorilla gets added to critically endangered list    HONOLULU -- The world's largest living primate has been listed as critically endangered, making four of the six great ape species only one step away from extinction, according to a report released Sunday at the World Conservation Congress in Hawaii.    The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, cited illegal hunting in downgrading the status of the eastern gorilla on its Red List of Endangered Species.    The organization said an estimated 5,000 eastern gorillas remain in the wild, a decline of about 70 percent over the past 20 years.    For the gorillas of the Congo, where the majority of the population lives, conservation will be a struggle because of political instability, said primatologist Russell Mittermeier.  Oil pipeline protest turns violent in North Dakota    BISMARCK, N.D. -- A protest of a four-state, $3.8 billion oil pipeline turned violent after tribal officials say construction crews destroyed American Indian burial and cultural sites on private land.    Morton County sheriff's office spokeswoman Donnell Preskey said four private security guards and two guard dogs were injured after several hundred protesters confronted construction crews Saturday afternoon at the site just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. One of the security officers was taken to a Bismarck hospital for undisclosed injuries.    Tribe spokesman Steve Sitting Bear said protesters reported that six people were bitten by security dogs. At least 30 people were pepper-sprayed, he said. Preskey said authorities had no reports of protesters being injured.  Under pressure, S. Sudan OKs new peacekeepers    JUBA, South Sudan -- South Sudan has agreed to allow a 4,000-strong regional protection force approved by the U.N. Security Council after first rejecting the peacekeepers as a violation of its sovereignty.    Sunday's announcement came after Security Council representatives met with South Sudan President Salva Kiir during a rare visit to the turbulent East African country.    The threat of an arms embargo loomed over the meeting, as the council has said it would pursue one if South Sudan didn't accept the additional peacekeepers. The U.N. already has 12,000 peacekeepers in the country, and South Sudan has been wary of giving it more authority.    Protecting civilians has become an even more critical issue after fighting erupted in the capital, Juba, in July, killing hundreds and sparking fears of a return to civil war.  Nigeria: Some in military are selling arms to Boko Haram    MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Nigeria's military says some officers are selling arms and ammunition to Boko Haram, indicating the corruption bedeviling the country's fight against the Islamic extremists continues despite government efforts to halt graft.    The admission comes three weeks after Nigerian army officials said a military tribunal is trying 16 officers and enlisted personnel accused of offenses related to the fight against Boko Haram, including the theft and sale of ammunition.    President Muhammadu Buhari has blamed corruption for the deaths of thousands in the seven-year Islamic uprising that has killed more than 20,000.    Children who escaped Boko Haram are dying of starvation in refugee camps in the northeast, where the government is investigating the alleged theft of food aid.    French minorities: Crowds rallied Sunday in Paris to urge an end to violence against the Asian community. The spark for the protest was the beating death of Chinese tailor Chaolin Zhangh last month after a robbery attempt. The Chinese immigrant community says it is often targeted by armed robbers and violence.    Kashmir protests: Around 100 people were injured Sunday as Indian government forces fired tear gas and shotgun pellets to quell thousands of protesters who hurled rocks and burned a government office in the Indian portion of Kashmir after authorities attempted to block marchers, police said.

147,1114307120.xml,"       As President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney begin the final two weeks of their campaign and with polls showing the Republican challenger with a real chance of victory, many observers abroad are saying: Wait, what? From Europe to China to the Middle East, perceptions of the contest have lagged behind indications that the two men are in a virtual dead heat. Obama remains widely popular abroad, and there are signs that many leaders are unprepared for a Romney presidency.  In Western Europe, few people can imagine Romney in office. In China, officials have been focused on the intrigues of their impending leadership transition, though many worry that both American candidates have been beating up on their country. And in the Middle East, political chaos has kept many activists and officials from contemplating the election much at all.  In Europe, leaders have good reason to avoid the issue: From the Scottish Highlands to the heel of Italy, it's Obama country all the way. One survey last month from the German Marshall Fund found Europeans breaking 75 percent for Obama and 8 percent for Romney. Even conservative leaders have maneuvered themselves to appear closer to the U.S. president, reasoning that they can get their own electoral bump from doing so, although popular enthusiasm for Obama has diminished after a public frenzy in 2008.  Three years into an economic crisis in the eurozone that has threatened to spill into the United States, many European leaders have built alliances with the Obama administration that they worry would reset to zero under Romney, analysts say. The Republican challenger has pointed to Europeans as symbols of the socialist big-government state that he says Obama wants to build.  In Germany, the bulwark of austerity in Europe, Chancellor Angela Merkel would probably prefer an Obama victory, analysts say, although Ronald Reagan was a hero of her youth. Her center-right Christian Democratic Union has historically aligned with Republicans, but Merkel has focused on a vision of fiscal sustainability that includes high taxes along with lower government spending.  A mid-October Emnid poll for the Bild newspaper found that 82 percent of Germans expected Obama to win, compared with 11 percent anticipating a Romney victory.  ""There is so much unfinished business"" between the United States and the rest of the world, said Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Merkel ""is afraid the Republicans would have to go through the same process of understanding the euro crisis again.""  Top Christian Democratic Union officials who visited the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., this summer were careful to tell German newspapers that they were friendly with Democrats too. The same dynamic is on display in other European countries led by conservatives.  In Britain, Romney is viewed as representing a party that has swung further and further to the right on social issues, thus sharing less affinity with his counterparts on this side of the Atlantic than Republicans once did. The coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative, has embraced the cause of same-sex marriage and vowed to vigorously combat global warming.  The gulf between the Republican Party and British Conservatives was clearly on display during Romney's visit to London ahead of the 2012 Olympics, when his suggestion that the city wasn't quite prepared to host the Games generated stinging rebukes from Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson, a fellow Conservative.  In China, far more people appear to be paying attention to the U.S. presidential race than in 2008. Internet use has exploded, and the non-state-owned news media have become more vibrant. There have been reports on Romney's investments in the country, along with fascination about the democratic process.  But as China prepares for its once-in-a-decade power transition, which will come just days after the U.S. election, most official energy has been directed toward China's future.  Much of the Chinese coverage of the U.S. presidential campaign has focused less on who might win than on China-bashing rhetoric from the candidates. Obama and Romney have had heated exchanges about China's alleged currency manipulation, unfair trade practices and the loss of American jobs, each accusing the other of being soft on the issues. The fear in China is that the victor will find it hard to dial back the tone after the election.  The Foreign Ministry and the official Xinhua News Agency recently took the unusual step of urging both candidates to cool it.  ""The fierce presidential race seems to have morphed into a contest in which the one who plays tougher on China has better chances to win,"" Xinhua said in an Oct. 16 editorial.  There are leaders, and populations, who favor a Romney victory. Eastern Europe has long seen Republicans as more sympathetic to their struggles with Russia, and former Polish President Lech Walesa endorsed Romney over the summer.  In Israel, where the Middle East polices of Obama have been viewed with suspicion, many people are quietly rooting for a Romney victory. Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to project a nonpartisan stance, he has been friends with Romney for decades, and his relationship with Obama has been cool.  Elsewhere in the Middle East, many countries are focused inward on troubled economies and shaky democratic transitions in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. There is also a widespread and long-standing belief that regardless of who the president is, U.S. foreign policy will always be the same. Credit: By Michael Birnbaum and Keith B.

148,2131510471.xml,"Turkey's steady march toward dictatorship just went into full gallop. Voters on Sunday narrowly approved a raft of constitutional changes that shift even more power to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who already maintains an iron grip over his country. Beginning in 2019, the post of prime minister will disappear, and Erdogan can make Cabinet appointments without any parliamentary oversight. His control over the country's judiciary will expand. He can also dissolve parliament at any time, for any reason. And, starting with the 2019 elections, Erdogan, who took power as prime minister in 2003, can run for two more five-year terms.Erdogan's margin of victory was razor-thin, and there were strong indications that the vote was far from fair. International election observers criticized the decision by Turkish election officials to allow as valid more than a million ballots that had been cast without an official stamp. Without the stamp, authorities can't be sure those ballots aren't fraudulent. During the campaign, authorities arrested a leading opposition politician campaigning against the ""Yes"" movement and cracked down on journalists critical of the referendum.An undemocratic election shouldn't surprise anyone, given Erdogan's track record for authoritarian governance. After a failed coup attempt, his government arrested more than 40,000 perceived opponents of the regime and purged more than 100,000 from their government jobs. Erdogan blamed the coup attempt on his primary political rival, Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who once was a close Erdogan ally and who now lives in Pennsylvania. Washington has rejected Ankara's requests for Gulen's extradition, saying Turkey must convince U.S. courts that there's enough evidence to charge Gulen with a crime.So far, the West has reacted to the election with measured criticism. The State Department said irregularities on the day of the election and the run-up to it led to an ""uneven playing field"" in favor of the ""Yes"" movement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the close vote reflected the deep divisions within Turkish society, and she urged Erdogan loyalists and opposition leaders to talk out their differences.If Western leaders choose their words carefully about Turkey, it's because they have to. Turkey is a NATO member integral to the fight against Islamic State in Syria. It allows the U.S. to use an air base at Incirlik for its airstrikes and drone flights into Syria. It also has provided haven to more than 3 million Syrian refugees and has a deal with European leaders to keep refugees from traveling on to Europe.But if Turkey is going to fulfill its decadeslong goal to join the European Union, it needs Western backing. Expecting Erdogan to reform isn't realistic, but that doesn't mean Europe should compromise its principles for EU inclusion. Those principles require EU applicant nations to maintain ""stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights ...."" Turkey is veering away from -- rather than approaching -- those principles. Erdogan also has been talking about holding a referendum on the reinstatement of the death penalty, which would nix the country's bid for EU membership.Erdogan can't have it both ways. He can't run roughshod over democratic principles and then expect the EU to welcome Turkey, no questions asked. Turkey's too valuable in the fight against Islamic State to treat like a pariah. But it's not so valuable that the European community should abandon core ideals it applies to other countries that join.",2017-04-18

""Best ally of Putin,"" said Tuesday's front page of France's sober-minded Le Monde.""Trump makes it easy for Putin,"" echoed German's Die Welt.""Trump 0, Putin 1,"" said the Finnish business daily Kauppalehti, playing off the just-concluded World Cup soccer tournament in Russia.In globe-spanning day-after coverage, Helsinki, the Finnish capital where Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump met Monday, suddenly became shorthand for what was widely described as a very bad day for the U.S. president.The leading Italian daily Corriere della Sera said Helsinki marked an ""American surrender,"" describing Trump's performance as ""obliging side man to a victorious Vladimir Putin.""Traditional U.S. allies in Europe, having already absorbed a blast of criticism from Trump at last week's NATO summit in Brussels, were dismayed anew by his seeming show of solidarity with Putin over the issue of election interference by Moscow.That issue hits close to home for key U.S. friends: European elections also have been hit by Russian cyberattacks, which previously have drawn strong pushback from leaders like France's President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May.In Washington on Tuesday, Trump walked back his Helsinki comments, saying he accepted the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia had interfered in the presidential vote. ""Could be other people also,"" he said. ""A lot of people out there.""But the summit's impact lingered. Britain's Guardian newspaper, in its lead headline on the Helsinki meeting, rolled out the T-word -- ""treasonous"" -- albeit in quotes.Corriere della Sera summarized Putin's stance as asserting ""zero interference"" in the 2016 U.S. vote. ""Trump believes him,"" it added flatly.The Helsinki encounter also won plaudits on Europe's far right. Italy's hard-line Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who was in Moscow to meet Russian officials, praised Russia for having a government ""that acts in the interests of its people"" and lamented that such behavior was ""rare in Europe.""Some took a long view -- and a gloomy one -- of the summit's still-to-be-felt repercussions. Italian daily La Repubblica saw a symbolic end to the rules-based postwar world order.""Do Trump and Putin have alternative plans to substitute it?"" it asked in a front-page editorial. An op-ed in Le Monde called the Trump-Putin meeting a ""dangerous liaison"" for the entire world.""Trump is praising Putin while at the same time he is constantly attacking without any reason America's closest allies,"" columnist Martin Klingst wrote in Germany's Die Zeit online.Another German commentator, Stefan Kornelius, wrote in the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung that the world's fate lay in the hands of ""two easily irritated senior citizens, one of whom is possibly somewhat smarter than the other.""Britain's tabloids, fresh from covering Trump's tumultuous visit to the United Kingdom last week, had a field day.""Putin's poodle,"" the Daily Mirror dubbed Trump. The Daily Express spoke of Putin's ""new best buddy"" and had a double-page spread with the headline: ""A nod and a wink ... and the Cold War ends.""In an op-ed, the Guardian said Trump was inadvertently prescient when he previewed last week's swing through Europe by saying the meeting with Putin would be the ""easiest"" of his stops.Some outlets stuck with a more straightforward approach in news coverage but paired that with scathing commentary.The Irish Times, in a news story, cited a ""barrage of US criticism"" over Helsinki. But in a separate opinion piece by Washington-based columnist Suzanne Lynch, it called Trump's performance ""humiliating,"" saying that the news conference ""shows a rambling, inexperienced and amateur US president.""CAPTION: Photo: Journalists from around the world follow the meeting between  Presidents Putin and Trump in Helsinki, on Monday.

151,1093512077.xml,"       House report warns against 2 Chinese firms WASHINGTON -- The federal government should ""view with suspicion"" attempts by two Chinese telecommunications companies to expand in the U.S. market because of a strong risk they would aid spying and cyber theft by China, a yearlong investigation by the House Intelligence Committee has concluded.  In a 52-page report accompanied by a classified annex, House investigators said that Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., two private companies with deep ties to the Chinese government, had failed to satisfy security concerns.  The report recommended that the U.S. government bar the two firms from access to any sensitive U.S. networks and from acquiring U.S. assets. The companies make routers, switches and others parts of the worldwide telecommunications nerve system. With $32 billion in annual revenue, Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, while ZTE is the fifth largest.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., and ranking member C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger, D-Md., appeared Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" to discuss the probe.  ""If I were an American company today ... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" Rogers said.  Huawei ""exhibits a pattern of disregard for the intellectual property rights"" of other firms, the report said.  Convoy protesting drones stops trek at danger zone  A convoy protesting U.S. drone strikes led by Imran Khan, the cricket star turned politician, stopped short Sunday of its goal to reach Pakistan's lawless tribal area after threats of an attack from the Pakistani Taliban.  After a chaotic and grueling two-day trek from Islamabad, Khan halted the procession just past Tank, the last town before South Waziristan, a dangerous region of the tribal area that is generally considered a no-go zone for Westerners and others.  Ga. congressman blasts evolution in speech  Evolution, embryology and the big-bang theory are major underpinnings of mainstream science. And Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., a physician who sits on the House science committee, says they are ""lies straight from the pit of hell.""  Broun, unopposed for re-election in November, made the comments in a Sept. 27 speech at a church in Hartwell, Ga., according to The Associated Press.  His spokeswoman said he ""was speaking off the record"" to a church group.  Israeli missile reportedly hurts 2 militants, others  GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- A missile fired by an Israeli aircraft hit and wounded two Palestinian militants and eight bystanders Sunday in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian hospital officials said.  The militants were riding a motorcycle near the town of Rafah which borders Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. One of them and a bystander were in a critical condition, the officials said. The bystanders included three children.  Seoul to extend range of ballistic missiles  SEOUL, South Korea -- The U.S. and South Korea have reached a landmark agreement to extend the range of Seoul's ballistic missiles by more than twice the current limit to counter the threat from North Korea, the Seoul government said Sunday.  The move to significantly boost the South's missile capabilities along with development of advanced aerial reconnaissance vehicles is likely to rattle the communist North.

Libyan lawmakers oust prime minister from job  BENGHAZI, Libya -- Lawmakers Sunday removed Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur after rejecting his choice of Cabinet ministers in the latest setback to Libya's first elected government since the ouster last year of Moammar Gadhafi.  The parliament decisively voted down Abushagur's proposal for a 10-member emergency Cabinet to run the country for six months. Lawmakers now will have to select a new prime minister, a process that could take several weeks.  Greece readies for likely tense visit from Merkel  German Chancellor Angela Merkel will tell Greeks she wants to keep their country in the euro when she visits Athens this week, but she faces a hostile reception from a people worn down by years of austerity and recession.  Many Greeks blame Merkel, who has publicly chastised them over the past three years, for the nation's plight. Opponents have promised protests Tuesday during her first visit since the euro zone crisis erupted in 2009. Some 6,000 police will be deployed in Athens.  Naked student killed by cop at Alabama school  A campus police officer fatally shot a naked student who was acting erratically and in a threatening manner at the University of South Alabama in Mobile.  The shooting occurred early Saturday after officers heard banging on a window at the campus police station. An officer found Gilbert Thomas Collar, an 18-year-old freshman, nude and acting erratically, according the school's website. Despite being ordered to stop, Collar rushed the officer and then was shot in the chest.

152,1973364379.xml,"It was an agonizing calculation. To get his wife and three daughters to safety, Abed Fhili, 44, left them behind in a Syria suffocating from war. His thinking went: The route through Syria, Turkey and the Balkans is too dangerous. Better to go with just his son, reach a safe country and file for family reunification so the others could follow by plane. But three years later and living in a small town in eastern Germany, the closest he has come to seeing his wife and daughters is through video chats on his phone.Cases such as Fhili's are at the center of a dispute that helped torpedo German talks to form a governing coalition last month, and they are a critical fault line in the negotiations to come. On one side: conservatives who say that Germany cannot afford to take in any more migrants. On the other: progressives who argue that asylum seekers will adjust much better if they are not separated from their loved ones.In a country where policies have traditionally been forged through consensus, there is little agreement on what to do with families such as Fhili's. The dispute has become fraught with emotion and symbolism, reflecting an even deeper ideological division over how welcoming Germany should be to outsiders.Fhili is one of roughly 113,000 asylum seekers who have been granted what is called subsidiary protection -- a legal permit to stay in Germany for typically one year, after which conditions in their home countries are reassessed. Subsidiary protection is different from full-fledged refugee status, which grants family reunification rights for spouses, children and parents of minors.In 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government passed a law to ban people with subsidiary protection from rights to family reunification until March 2018. Around the same time, the German government started giving subsidiary protection, not the refugee status, to an increasing number of asylum seekers from war-torn countries such as Syria.Stephan Harbarth, vice chairman of Merkel's party and its Bavarian counterpart, says that granting family reunification rights to all asylum seekers would overburden cities and frustrate integration efforts. ""Especially if Germany has a more liberal family reunification policy than other countries like Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Balkan countries, we'll create incentives that'll encourage more and more people to come here,"" he said.After Merkel admitted more than 1 million asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016, her Christian Democratic Union vowed to take a tougher line on refugee policy. To limit the number of future arrivals, Harbarth and the party want to extend the ban on family reunification for asylum seekers such as Fhili.In coalition talks that followed an inconclusive September election, the CDU was joined in its hard-line stance by the pro-business Free Democratic Party. But the third member of the would-be government, the Green Party, advocated an earlier phaseout of the ban.""Family reunification is one of the most important and best ways of allowing for legal migration,"" said Luise Amtsberg, a Greens member of Parliament. ""We always complain that people are coming illegally over the Mediterranean, but in the case of family reunification, we can determine who comes and from where.""With the parties at odds on family reunification and other issues, the coalition talks broke down as the Free Democrats walked out -- triggering one of the worst crises of Merkel's 12 years as chancellor.Since then, Merkel has received a potential lifeline, with the center-left Social Democrats agreeing to talk with her Christian Democrats about a potential ""grand coalition"" to govern the country. But for the Social Democrats, as for the Greens, family reunification is a sticking point.""Experience shows that when someone lives in Germany for long periods of time, their chances of integration are much better when their families are here,"" said Aydan Ozoguz, who is a deputy chair of the Social Democrats and Germany's federal commissioner for migration, refugees and integration.Ozoguz, whose party agreed to the temporary ban as part of the last government, said the Social Democrats acquiesced to the prohibition on family reunifications in 2016 only because German courts were overwhelmed with the cases of asylum seekers and the subsidiary status applied to only a tiny fraction of them.""But the situation is completely different now,"" she said ""I can't imagine that the Social Democrats would vote to extend the ban.""One reason that there is so little consensus among Germany's parties is their divergence on a fundamental issue: migrant numbers. Harbarth and the Christian Democrats cite an estimate that 300,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany if the reunification ban is phased out. But the Social Democrats and Greens say the real number is far smaller, much closer to 100,000.Herbert Brucker, the economist who calculated an estimate on behalf of the Federal Employment Agency, concluded that only 50,000 to 60,000 additional migrants would come to Germany if the government permitted family reunification for those with subsidiary protection. Given that lower figure, Brucker said, the issue may be more a perceived problem than a real one -- with people's thinking tainted by the memory of the sudden crisis in 2015 and a fear that Germany will be caught off guard again.""There are fundamentally different perspectives,"" said Andrea Rommele, a professor of political science at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Whereas the center-right parties want a clear upper limit on refugees, the center-left parties argue that the government cannot put a limit on people coming to Germany for humanitarian reasons. There isn't even agreement on which countries are safe for asylum seekers to return to and which are not, Rommele said.Some human rights groups are taking cases such as Fhili's to court, arguing that families and children's rights are protected under the German constitution, and by the human rights conventions of the United Nations and the European Union. ""Children's best interests have to be respected,"" said Sigrun Krause, a lawyer with the advocacy group Jumen.For Fhili, the daily worries about his wife and daughters make it difficult to concentrate on anything else. ""They want us to integrate into German society, but how can we integrate when our family isn't here and all of our thoughts and all of our heart is in Syria?"" he said.Germany is not likely to have a new government before the new year, when politicians have to decide on the fate of tens of thousands of families like Fhili's.CAPTION: Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is having trouble forming a  governing coalition over disagreement on immigration.

153,418927237.xml,"      The web of secret money transfers trapping Germany's conservatives in a financing scandal widened Sunday with allegations that the French government of former President Francois Mitterrand funneled millions of dollars to support former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 1994 re-election. The scandal involving allegations of money trading hands in suitcases, arms deals stretching from Canada to Saudi Arabia and the suicide of a party accountant took a further bizarre twist Sunday after a fake statement was faxed to news media saying Kohl was ready to name anonymous donors to the Christian Democratic party. Kohl told the Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the fax was a forgery and reiterated that he would not identify the donors from whom he has admitted soliciting $1 million that was kept off party books. The source of the fake fax was unknown. Kohl's refusal to name names has become the key issue in the scandal. Parliament has launched an inquiry to examine whether bribes or kickbacks influenced government decisions under Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998. He also is the subject of a criminal investigation. Kohl stepped down as honorary chairman of the Christian Democratic Party last week under pressure from party leaders, who demanded he identify the donors. Angela Merkel, party secretary general, met with senior party leaders Sunday evening to review an audit of the party's finances. She told reporters that accountants were unable to clarify where $5.7 million in party money had come from, although $1 million was believed to be from Kohl's anonymous donors. The audit was to be made public Monday, but Merkel said it revealed nothing new about the part of the scandal disclosed over the weekend involving Mitterand, who died in 1996, and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine. ARD television reported Saturday that Mitterrand arranged payment of $15.7 million to the Christian Democrats and that the money was transferred as part of alleged bribes totaling $44 million paid by Elf-Aquitaine for its 1992 purchase of the former East German Leuna refinery. The alleged bribes have long been the subject of investigation by Swiss and French prosecutors. Officials in the German chancellor's office also have been searching for missing government files on the privatization deal sought by parliament as part of its inquiry into the scandal. The government said it would appoint a special investigator to track down what happened to the files. ARD said there was no evidence Kohl was aware of the $15.7 million transfer, and Michael Roik, Kohl's spokesman, called the allegation a character assassination of the former chancellor. In a joint report with French Television 2, ARD cited sources close to Mitterrand as saying the money was not bribes but was intended to serve ""state interests for Europe."" The report said the French and German secret services met regularly with middlemen in a Geneva hotel to make the payments. Kohl's refusal to identify donors has prompted speculation about their identity, including international Jewish groups, arms dealers, real estate magnates and others. Another possibility raised is that the donors do not exist and that the story is a cover for kickbacks for various business deals that might have been illegally held in overseas bank accounts during Kohl's years in office.

154,420390655.xml,"         Johannes Rau, the former German president who urged his country to open up to foreigners and promoted deeper ties with Israel, died Friday at age 75, his office said.    No cause of death was given, but Mr. Rau had suffered from persistent health problems in recent years.    During his 1999-2004 term as president, he paid particular attention to cementing Germany's ties with Israel, rooted in the countries' shared history of the Holocaust.    ""Germany has lost an extraordinary personality,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said, praising Mr. Rau's ""tireless commitment to democracy, justice, human rights and understanding between people.""    In 2000, he became the first person to speak German in the Israeli parliament, making an emotional plea for forgiveness.    ""With the people of Israel watching, I bow in humility before those murdered, before those who don't have graves where I could ask them for forgiveness,"" he said.    Mr. Rau, the son of a Protestant pastor, was born in the western city of Wuppertal. He dropped out of high school and worked as a journalist and at a Protestant publishing house before entering politics as a member of the Social Democratic Party.    He became mayor of Wuppertal in 1969 and, in 1978, the governor of his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state and the country's industrial heartland -- a post that he held for two decades.    The Social Democrats made him their candidate in a failed effort to unseat conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the 1987 general election, and he lost a first bid for president in 1994.    Mr. Rau persuaded German lawmakers to elect him on his second try in 1999, fending off concerns about his health. His left kidney was removed in 1992, and he had an operation in 2000 to replace a stomach artery.    He was inaugurated in July 1999 in the German parliament's last session in Bonn before the government moved to the historic capital of Berlin.

155,1881818646.xml,"""We Germans are the only people in the world that have planted a monument of shame in the heart of their capital.""
- Bjoern Hoecke, German politician and a leading member of Germany's upstart nationalist party, Alternative for Germany
""He who resists dealing with the past is ill-prepared for the future.""
- Wolfgang Schauble, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's finance minister
The nationalist juggernaut sweeping across Europe has taken an ugly turn in Germany, where leading members of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have been calling for an end to atonement for Germany's Nazi past. Bjoern Hoecke, one of the party's leading firebrands, has urged the country to take a ""180-degree turn"" away from mindfulness of its Nazi history. He called Berlin's famed Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe ""a memorial of disgrace."" Germany's history, he said, ""is made ugly and ridiculous.""
Elena Roon, an AfD member from Bavaria and a candidate for parliament, recently posted a picture of Adolf Hitler on a WhatsApp chat with the headline, ""Missing since 1945"" and a caption that read, ""Adolf, please respond! Germany needs you!""
The Alternative for Germany party rose to prominence on its strident anti-refugee policies and its push for Germany to detach from the European Union's common currency, the euro. Those stances resonated deeply with a citizenry fed up with a bloated European Union and an open-door policy to waves of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa.
Running away from history, however, is a dangerous step backward for a nation whose postwar identity has been shaped by coming to grips with its dark and difficult past.
Party leaders have had plenty of opportunity to cut the tether on Hoecke and Roon, whose remarks and actions have caused a good deal of discord. Despite all the hand-wringing going on in the AfD, Hoecke and Roon have not been ousted. That inaction is causing damage - the party's poll numbers have been slipping, and Alternative for Germany is in danger of becoming a nonfactor in national elections slated for September.
At a time when nationalism and insularity are on the rise around the globe, it is heartening to see so many Germans recoil from AfD. Countries with troubled chapters in their past heal and move forward when they resolve to learn from those chapters. To shove them aside is to remain mired in intolerance, paranoia and fear. Is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, which persecutes political opponents and chokes civil society, conveniently forgets the genocide committed under Josef Stalin and instead embraces the Soviet leader as a guardian of Russian order and national prestige?
Every country needs to acknowledge every part of its history - the bad with the good. And Germany's uncompromising postwar acceptance of its history represents an important part of its identity. Germany is Europe's leading economy, a democratic success story and one of America's strongest allies in the struggle against terrorism and an increasingly aggressive Russia. It's because of its dark past that Germany embraces multiculturalism and tolerance. Disavowing that history betrays Germany's identity today.

156,1822821672.xml,"[00:00:00]   STEVE KROFTThere are only a [00:00:05]few things that   could derail the U.S. economic recovery that finally seems to be   underway, [00:00:10]and one of them is the debt crisis in Europe,   along with the recession that is now [00:00:15]sweeping across   the continent. It's similar in many ways to the financial crisis   that [00:00:20]leveled the U.S. economy in 2008. Except that in   Europe, it's not just the [00:00:25]banks that are in danger of   going broke; it's entire countries. Greece has [00:00:30]already   defaulted on more than a hundred billion dollars of public debt.   Ireland and [00:00:35]Portugal have needed massive bailouts to   stay solvent. Italy and Spain are [00:00:40]just hanging on in   what has turned out to be an imperfect economic union.   [00:00:45]At stake is the survival of the European currency, the   euro, and the [00:00:50]economic future of America's largest   trading partner. [00:00:55]   STEVE KROFTThe European Union has all[00:01:00] the   accoutrements of nationhood: its own flag, its own anthem, its   [00:01:05]own parliament, its own huge bureaucracy, and its own   currency--the euro--[00:01:10]shared by seventeen of its   twenty-seven members. It's a loose [00:01:15]economic alliance of   countries and faded empires with different languages, cultures   and [00:01:20]customs that have more or less been at war with   each other for thousand years. [00:01:25]Until recently, their   monetary union had brought stability and prosperity to the   [00:01:30]continent's social democracies, producing good wages,   generous benefits, long [00:01:35]vacations. But Louise Cooper, a   top financial analyst in London, says the [00:01:40]European   holiday is over.  LOUISE COOPERWe're in a-- a debt crisis. [00:01:45]Euro   zone countries have way too much [00:01:50]debt. We have gorged   on debt. We are living beyond our means. And after ten   [00:01:55]years of booming economic times, and it's now payback   time. We are paying back [00:02:00]our credit cards and that will   prove very painful and costly.  STEVE KROFTIt [00:02:05]already has. Ten European   countries are now in recession. [00:02:10]   STEVE KROFTIn Spain, where the unemployment rate is   twenty-three percent, there have been general [00:02:15]strikes   and civil unrest. In France, three of its largest   [00:02:20]financial institutions teetered on the edge of   insolvency until the European Central Bank [00:02:25]came to the   rescue with more than a trillion dollars in easy credit to shore   up the system. [00:02:30]Seven European countries have changed   leadership because of the crisis; and [00:02:35]one, Greece,   reneged on a hundred and thirty-three billion dollars in   debts.  LOUISE COOPERThis is an [00:02:40]extraordinary event.   You know, a member of the euro club, the [00:02:45]elite euro   club, can't pay its bills. That is [00:02:50]extraordinary. A   Western, developed country has [00:02:55]defaulted. We haven't   seen that since 1940 when Italy did it in the Second World War   when it refused to pay its enemies.  STEVE KROFTThe financial [00:03:00]markets worry that   the same fate could befall [00:03:05]Ireland, Portugal, Spain and   Italy, which are already all in crisis, and losing the confidence   [00:03:10]of international investors who have bankrolled their   debts.  LOUISE COOPERThe fear of Greece [00:03:15]is it sets a   precedent for other indebted countries. Then everybody who owns   [00:03:20]Portuguese debt or Irish debt, possibly even Spanish   debt or Italian debt, you [00:03:25]start to worry, will I ever   get my money back? That is the problem.  STEVE KROFTEuropean [00:03:30]finance ministers have   spent most of the past year trying to find a way to save Greece   and keep [00:03:35]the euro zone intact. But until recently, they   have lacked the unity and the [00:03:40]authority to impose a   solution on seventeen different countries, all of which have   their [00:03:45]own financial and political interests. Christine   Lagarde, the managing [00:03:50]director of the International   Monetary Fund, has been part of the process.  CHRISTINE LAGARDEWhen you have [00:03:55]a single   currency and when you don't have a single or at least very   [00:04:00]closely coordinated fiscal policy then you run the risk   of having part [00:04:05]of the territory go into one direction   and other part of the territory [00:04:10]go into another   direction. And that's exactly what happened.  STEVE KROFTLagarde [00:04:15]says the divide exists   between Northern Europeans--the Germans, the Dutch and the   Finns--who are [00:04:20]industrious, prosperous and frugal; and   the Southern Europeans--the Greeks, the Portuguese [00:04:25]and   the Italians--who are much more relaxed about work, money, and   paying their taxes. [00:04:30]Lagarde says it didn't matter much   until 2008, when the global [00:04:35]financial crisis rolled in,   separating the savers from the spenders.  CHRISTINE LAGARDEYou know, it's [00:04:40]like when the   tide goes away, you see those that do not have their swimming   costume [00:04:45]on. And that was the case in Europe.  STEVE KROFTThe largest of the countries left totally   [00:04:50]naked was Greece. The nation of just [00:04:55]eleven   million people was a half a trillion dollars in debt and unable   to pay its bills, leaving Europe with a Lehman   Brothers-[00:05:00]like dilemma: either bail the Greeks out or   let them go broke, a [00:05:05]risky proposition that could   trigger another huge financial meltdown.  LOUISE COOPERI think the problem [00:05:10]is that   nobody quite knows what a messy Greek [00:05:15]default will do.   And what a country coming out of the [00:05:20]euro zone will do.   And if it's uncharted waters, then [00:05:25]that makes a lot of   people very nervous.  STEVE KROFTSo, they'd rather-- they'd [00:05:30]rather   fork over a hundred and thirty billion euros to keep the game   sort of alive--  LOUISE COOPERExactly. [00:05:35]   STEVE KROFT--rather than risk the downside of a   breakup?  LOUISE COOPERBecause we don't know what could happen,   how [00:05:40]messy, hideous, damaging it could be.  STEVE KROFTI mean, how powerful is Germany within the--   within the [00:05:45]E.U?  LOUISE COOPERGermany is the check writer.  STEVE KROFTWith its huge [00:05:50]industrial economy,   its vast trade surpluses and balanced budgets, Germany is by   [00:05:55]far the most powerful country in Europe. And it   reluctantly agreed to bailout [00:06:00]what it considered to be   its deadbeat relatives, but only up to a point, and   [00:06:05]only under certain conditions.  STEVE KROFTIn return for going along with the bailout,   [00:06:10]Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that all euro members   roll back their debt, [00:06:15]and that severe austerity   measures be imposed on Greece; requiring it to slash   [00:06:20]government spending, roll back pensions, lay off a   hundred and fifty thousand [00:06:25]public workers, reduce   salaries by twenty percent, and raise taxes. [00:06:30]All of   this imposed on a country that had been in recession for the past   five years. [00:06:35]   STEVE KROFTDescribe the situation in Greece to me right   now. What's going on?  YANIS VAROUFAKISGreece is in its [00:06:40]Great   Depression. Greece is in a coma. And it is getting deeper into   that coma as one company, [00:06:45]one firm, one [00:06:50]shop   shuts after the next.  STEVE KROFTYanis Varoufakis is an economist at the   [00:06:55]University of Athens who has advised the Greek   government. He says the belt-[00:07:00]tightening is stifling   economies all over Europe and made the situation in Greece much   [00:07:05]worse. The Greek unemployment rate now stands at   twenty-one percent, and the [00:07:10]economy is shrinking at the   rate of eight percent. There are [00:07:15]bread lines in Athens;   and in the central markets, more people are looking,   [00:07:20]than actually buying.  STEVE KROFTHow's your business? [00:07:25]   UNKNOWNVery difficult.  UNKNOWNSeventy percent [00:07:30]down. Right now   everything is very difficult and I don't think we've even started   to see the beginning of the [00:07:35]bad times. People don't   have the money to buy anything. The situation is very bad. [00:07:40]   STEVE KROFTThere's a feeling of hopelessness,   humiliation and anger in the country, as the [00:07:45]economy   continues to spiral downward.  STEVE KROFTMost people would say Greece got itself into   this by [00:07:50]borrowing way too much money, by being a fairly   unproductive society, by not [00:07:55]paying its taxes. All   those things are true.  YANIS VAROUFAKISAll those things [00:08:00]are precisely   true, but have no capacity to explain the [00:08:05]crisis that   Greece finds itself in today. All these things have always been   true, [00:08:10]but we haven't had a crisis like this. We are now   going through what the United States of [00:08:15]America went   between 1929 and 1932. Only, [00:08:20]we are part of a currency   union which was never designed to [00:08:25]sustain such a   crisis.  STEVE KROFTIn the past, if Greece found its accounts   overdrawn, the [00:08:30]country simply printed more money or   devalued its currency to accommodate the [00:08:35]relaxed Greek   lifestyle. That's no longer possible. With the drachma   [00:08:40]replaced by the euro, Greeks must now march to the tune   of German bankers. [00:08:45]And they have not shied away from   expressing their displeasure. [00:08:50]   STEVE KROFTOn February 12th, the day the Greek   parliament adopted the [00:08:55]new austerity measures, eighty   thousand people took to the streets to protest. [00:09:00]   STEVE KROFTBy nightfall, the [00:09:05]demonstrations   had turned violent, as rioters clashed with police and set fire   to buildings [00:09:10]causing tens of millions of dollars in   damage. It was, [00:09:15]in a crude way, an expression of Greek   nationalism that reignited old [00:09:20]resentments and   grievances that had been carefully managed for the past seventy   years, [00:09:25]and much of it was directed at Berlin.  LOUISE COOPERI mean, this is the trouble. When-- when   you get into [00:09:30]debt, you don't control your own destiny,   the creditors take over. And that's exactly what's happening in   Greece. [00:09:35]   STEVE KROFTDo the Greeks feel the Germans are trying to   run the country?  LOUISE COOPERYes.  STEVE KROFTAre they?  LOUISE COOPERAnd to a [00:09:40]certain extent they are.   And the sad-- sad thing for the [00:09:45]Greeks is they remember   the Second World War. Some of the [00:09:50]rhetoric harks back   to what Germany did in Greece in the Second World War. I mean,   that is [00:09:55]really quite terrifying that senior politicians   are talking about these things. [00:10:00]   STEVE KROFTIt was a long time ago and a different   Germany. But three hundred thousand [00:10:05]Greeks died of   starvation during the Nazi occupation, and that kind of history   [00:10:10]is not easily forgotten. So it did not sit well when   the German government [00:10:15]proposed sending a Kommissar to   Athens to oversee Greek finances. The German [00:10:20]finance   minister, Wolfang Schaeuble, even floated the idea of postponing   Greek [00:10:25]elections out of concern that a new government   might overturn the austerity agreement. [00:10:30]   YANIS VAROUFAKISYou cannot tell a people when they're   going to hold elections. You cannot [00:10:35]tell a sovereign   parliament when it should be dissolving itself or not. You can   express [00:10:40]a wish, but you cannot issue, especially if   you're speaking with a German accent, [00:10:45]to a people that   have suffered in a German occupation and an occupation   [00:10:50]that is still vivid in most people's memories, what to   do.  STEVE KROFTThe [00:10:55]acrimony has been very public,   with Greek newspapers depicting Chancellor Merkel and Finance   [00:11:00]Minister Schaeuble as Nazis. Schaeuble is the architect   of the fiscal [00:11:05]reforms in Greece.  STEVE KROFTThere's some bad feelings towards Germany in   Greece, as I'm [00:11:10]sure you're aware. What's your reaction   to that?  WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLEWell, it's always like [00:11:15]that,   you know. When you have countries or people who have been living   beyond their means, and now [00:11:20]they have to apply some   austerity, they have to make cuts, they have to reform their   labor market. [00:11:25]In such a situation, people tend to push   the blame to others. They are looking for [00:11:30]scapegoats.   It's perfectly normal. But at the same time, the Greek people   know that [00:11:35]their prosperity is thanks to Greece being   part of Europe.  STEVE KROFTI'm sure you've seen the cartoons.   [00:11:40]People talk about living under the German boot, they   blame [00:11:45]you. Not just Germany, but in many cases, you   personally. [00:11:50]   WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLEWell, of course. That's part of   politics. But it's my [00:11:55]job as German finance minister to   repeat over and over that we can't spend more than we   [00:12:00]have. But it doesn't mean that we want to dominate   anybody. Germany tried to do so in [00:12:05]the past, and it   never worked, but it no longer wants to do so today. [00:12:10]   STEVE KROFTThe next hurdle for Europe to clear in this   slow moving crisis is the upcoming [00:12:15]Greek parliamentary   elections, in which voters are threatening to roll back the   economic [00:12:20]reforms, an outcome that could result in a   full blown bankruptcy for Greece, [00:12:25]and a forced exit   from the euro. European leaders say they are confident that   [00:12:30]the worst is over. And so far they have managed to   avert a disaster. But there is [00:12:35]still general pessimism   in the financial markets with the economic stagnation   [00:12:40]spreading to Spain.  CHRISTINE LAGARDEThere's still medicine to be taken. And   that's what's happening in-- in [00:12:45]most of these southern   euro zone states at the moment, plus Ireland. [00:12:50]   STEVE KROFTWhat about the situation in Greece?  CHRISTINE LAGARDEThe situation in Greece [00:12:55]is--   is-- is a close call, let's put it that way.  LOUISE COOPERTo me when I look [00:13:00]at the euro,   it's a battle between economics ripping it apart and   [00:13:05]politics desperately trying to hold it together. And my   view is the economics [00:13:10]will always win out   eventually.  STEVE KROFTDo you think Greece is going to make it?  LOUISE COOPERNo. [00:13:15]   STEVE KROFTCould it drive the rest of the world back   into recession.  LOUISE COOPEROh, absolutely. You know, the euro area   is-- is a very [00:13:20]big part of the global economy.  STEVE KROFTWhat about the United States?  LOUISE COOPERWell, the U.S is-- is doing terribly   [00:13:25]well at the moment. However, clearly if the euro zone   [00:13:30]has a really bad time of it this year, which it could   well do, then [00:13:35]America will not escape unscathed. END TRANSCRIPT ",2012-04-08

158,1936991497.xml,"U.S.-armed fighters in a race with Syrian army for key areaBEIRUT -- U.S.-backed Syrian fighters launched an offensive against  the Islamic State group in eastern Syria along the border with Iraq  on Saturday, bringing them into a race with government forces  marching in the same direction against the extremists in their last  major holdout in the war-torn country.The battles for Deir el-Zour highlight the importance of the  oil-rich eastern province, which has become the latest epicenter of  the international war against the Islamic State, raising concerns  of an eventual clash between the two sides.The U.S.-trained Deir el-Zour Military Council said it was calling  its operation Jazeera Storm, after the familiar name for northeast  Syria. The Military Council is a part of the predominantly-Kurdish  Syrian Democratic Forces, which enjoys broad U.S. military support.  SDF are the U.S.'s primary ally in the fight against ISIS in Syria.The race to reach the Iraqi border will shape future regional  dynamics, determining whether the United States or Russia and Iran  will have more influence in the strategic area once ISIS is  defeated.Iran has been one of President Bashar Assad's strongest backers  since the crisis began in March 2011.The U.S.-backed fighters are up against a huge challenge to reach  Deir el-Zour, especially while they are still fighting to liberate  Raqqa from ISIS. Three months into the battle, they have liberated  around 60 percent of the city.Last week, Syrian troops and their Iranian-backed allies reached  Deir el-Zour, breaking a nearly three-year-old ISIS siege on  government-held parts of the city. In a victory statement, the  Syrian military said Deir el-Zour will be used as a launching pad  to liberate the remaining ISIS-held areas along the border with  Iraq.Italian officers suspended after alleged rape of 2 U.S. studentsROME -- Italy's Carabinieri paramilitary police corps has suspended  on a precautionary basis two policemen who allegedly raped two U.S.  students in Florence while on duty.The Carabinieri provincial office's stressed Saturday that the  suspension reflects alleged conduct while on duty and is separate  from Florence prosecutors' criminal investigation of the alleged  rapes. The women told authorities that the police, in uniform,  drove them home from a disco early Thursday morning because they  couldn't find a taxi, then raped them inside their apartment  building.Investigators are awaiting DNA test results to see if they confirm  the women's account.Besides the rape allegations, the policemen risk disciplinary  charges for driving the women home without informing their  superiors.Merkel fires back at hecklers ahead of election in GermanyBERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel and a senior aide on Saturday  criticized pro-nationalist protesters who have heckled Germany's  leader during campaign appearances ahead of the Sept. 24 national  election.Merkel's rallies over recent weeks have frequently been marked by  boos, whistles and other minor disruptions by groups of opponents.  Someone threw tomatoes at Merkel in Heidelberg on Tuesday and on  Friday, tomatoes were thrown at her car as she arrived in Wolgast  on the Baltic coast.The incidents come as the nationalist Alternative for Germany,  known by its German acronym AfD, seeks to enter parliament for the  first time. The four-year-old party is critical of Merkel's  decision to allow in large numbers of migrants in 2015.3,500-year-old pharaonic tomb discovered in Luxor, says EgyptLUXOR, Egypt -- Egypt on Saturday announced the discovery in the  southern city of Luxor of a pharaonic tomb belonging to a royal  goldsmith who lived more than 3,500 years ago and whose work was  dedicated to the ancient Egyptian god Amun.The tomb, on the west bank of the river Nile in a cemetery for  noblemen and top officials, is a relatively modest discovery, but  one that authorities have announced with a great deal of fanfare in  a bid to boost the country's slowly recovering tourism industry.Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Anani said the tomb was not in good  condition, but contained a partially damaged sandstone statue of  the goldsmith, named Amenemhat, and his wife. Between the couple  stands a smaller figure of one of their sons.Iraq softens ISIS-held town before ground attackBAGHDAD -- The Iraqi air force and the U.S.-led coalition have  stepped up a campaign of airstrikes on the Islamic State-held town  of Hawija ahead of a planned ground assault there, according to  Iraq's minister of defense.Also Saturday, the secretary general of the Arab League visited  Baghdad to encourage political dialogue with Irbil as Iraq's  Kurdish region pushes forward with plans to hold a referendum on  independence Sept. 25.Despite military operations to clear out the last pockets of  territory held by the group known as ISIS, the referendum has  increased tensions between the central government and the Kurdish  region.During the operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's military coordinated  attacks with Kurdish forces. Mosul was declared liberated in July  after a nine-month fight.Mich. mom who picked infant over chemo diesDETROIT -- A Michigan woman who sacrificed the chance to prolong  her life in order to give birth to her sixth child died early  Saturday, her husband said.Nick DeKlyen said his wife, Carrie DeKlyen, died surrounded by  family at University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. He said  among his last words to her were: ""I'll see you in Heaven.""Doctors removed Carrie DeKlyen's feeding and breathing tubes  Thursday, a day after she gave birth to her daughter Life Lynn  DeKlyen. The mother chose to forgo chemotherapy to treat her brain  cancer, since it would have meant ending her pregnancy.Life Lynn was born at 24 weeks and five days into the pregnancy and  weighed 1 pound, 4 ounces. The couple have five other children who  range in age from 2 to 18. Eric Chase Bolling, the son of former Fox News host Eric Bolling,  died Friday night, just hours after the network announced that the  elder Bolling was leaving the network. Bolling was a freshman at  the University of Colorado in Boulder. Authorities say there was  ""no sign of self harm,"" the father said. Police in New York City arrested Ashley Sharpton, the youngest  daughter of the Rev. Al Sharpton, early Saturday after a taxi  driver accused her of snatching his car keys out of the ignition  and tossing them. Police said Sharpton, 30, was released on an  appearance ticket after her arrest on charges including petit  larceny.\CAPTION: Photo: Children wait for the pope's arrival on a rainy Saturday in  Medellin, Colombia.

159,1918799396.xml,"President Donald Trump on Thursday again defended the decision by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to meet with a Russian lawyer to get derogatory information about Hillary Clinton during last year's presidential campaign, saying that ""most people would have taken that meeting."" Separately, Trump also said he would personally decide the future of the Obama administration program that shields from deportation some 750,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. His statement appeared to close off the possibility, touted by some officials, that subordinates could kill off the program without Trump's direct involvement.The developments came during a hastily planned visit to Paris in which Emmanuel Macron, the recently elected French president, assiduously wooed Trump with pomp, pageantry and a playing down of issues on which he disagrees with the American leader he called ""dear Donald,"" notably climate change.The French president's warm embrace of Trump came as a welcome change for a White House that has been beleaguered of late, most recently because of Trump Jr.'s release of emails surrounding his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.The emails showed that the friend of Trump Jr.'s who arranged the meeting had described Veselnitskaya to him as a ""Russian government attorney"" who had ""official documents and information"" that would ""incriminate"" Clinton and ""be very useful to your father.""Her information was ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,"" the emails said.The emails were the most concrete evidence to date that senior officials in Trump's campaign had knowledge of Russian efforts to interfere in the election. His son went to the meeting with Veselnitskaya along with Trump's campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top adviser to the president.U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a wide-ranging effort to sway the election in Trump's favor. That effort, and any evidence that people close to Trump potentially collaborated in it, forms the center of a criminal investigation headed by a special counsel, Robert Mueller.Trump's nominee to head the FBI, Christopher Wray, said Wednesday during his confirmation hearing that any person offered information from a foreign entity about a political opponent should call the FBI.Asked about that at a news conference with Macron, Trump praised Wray but asserted that his son had done nothing wrong. Obtaining what he referred to as ""opposition research"" is ""very standard in politics,"" Trump said.In the news conference, Trump twice referred to his son as a ""young man"" -- at 39, he is 10 days younger than the French president -- and insisted that ""nothing happened from the meeting, zero happened.""""The press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do,"" he said.Political operatives in both parties have disputed that, saying that taking information from a foreign government to use in a political campaign would be highly unusual.Doing so may also violate federal law, which prohibits campaigns from taking anything of value from foreigners.The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said Thursday that the panel was seeking to have Trump Jr. appear soon at a public hearing.Officials from foreign countries have sometimes passed information to groups affiliated with the American political parties. Some Ukrainian officials, for example, shared information with Democratic operatives last year about the Trump campaign manager, Manafort. Typically those countries are U.S. allies rather than adversaries like Russia.Trump, apparently referencing an article in The Hill newspaper that said the Justice Department had enabled the attorney to be in the country, suggested Thursday ""she was here"" because of former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.An assistant United States attorney in a January court hearing in New York said the federal government had bypassed the normal visa process and granted a ""type of extraordinary permission"" so that her client could be in the U.S. to be deposed in a Justice Department lawsuit involving a Russian investment firm. The government, the assistant attorney said, ""made the further accommodation of allowing his Russian lawyer into the country to assist.""In a statement, Lynch said she had no knowledge of Veselnitskaya's travel. ""The State Department issues visas, and the Department of Homeland Security oversees entry to the United States at airports,"" the statement said.The news conference was the main public event in a presidential visit to Paris that included much of the pomp and showmanship that Trump is said to delight in, all part of what appeared to be a determined effort by Macron to forge a bond with the U.S. president.Both presidents appeared intent on conveying a picture of harmony. Macron at one point broke into English to respond to a question about Trump's relationship with Putin, saying that ""it's important that both of us have direct discussions and contact"" with the Russian leader.And Trump, asked about remarks he made earlier this year in which he said Paris was unsafe because France's softness on immigration left it vulnerable to terrorism, said that the situation had changed with Macron's election.""You have a great president,"" he said, ""a tough president,"" who is ""not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws.""""You're going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris,"" Trump said, adding that he planned to return.The news conference came after Trump and Macron met for about an hour at the presidential palace. The two discussed trade, the wars in Syria and Iraq and fighting terrorism, Macron said. They agreed to put new pressure on Internet companies to restrict propaganda by Islamic State and other extremist groups, he said.The two also talked about their disagreement over global warming, on which Macron played down earlier criticism of Trump.Last month, Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate, which President Barack Obama helped negotiate in 2015 among nearly 200 countries. Macron and other European leaders strongly opposed Trump's decision.Asked about the issue, Macron, speaking through an interpreter, said that the two leaders ""have a number of disagreements"" but that he understood Trump's desire to fulfill his campaign pledge to withdraw from the agreement and ""to save jobs.""Disagreements on that one issue should ""absolutely not"" block the U.S. and France from pursuing other topics, he said.Trump's positions on trade, climate change and immigration have made him deeply unpopular in much of Europe -- the White House, for example, has scrapped plans for the president to visit Britain this year, in part because of concerns about street protests.The president has had notably tense relations with several European leaders, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But Macron appears to have decided to try to establish a closer connection, despite Trump's fairly open preference during this year's French election for his opponent, Marine Le Pen, the right-wing nationalist.----------Brian Bennett reported from Paris and David Lauter from Washington.brian.bennett@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: President Donald Trump is welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron during a welcome ceremony at Les Invalides in Paris on Thursday.

160,356631495.xml,"      Read newspaper opinion pages and political Web sites and you can't miss the harsh verdict of many U.S. conservatives: They see Barack Obama as an appeaser, a timid president who needs to more forcefully align his government with the protesters now under bloody siege in Iran. Writing in Monday's Tribune, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer lacerated Obama for dithering as Iran's theocratic dictatorship crushes expressions of liberty: ""The demonstrators are fighting on their own, but they await just a word that America is on their side. ... And where is our president? Afraid of 'meddling.' Afraid to take sides between the head-breaking, women-shackling exporters of terror -- and the people in the street yearning to breathe free."" It's true that Obama has been more measured in tone and rhetoric than some Western leaders, such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But as all children need to learn, just because you're noisy doesn't mean you're influential. We share -- and repeatedly have endorsed on this page -- the conservatives' commitment to the spread of liberal democracies worldwide. But in this instance, we think Obama is playing it shrewd. Why so? What's at play in Iran is a violent confrontation between a government and its people -- the sort of crackdown that, in the eyes of the world, usually marks the government as the loser. The mullahs know this. They'd love to turn this internal uprising into an international dispute between their government and the Great Satan, the government in Washington. It doesn't help that the U.S. has interfered in Iran before. Many Iranians bitterly recall that a CIA-led coup toppled their government in 1953, bringing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a U.S. ally, to power. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is already railing against the U.S. and Britain as hostile foreign powers meddling in Iran's internal affairs. He'd like nothing better than for a more vocal Obama to prove his point. It's not as if Obama has been silent. His Saturday statement, issued as police wielded batons and tear gas against election protesters, was a deftly calculated balance of American principles and realities in Tehran: ""The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching. We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people. The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights."" Those are not bellicose words. But they do affirm what the world already knows: To the extent that it can speak, the Obama administration -- and, more to the point, the American people -- support those courageous protesters as they take risks that could end their futures if not their lives. A mouthier approach from Washington wouldn't advance their goals. Or ours.  ",2009-06-23
161,1041134572.xml,"       I had heard about U.S. political polarization before I landed here. I read about poisoned political landscapes, two parties competing every day in a kind of political mud-wrestling contest, deep racial divisions. After my arrival, it was obvious I had basically read the truth.   And you know what? I feel a little ashamed because I enjoy the fighting, the debates and the oddities, like an old man standing on a stage talking to a chair. For me, this is a huge dose of political stimulant.   Why? Because I'm tired of politics without fighting, without real differences in content, without tough scuffles from time to time. I've had an overdose of harmony. I'm from Germany.   It all began in 2005. The two major parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, built a grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel, who remains in office. Natural opponents since the founding of the West German Federal Republic in 1949, the two parties had to come together to keep things going. And from that point on, the differences between the former opponents began to vanish. Politics became boring.   What happens if opponents are forced to cooperate? They work only on the things they agree upon, which naturally are not too many. All the other stuff isn't even discussed, at least not publicly. It may feel peaceful for a while, but it becomes harmful to robust political culture -- although there still are lots of Germans who consider the coalition's work to be great and very useful for the country.   These people clearly don't understand how important fighting is for democracy.   Consider Germany's 2009 federal election. Merkel's conservative party was projected to form a new center-right government by ending its kumbaya relationship with the Social Democratic Party. The SPD then had to figure out how to attack Merkel after four years of acting in harmony with her party.   And what did Merkel do? Nothing.   She didn't want to give the Social Democrats a target to attack. Merkel didn't want to give potential center-left voters a reason to show up at the polls at the last minute, motivated by a controversial debate or a symbolically charged issue. And it helped that her opponent, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a smart, skilled, pleasant candidate, was as exciting as a blank piece of paper.   Merkel won with a voter turnout of 70.8 percent, compared with 77.7 percent four years earlier. It was the lowest turnout since the founding of the republic. Merkel had lulled the voters.   And it's still going on. The most controversial issue in Germany today is the eurozone crisis.   Though they've opposed the eurozone since 2009, Social Democrats nevertheless support Merkel's bailout decision, declaring it would be irresponsible to take political advantage of the crisis.   The result is that there has been no fundamental debate between the two parties about how to deal with this crisis. This is dangerous.   Politicians should discuss game-changing issues as extensively as possible.   That's why I enjoy the U.S. presidential race so much.   It may be flashy, sometimes filthy, sometimes brutal, and for sure it is a problem that money plays such an important role in its orchestration. But there are real differences about how to secure the future of this country. U.S. voters have a real choice.   ----------  Christoph Hickmann, a political reporter in the Berlin bureau of German national daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, is currently with the Chicago Tribune as an Arthur F. Burns fellow. Caption: Photos: Angela Merkel became chancellor of Germany in a 2005 coalition-building effort, and the lack of opposition to her leadership has made politics boring.

162,1848435779.xml,"       In the murky world of intelligence, it isn't often that anyone has  crystal clear, absolutely certain, 100 percent guaranteed advance  knowledge of a forthcoming operation. But in Europe now, there is  one prediction that everyone is happy to make: In 2017, the Russian  government will mount an open campaign to sway the German  elections. We know the Russians can do it. The CIA has confirmed that Russian  cyberhackers procured material from Hillary Clinton's campaign that  appeared, via WikiLeaks, at key moments in the U.S. presidential  race. Hacked emails became part of a successful trolling campaign  to discredit Clinton (and continue to inspire hysteria in the form  of Pizzagate, the bizarre conspiracy theory that just won't die).  During the campaign, Trump frequently repeated lines lifted from  Russian propaganda, including threats that Obama ""founded ISIS,""  also known as the Islamic State, and Clinton would ""cause World War  III.""   Similar campaigns involving hacks, violent rallies and dark  conspiracy theories have worked in other countries, including  Georgia, Poland and Ukraine. Risky on the face of it, the U.S.  operation did no harm to Russia's interests. On the contrary, the  pro-Russian candidate won. Business looks set to continue as usual.   Earlier this month, the head of the German domestic intelligence  agency said that material hacked from the German Parliament,  published recently by WikiLeaks, came from the same Russian group  that stole material from the Democratic National Committee. He  believes ""increased cyber spying and cyber operations"" are  underway. The head of Germany's foreign intelligence service has  identified a rise in cyberattacks designed not to steal defense or  commercial information but rather ""to elicit political  uncertainty.""   Not that hacking is the only tactic. Earlier this year, Russian  media and pro-Russian trolls helped create online hysteria by  promoting a fake story of a Russian girl allegedly raped by a  Syrian immigrant. Russia also has offered financial and moral  support to Germany's far-right and far-left parties, just as it  does elsewhere in Europe.   There may well be a specific goal: defeat Chancellor Angela Merkel,  who responded to Russia's annexation of Crimea with support for  sanctions that are particularly hurtful to Russian President  Vladimir Putin's inner circle. But there are certainly some broader  goals: discredit democracy, in order to prevent Russians from  agitating for it at home; undermine the European Union, in order to  make the continent more amenable to corruption and  authoritarianism; and demoralize NATO, which is preventing Russia  from flexing its military muscles in its periphery.   We know that huge resources have been invested already. In the past  decade, Russia has funneled many millions of dollars into its  public propaganda arms, the television channel RT and the website  Sputnik, which now exist in multiple languages, including German.  Less visibly, Russia has invested an equivalent sum in friends:  think tanks, businessmen, even politicians. Matthias Warnig, an  ex-Stasi officer who knew Putin in his KGB days, is managing  director of Nord Stream AG, the company that operates the gas  pipeline that links Germany and Russia beneath the Baltic Sea.  Gerhard Schroeder, the former German chancellor, is now the  chairman of the shareholders' committee of that same company.   We also know -- or should know -- why they could succeed. Long  before anyone else, the Russian government spotted deep flaws in  Western democracy. It realized that Western politicians could be  bribed; that offshoring worked in oligarchs' favor; that  anti-corruption laws weren't well enforced; that Western media was  weak; and that social media had undermined trust in traditional  sources of authority. Russian leaders also understood that, thanks  to the global reach of the Internet, disinformation was far easier  to produce and promote than ever before.   Merkel has made serious mistakes. However well meant, her  unilateral offer to house Syrian refugees in summer 2015 gave  millions across the continent the impression that Europe no longer  controls its borders. Terrorist attacks increased this anxiety.  Germany has failed to back European solutions to crises in the  Middle East, failed to take seriously the need for European  defense, failed to invest in NATO. The bill for all of those  failures is now coming due.   In coming months, Russian media, and Russian-backed parties in  Germany, will have no compunction about openly running an  anti-immigrant, anti-American, anti-E.U. electoral campaign. They  may have an unexpected ally: Breitbart, the far-right website run  until recently by Stephen Bannon, incoming White House chief  strategist for the Trump administration, has announced it will  invest in a German-language website, too.   As a state, and as a democracy, Germany has huge advantages.  Economic success means Germans still trust their government more  than many other Europeans. The relative strength of German media  means the horrible insult, lugenpresse -- lying press -- once used  by the Nazis to smear mainstream media and now used by the far-left  and far-right for the same purpose, doesn't affect everyone.   German security officials say they already meet regularly with  senior journalists, briefing them on stories they think are fake.  Merkel and other German politicians have spoken openly of the  threat. But is the anticipation of a disinformation campaign enough  to rob it of its power? We are about to find out.   ----------  Washington Post   Anne Applebaum writes a biweekly foreign affairs column for The  Washington Post.

163,420351294.xml,"         Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl broke his right arm in a fall at his house in Ludwigshafen, his office said Monday.    The 75-year-old Kohl, who fell Sunday morning, canceled a planned reading of parts of his memoirs Monday in Mannheim. It was unclear whether he would cancel any more appointments in the coming days, his office said.    Kohl, a member of the Christian Democratic Union, was chancellor of Germany from 1982-98. His successor, Gerhard Schroeder, was defeated in September by Angela Merkel, who took office as the country's first female chancellor Nov. 22.    Kohl's second volume of memoirs, ""Helmut Kohl, Memories 1982- 1990,"" covers his election in 1982 through the reunification of East and West Germany.    A third volume is in the works.  ",2005-11-29
164,1966356105.xml,"The sudden collapse of talks to form a coalition government left German politics in turmoil Monday, as Chancellor Angela Merkel reckoned with one of the worst crises of her 12-year tenure and signaled that a new election is likely.  The unexpected failure triggered a flurry of activity in the normally predictable world of German politics, putting financial markets on edge, setting off speculation over a new election and upping the volume on previously whispered conversations about how much longer Merkel can last.Following a midday meeting with the chancellor, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier attempted to calm the choppy waters with a speech in which he called on parties to come back to the negotiating table and avoid another vote after an inconclusive September election.""The responsibility given to the parties remains,"" said Steinmeier, noting that Monday's impasse was unprecedented in Germany's post-war history. ""One can't just return that responsibility to the voters.""But despite his plea, a fresh vote looked increasingly likely -- a fact that Merkel herself acknowledged Monday evening in an interview with broadcaster ZDF.While Merkel insisted she would not step down, she also suggested that calling a new election would be preferable to leading a government that must survive vote-to-vote without a majority in the German parliament, the Bundestag.""Germany needs a stable government,"" she said.Her comments indicated that without a change of heart from the center-left Social Democrats, who have resisted joining a new coalition, Germany is probably headed for a new election.The possibility was met with enthusiasm by the German far right and with apprehension across Europe, where German stability has long been taken for granted.""After Brexit and Trump, Germans are now facing the prospect of something out of the ordinary happening in their own country,"" said Sudha David-Wilp, deputy director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund. ""Something that was beyond their borders is a spectacle that they will now have to deal with, too.""The breakdown of the talks ends the assumption that Europe's largest economy will be governed by a previously untried coalition among Merkel's conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens.That awkward alliance -- dubbed the ""Jamaica coalition"" because the parties' colors are the same as the island nation's flag -- was considered the only viable path to a stable government.But after weeks of contentious negotiations over asylum, tax and environmental policies, the Free Democrats unexpectedly pulled out late Sunday, leaving Merkel with few options, none of them attractive.One is to form a minority government, perhaps with the Greens. But that has never been attempted at the federal level in Germany, and it could prolong the country's instability while hastening Merkel's exit.Another is for Merkel to persuade her partners from the last government, the Social Democrats, to join her in another ""grand coalition"" between Germany's two biggest parties.But the Social Democrats continued to resist that idea Monday. The party ""will not shy away from new elections,"" Social Democratic leader Martin Schulz said. ""In fact, we welcome them.""The possibility of an election early next year that could open the way to more gains for the far-right Alternative for Democracy Party, or AfD -- and further unsettle the politics of a country that has been Europe's rock of stability -- sent the euro sliding in early trading before it rebounded.AfD leaders on Monday celebrated the breakdown in the talks. ""Merkel failed,"" tweeted prominent AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch. ""An AfD success!""CAPTION: Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel talks Monday with Alexander Dobrindt, left, of the Christian Social Union.

165,420679227.xml,"      ""[M]y country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO's first mission beyond Europe's borders is a success. ... America cannot do this alone. The Afghan people need our troops and your troops; our support and your support to defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda, to develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation. We have too much at stake to turn back now."" Barack Obama, speaking in Berlin On Thursday the Democrat who would be president spoke crucial words about Afghanistan. We only wish he'd spoken more of them. Germany, comfortable in its anti-militarism and questionable in its resolve to thwart global terror groups, embodies NATO's reluctance to do what's needed to win the Afghan war. Obama's extended photo op in Europe may hearten residents of that continent who view 21st Century America as too belligerent, just as it could enhance his candidacy for the presidency here at home. We hope, though, that the throng gathered before Obama in Berlin didn't hear only what it wanted to -- lots of talk about taking down walls -- and ignore his call for NATO members to take more responsibility for saving Afghanistan. In 2006, NATO forces took command of what had started five years earlier as a U.S. war effort. For the most part, though, Europe hasn't committed resources sufficient to prevail in Afghanistan. Rather than look eastward toward the war zone and ask -- ""What can we do?"" -- too many European leaders essentially have looked westward toward Washington, chanting, ""Yes, you can!"" The crowd in Berlin, like all the peoples of Europe, needs to appreciate the unanimity of commitment in this country. President Barack Obama or President John McCain won't shy from the message President  Bush has emphasized: The ""Don't-bother-us"" contingent in NATO must do more to exterminate terror groups in some of the most treacherous terrain on Earth. This isn't a new theme. Several European governments chafe at devoting more money to defense -- let alone deploying their soldiers to Afghanistan's most dangerous realms. Some nations send troops but restrict where and how they'll operate. This may be how poseurs pretend they're behaving dutifully. It is no way to win a war. Obama's Berlin speech, short on specifics, should have repeated Defense Secretary Robert Gates' blunt warning that NATO risks devolving into a two-tier partnership, with ""some allies willing to fight and die to protect people's security, and others who are not."" We haven't arrived at the point where NATO's existence is on the bubble. But that point isn't far over the horizon. If NATO is to have any meaning, an attack on one member has to be treated as an attack on all of them. If European nations won't step up when we're attacked -- as we were on Sept. 11, 2001 -- Americans will ask why they should step up if some country in Europe is attacked. The threat of Afghanistan returning to uniform lawlessness is palpable, and the demands European nations need to meet are not extreme. This is a sprawling and vicious war, but not a huge one. If NATO members dodge their obligations in Afghanistan, how reliable would they be as co-combatants in a more expansive conflict elsewhere -- perhaps one with nuclear implications? We welcome Euro interest in our election. But Kabul and Kandahar are that-a-way. Caption: Photo: Sen. Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met on Thursday in Berlin.

166,1695731895.xml,"       As America stumbles its way through the early stages of Donald Trump's unlikely and uncomfortable bid for the presidency, some here are wondering what exactly Trump says about the nation. ""Do other national cultures create men like Donald Trump?"" Atlantic writer Jeffrey Goldberg asked on Twitter. ""Asking for the United States."" Goldberg probably asked that question in jest, but there may be real concern behind it.   To many, Trump's political career seems to combine three ugly undercurrents of U.S. politics: the outsize role of money, the never-ending campaign season and America's embrace of reactionary celebrity figures.   So do other countries really have their own Donald Trumps? Well, yes, of course they do. When Goldberg asked his question, there was a flood of responses from foreign readers, who pointed to their own rich and rude political figures. Some comparisons don't quite seem fair (you may dislike Dominique Strauss-Kahn or Nigel Farage, but their faults and virtues are different from Trump's), while many, many other suggestions did seem apt.   Trump is a product of American society, but he's not unique. His mixture of murky wealth, extreme arrogance and vulgar chauvinism can be found all over the world, albeit with local spins. Here are just a handful of the world's other Donald Trumps.  Silvio Berlusconi   One of the best-known examples of a foreign Trump might be Silvio Berlusconi, the business magnate who was Italy's prime minister for about nine years in total.   Berlusconi, like Trump, espoused an entrepreneurial spirit but soon became better known for his misdemeanors and odd behavior: One time, he hid behind a monument and jumped out to scare German leader Angela Merkel, shouting, ""Coo-coo"" (""She enjoyed it,"" Berlusconi later said). Like Trump, he even has an intriguing hairstyle.   Is Berlusconi a true Trump? Perhaps, but there are certainly a number of important differences. Berlusconi was a real world leader for a considerable amount of time, and he does appear to have on limited occasions displayed the grace and gravitas that comes from that position. ""I met Berlusconi once,"" Goldberg tweeted when someone suggested him. ""He didn't seem quite so ridiculous. Ridiculous, but not at that level.""   Berlusconi's fall from grace was worsened by the pressures created by allegations of corruption and sexual misdeeds during his notorious ""bunga bunga"" parties: These factors have led him to face a number of charges after leaving office in 2011. Trump's business dealings may be murky, but they appear to fall short of outright corruption and it seems he gets more pleasure from outraging sections of the American public than he does from any sordid soirees.  Clive Palmer   Clive Palmer, an Australian billionaire, certainly creates Trump-size headlines. He has plans to construct a replica of the Titanic. He wants to open his own ""Jurassic Park."" He has accused his political opponents of being funded by the CIA. He has called Chinese officials ""mongrels"" (and later apologized).   The similarities between the two go beyond headlines and money, however. For years, Palmer has been accused of using his wealth to influence politics in Australia. In 2013, he established a political party and became a member of Parliament.   Some in Australia wonder whether Trump is following Palmer's playbook, but there are also differences between the two: Palmer seems genuinely intent on gaining political power, not just attention.   ""Imagine if Donald Trump had his own party, and that party controlled the balance of power in the Senate,"" is how one Australian academic summed it up last year.  Chen Guangbiao   China is a country full of very rich people, and often these very rich people have deep political ambitions. However, it's possible that Chen Guangbiao is the only one who can match Trump for sheer arrogance.   There are numerous examples of how big Chen's ego is, including his audacious and doomed attempt to buy The New York Times and his insistence on singing at media events.   Despite his Trump-like qualities, Chen is a very much a product of the modern Chinese world. He made his fortune in the recycling business, and his high profile comes from a combination of his charitable endeavors and his ultranationalist foreign policy messages.   While not a politician, Chen appears to be intertwined with the government, which is said to have issued decrees to state media banning negative coverage about him.  Vladimir Zhirinovsky   While Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the loud-mouthed Russian politician who founded the Liberal Democratic Party in 1990, may lack the business credentials of Trump (his background is in the military), he has a habit of making statements that suggest a kinship with the American businessman.   For example, he suggests arming every single person in Russia so they can kill birds. He threatened to carpet-bomb Poland and the Baltic states.   He rode a donkey in an infamous 2012 election video. In fact, he has probably gone further than even Trump would: A few years ago, he punched a political rival in the face after a televised election debate.   Despite his antics, Zhirinovsky is a political force in Russia. His ill-named political party, actually a far-right populist entity, gained 11 percent of the vote in the 2011 Duma election.   It seems that Zhirinovsky is a product of the chaos of the post-communist period in Russia.   As The New York Times wrote in 1994: ""Mr. Zhirinovsky can be racist, cruel, endlessly strident. But he knows how to draw a crowd and how to hold it.""  Tomio Okamura   In many parts of Central and Eastern Europe, business success and political populism mingle, creating fertile grounds for local variants of Trumps.   The Czech Republic's Tomio Okamura seems especially appropriate for this list, however.   Like Trump, he has not only parlayed entrepreneurial success into a spot on a reality television show, he has also been able to gain political momentum and a seat in the Czech senate. At one point, polls suggested that he was the third most popular politician in the country.   The similarities go further, however. Like Trump, Okamura has espoused anti-immigrant views: He recently told Czechs that they should walk pigs near mosques and suggested sending the Roma to India.   And, like Trump, he comes from an immigrant background. Trump's mother is Scottish; Okamura was born in Tokyo to a Japanese-Korean father and a Czech mother.   ----------  Washington Post   Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

168,1612861706.xml,"       A defiant Russian President Vladimir Putin joined Asian and  European leaders in Italy on Thursday for talks intended to focus  on trade but, like many diplomatic gatherings of the past six  months, the session was dominated by the deadly crisis in Ukraine. Putin was put on notice before the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting in  Milan that he would be pressed to genuinely conform to a Sept. 5  cease-fire that calls for an end to the armed conflict in eastern  Ukraine.  Despite the agreement signed six weeks ago by Russia, Ukraine and  pro-Russia separatists who have seized key industrial areas along  the Russian border, artillery exchanges have continued and hundreds  of fighters and civilians have died, boosting the death toll in  half a year of undeclared war to nearly 4,000.  The 53 nations of the Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, represent 60  percent of the world's population and more than half of its  economic activity. While the annual gathering has seldom produced  major agreements or diplomatic breakthroughs, it is seen this year  as an opportunity to bring pressure to bear on Putin to use his  influence with the separatists to end the Ukraine bloodshed.  Putin, however, joined the summit after a brash warning to Western  leaders that sanctions and accusations won't lead to peace.  President Barack Obama's depiction of Putin during a U.N. speech  last month as one of three ""major threats to humanity"" along with  the Ebola epidemic and Islamic State extremists spurred an ominous  retort from the Russian leader.  ""We hope that our partners will realize the futility of attempts to  blackmail Russia and remember what consequences discord between  major nuclear powers could bring for strategic stability,"" Putin  told Serbia's Politika newspaper. It was the second time in as many  months that Putin reminded Ukraine's Western allies of Russia's  nuclear capabilities.  He called Obama's posture toward Russia ""nothing but hostile,"" and  warned that moves to isolate Russia over its role in the Ukraine  violence were ""an absurd and illusory goal.""  Putin has repeatedly denied that Russia has a hand in the fighting.  However, separatist leaders have conceded they are supported by  Russia and that much of the military operation has been directed by  Russian special forces veterans and mercenaries. NATO, the Western  military alliance, has also released satellite images of Russian  armored vehicles crossing the border.  Putin announced this week that 17,600 Russian troops deployed along  Ukraine's border, ostensibly for maneuvers, had been ordered back  to their bases. But NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S.  Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, said Wednesday that the alliance  had not seen a significant Russian withdrawal.  Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko have a breakfast  meeting in Milan scheduled for Friday, their first face-to-face  discussion since meeting at D-Day ceremonies in France on June 6.  The two also shook hands in an icy encounter in Minsk, Belarus,  where the cease-fire was signed six weeks ago.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled at the start of the ASEM  summit that she expected Putin to show convincing steps toward  making the Sept. 5 cease fire ""a reality.""  Merkel listed three demands she intended to make of the Kremlin  leader at a meeting late Thursday: pull back all Russian troops  from Ukraine's border, allow the border to be secured and monitored  by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and  allow Ukraine's Oct. 26 elections for a new parliament to take  place on all Ukrainian territory.  The German leader has also said Russia must relinquish the Crimean  region seized from Ukraine earlier this year and annexed to Russia.  Putin, in his interview with Politika, repeated his position that  ethnic Russians in Ukraine were threatened by a resurgence of  neo-fascism after Kremlin-allied President Viktor Yanukovych was  deposed in February.  Putin has vehemently fought against Ukraine's pursuit of membership  in the European Union and NATO. While both Kiev and Brussels  officials have conceded that joining the Western military bloc  isn't a desired development for the near-term future, Kiev has  entered into a trade agreement with the 28-nation EU.  ---------- cwilliams2@tribune.com Credit: By Carol J.

169,2184025004.xml,"With tensions over Syria defused, at least for the moment, calm has  returned to the stock market as well as to individuals worried  about military engagement and the price of gasoline.  But analysts are warning investors not to become too comfortable.  Even before President Barack Obama (the spelling of the first name as published has been corrected in this text) began talking about a military  attack on Syria, analysts were preparing investors for ominous  dates on political calendars for both the U.S. and Europe this  fall. Independent of geopolitical issues in the Mideast, political  decisions later this month and next have the potential of  unsettling stock and bond markets.At issue in the U.S. is the possible replay of the nation's debt  ceiling debate. The country once again is approaching the point  where Congress must decide if it will lift restrictions on the  federal government's level of debt so the nation can pay its bills.  The expectation is that the deadline will arrive at the end of  October.In addition, there's the possibility of a partial government  shutdown if lawmakers don't extend the nation's authority to spend  after the old authority expires Sept. 30.In 2011, the fight over extending the debt ceiling became so  contentious that the stock market plunged as American politicians  seemed incapable of making decisions and Standard & Poor's lowered  the nation's credit rating. Political paralysis in Washington hit  at the same time the eurozone appeared poised for collapse -- a  nasty combination that shook confidence as businesses and consumers  looked for leadership strength amid global financial weakness.Analysts expect bitter fighting in Washington to erupt again as the  debt debate approaches deadlines. Yet, analysts also assume --  based on last-minute deals over the nation's debt during the last  two years -- that ultimately a deal will be forged, the federal  government will avoid a shutdown and the nation's debts will be  paid without sending a chill through the bond market.Although the posturing in the debate could cause a stock market  downturn temporarily, analysts expect the impact to be short-lived.Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent report to  clients that markets might not respond to the debate at first  because investors have been ""somewhat desensitized"" by bickering  and last-minute decisions in the past. But close to the deadline,  there could be ""short-lived volatility"" that would end with an  agreement.In the months ahead, the political scene in Europe could have more  of a long-term impact on the global economy and markets. There,  Italy's leadership is in flux and the kingpin of the eurozone,  Germany, faces an election Sept. 22. Since the dark days of 2011  and 2012, optimism about Europe's future has lifted primarily  because the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi,  promised to do whatever it takes to keep the euro intact. Recently,  some economic data has also shown signs that Europe is emerging  from recession.Still, some European banks and Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy  are still in distress. Germany, with a strong economy, has been the  key to bailouts up to this point and will be in the future.The most powerful person in those decisions, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel, is up for election. The popular notion has been that  once Merkel's election is behind her, she will no longer need to  worry about infuriating voters by helping countries on Europe's  periphery.With that freedom she presumably will become more lenient about  demanding weak countries adopt austerity measures and will be more  generous with bailouts -- paving the way for a European recovery.For example, David Kotok, chairman of Cumberland Advisors, which  manages more than $2.3 billion, recently wrote clients: ""The  European Central Bank (ECB) is destined to be expansive as soon as  it gets through the uncertainty occasioned by the German federal  election on September 22 and the German Constitutional Court ruling  on the ECB's bond-buying program.""That widespread belief, along with some stronger data on Europe's  distressed economy, has helped propel the European Stoxx 600 index  up almost 11 percent this year.While most analysts think Merkel is bound to win the election, some  claim there are no assurances the troubled parts of Europe will get  what they want as 17 nations grapple with unpopular assistance for  other countries.""Germany must lend, give and spend with abandon to save the euro,""  Lombard Street Research economist Brian Reading said in a recent  note. He thinks International Monetary Fund forecasts of the costs  and the ability of heavily indebted European countries to grow  their way out of trouble are wildly optimistic.Most analysts, he said, ""have lost sight of the debt-trap  arithmetic."" And without extraordinary help from Germany, he  expects the ""euro is in a hospice.""While an unexpected loss for Merkel in the election would rattle  investors, Europe's longer-term problems will not be immediately  apparent.Citigroup global political economist Tina Fordham said that  regardless of the German election this month, ""investors should not  expect significant changes to Berlin's austerity policy"" as public  support for national leaders is weak.""Governance challenges may lie ahead for the eurozone for some  years to come,"" she said.----------gmarksjarvis@tribune.comTwitter @gailmarksjarvis  <CAPTION: Graphic: CBOE Volatility Index\

170,1958169188.xml,"Failing at home, Catalan leader takes fight to Belgian capitalBRUSSELS -- Facing possible criminal charges at home that could put him behind bars for decades, ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont took his bid for independence from Spain to the heart of Europe on Tuesday, attempting to portray his secessionist movement as persecuted underdogs who deserve international backing in their fight against Madrid.A Spanish judge, meanwhile, ordered Puigdemont and the rest of his ousted Cabinet to appear for questioning this week as part of a rebellion probe. Whether they appear or not, the judge is likely to decide as soon as Friday on whether to issue arrest warrants.In a high-profile appearance before international media in the Belgian capital, Puigdemont kept up his defiant tone against the Spanish government's relentless efforts to thwart his secession ambitions. His unannounced trip underscored that his path to success is being blocked by the law in Spain, and he conceded ground to the Spanish government by agreeing to take part in an early regional election called for Dec. 21.Even as Puigdemont's quest to establish a new Western European country appeared increasingly quixotic, his grass-roots supporters showed no signs of wavering -- a depth of passion that illustrates why wrangling over Catalonia has been going on for so long and is unlikely to end soon.Puigdemont said he and the five ousted government colleagues who accompanied him to Brussels were seeking ""freedom and safety"" from Spanish authorities.Madrid has cracked down hard on Puigdemont's attempt to take Catalonia, a wealthy region of some 7.5 million people that accounts for about one-fifth of the national GDP, out of Spain. Iran says supreme leader is limiting ballistic missile rangeDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's supreme leader has restricted the range of ballistic missiles manufactured in the country to about 1,200 miles, the head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said Tuesday, which limits their reach to only regional Mideast targets.The comments on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's orders appear to be an effort by Iranian authorities to contrast their missile program, which they often describe as being for defensive purposes, against those of countries like North Korea, which poses a threat to the United States.The range of 1,200 miles encompasses much of the Middle East, including Israel and American military bases in the region. Iran's ballistic missile program was not included in the 2015 nuclear deal that it struck with world powers. Lawsuit targets Trump's rollback of birth-control ruleSOUTH BEND, Ind. -- Two national advocacy groups filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana on Tuesday challenging a rule change by President Donald Trump's administration allowing more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control for workers.The suit was filed on behalf of five women at risk of being denied birth-control coverage, including three University of Notre Dame students. The Catholic university recently told staff and students that it planned to halt no-cost contraceptive coverage starting next year.The suit was filed by the National Women's Law Center and Americans United for Separation of Church and State.The birth-control coverage had been made available under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. The official portraits of Trump, Pence finally are in circulationWASHINGTON -- The White House announced Tuesday that it's releasing official portraits of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to be hung in thousands of government offices nationwide -- nine months after they were sworn in.The portraits had been conspicuously missing from the lobbies of federal building and office walls, which have been graced by empty picture frames and hooks that until Jan. 20 held the portraits of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.Obama's portrait was hung by the third month he was in office in 2009 and Bill Clinton's by June 1993. But for unknown reasons, the White House took this long to take photographs of Trump and Pence and have them printed by the Government Publishing Office. Germany marks Martin Luther's 1517 protestBERLIN -- German leaders on Tuesday marked the 500th anniversary since the day Martin Luther is said to have nailed his theses challenging the Catholic Church to a church door, a starting point of the Reformation.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier took part in a service in the famous Castle Church in Wittenberg, where Luther supposedly posted his 95 Theses on Oct. 31, 1517.In honor of the 500th anniversary, Reformation Day was a public holiday in Germany this year.Wittenberg also celebrated with a medieval-style street festival.As Protestantism spread after Luther's revolt against the Catholic Church, religious wars erupted, dividing Western Christianity in a schism that resulted in hundreds of years of violence, persecution and discrimination. Nurse who was arrested settles for $500,000SALT LAKE CITY -- A Utah nurse who was arrested for refusing to let a police officer draw blood from an unconscious patient said Tuesday that she was settling with Salt Lake City and the university that runs the hospital for $500,000.Nurse Alex Wubbels and her lawyer, Karra Porter, announced the move nearly two months after they released police body-camera video showing Detective Jeff Payne handcuffing Wubbels.The settlement covers all possible defendants in a lawsuit and the payout will be divided among the city and the University of Utah.Wubbel was following hospital policy when she told Payne he needed a warrant or the consent of the patient to draw blood after a July 26 car crash. The patient was not under arrest or a suspect. Payne had neither. New York City lawmakers voted 41-1 Tuesday to legalize dancing in bars, repealing a 91-year-old law that banned boogieing at most city nightspots.The anti-dancing law was enacted in 1926 and prohibited dancing in bars and restaurants that don't have a cabaret license. Critics say the law had been enforced unfairly. The chief editor at National Public Radio is the latest media figure to face allegations of sexual harassment. NPR says that it has placed Michael Oreskes on leave after a report Tuesday that he abruptly kissed two women who were seeking jobs while he was Washington bureau chief at The New York Times in the 1990s.<CAPTION: Photo: Ousted Catalonian official Carles Puigdemont enters a news  conference in Brussels.

171,1881941519.xml,"Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is being kept off the air indefinitely amid the controversy over his unverified claims that British intelligence wiretapped Trump Tower at the behest of former President Barack Obama.
Fox News did not respond to inquiries about Napolitano’s status Monday. Napolitano was conspicuously missing from the network’s coverage of the confirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch - an event in which he typically would have played a significant role. He has not been on the air since Thursday.
People familiar with the situation who could speak only on the condition of anonymity said Napolitano is not expected to be on Fox News Channel any time in the near future. Napolitano was not available for comment.
On March 4, President Donald Trump first tweeted the accusation that Obama ordered his “‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory.”
“Nothing found,” Trump tweeted. “This is McCarthyism!”
The tweet has been widely discredited, but last week, Napolitano heightened the controversy - and caused a major embarrassment for Fox News - when he presented a scenario on several programs that backed the accusation.
The former New Jersey Superior Court judge, citing unnamed sources, said that the British foreign surveillance agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, “most likely” provided Obama with transcripts of Trump’s recorded calls.
“By bypassing all American intelligence services, Obama would have had access to what he wanted with no Obama administration fingerprints,” Napolitano wrote in a column on FoxNews.com.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Napolitano’s charge last week when asked why Trump continues to stand by his initial claim. The British spy agency sharply denounced Napolitano’s allegations, saying they are “utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.""
That rebuttal did not stop Trump from citing Napolitano as a source again when he was asked about the wiretapping claims at a Friday news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“You shouldn’t be talking to me; you should be talking to Fox News,” said Trump, who described Napolitano as “a very talented lawyer.”
Fox News gives its analysts much more latitude than correspondents and anchors in regard to what they can say on the network.
But Napolitano said on one program that ""Fox News has spoken to intelligence community members who believe that surveillance did occur, that it was done by British intelligence.”
Fox News, however, did no such thing, forcing its anchors to walk back Napolitano’s statement.
“Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-president of the United States was surveilled at any time, in any way,” Shepard Smith told viewers Friday.
In a statement read on the Fox News program “MediaBuzz” on Sunday, Napolitano defended his comments. He said he “reported what the sources told me, reported it accurately and I do believe the substance of what they told me.”
On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress that he had “no information” supporting Trump’s claims.

172,1010083104.xml,"      You know them by their righteousness: * The politicians on this flank say: It's natural for government to grow when people's needs grow. If only we raise more tax revenue, we can afford to be the truly great society. And why do you over there frighten citizens with your talk of ""reforming"" their entitlement programs? If we keep spending now to ease our pain and buy more economic growth, then we can address our deficits and debt.   * The politicians on the other flank say: Without your drunken spending spree, there would be no hangover, no need for austerity. More borrowing would be immoral: Two generations of young taxpayers already are doomed to decades of paying off debts created by their parents and grandparents. Yet you over there want more stimulus programs? Why, because the last ones worked so well?   America is a nation divided, riven by ideological schism and subject to leaders who, faced with a crisis, maneuver and stall. Nothing changes a verdict we offered Nov. 6 in the first installment of this occasional editorial series: Some days it seems that either major party would gleefully let the United States implode if it could grab a moment's political advantage over the other.   The next Nov. 6 is the Election Day when voters will, we hope, tell Washington what to do about deficits and debt. Our national division over that question is bad enough; the resulting policy deadlock is a dangerous luxury Americans no longer can afford. Why not? Look around:   No, the dueling camps of righteous pols paraphrased above aren't ... ours. They are combatants in a European conflict: Now they're fiercely debating anew how to rescue their continent from a diabolical trap of -- Oops -- their own making.   This is a brutal time for our friends and allies one ocean to the east. For Americans of every political tilt, though, this is a chance to see our future -- or to learn on the cheap how we can escape the fate of those anguished friends and allies.   Remember as you read on, though: Every minute of every day, federal taxpayers in this country borrow another $3 million. With Washington running its fourth trillion-dollar deficit in four years, those taxpayers soon will owe a total of $16 trillion -- an amount larger than the U.S. gross domestic product: As of now, we owe more than everything we produce in a year.   Where will this fast and furious pace of spending (entitlements are our biggest category) and borrowing (the Chinese are our biggest creditors) deliver us?   The Europeans went decades without asking themselves that question. As they took on more debt, much of it for fabulously generous social programs, interest payments eclipsed the ability of governments to comfortably meet them. Now rescue schemes are forcing those governments to do what their weak self-discipline never could: cut spending. Because those governments are huge players in their domestic economies, cutbacks choke growth. In the turmoil:   * Britain has double-dipped back into recession. Recession also grips Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and the Czech Republic.   * With Monday's resignation of its prime minister, the Netherlands, the eurozone's fifth-biggest economy, is the sixth nation to see the crisis defrock its leader.   * In Spain, where unemployment approaches 25 percent, the potential need for a massive European Union bailout has grown so great that dark wits are calling the country ""too big to save"" -- a play on banks once thought ""too big to fail.""   * In France, Socialist challenger Francois Hollande is favored to take the presidency from Nicolas Sarkozy, who has supported German Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence on eurozone austerity to reduce nations' debts; Hollande exploits anti-German resentments by saying the French Resistance inspires him.   * Portugal's bonds now are rated as junk.   * And while some politicians call for a reversal of austerity policies, with more government borrowing and spending, German central bank chief Jens Weidmann nailed the tendency of pols to weasel out of budget restraints: ""If policymakers think they can avoid this (debt reduction), they will try to,"" he told The Wall Street Journal. ""That's why the pressure has to be kept up.""   What about the pressure here at home? Trustees warned last week that by 2024, Medicare will exhaust its trust fund; the Social Security fund will be empty by 2033. At those points, benefits drop to whatever levels taxpayers can support year to year. Yet House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan earns scorn from opponents for cloaking his proposed Medicare reforms in harsh truths: ""This plan is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government.""   What most aggravates us isn't this or that proposal for addressing debt -- slash spending? raise taxes? -- but the refusal of both major parties to do much more than posture to the body politic.   Whatever the policy answer for this country, Europe ought to be an urgent, five-alarm warning of what happens when debts blithely rise and lenders, fearing default, get frightened. Europe's crisis has devolved into the austerity-versus-spending battle in which no economic flower can bloom. Is that the future we Americans want to import? And if not, then why don't our leaders act while they still can shape our fate?   Imagine what would happen if Washington surprised us. If Republicans and Democrats realized how their election-year game of chicken deters growth -- business expansion, job creation. If leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House admitted: We can soak in the same cold bath as Europe. Or we can make our debt stop growing right now.   Imagine, too, the gratitude from a nation still divided, but closer to solvent.  ",2012-04-29
173,1448198920.xml,"       Every disaster has its moment of clarity. Physicist Richard Feynman dunks an O-ring into ice water and everyone understands instantly why the shuttle Challenger exploded. Last month, the Obamacare O-ring froze for all the world to see: Hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters went out to people who had been assured a dozen times by the president that ""if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan. Period."" The cancellations lay bare three pillars of Obamacare: (a) mendacity, (b) paternalism and (c) subterfuge.   (A) Those letters are irrefutable evidence that President Barack Obama's repeated you-keep-your-coverage claim was false. Why were they sent out? Because Obamacare renders illegal (with exceedingly narrow ""grandfathered"" exceptions) the continuation of any insurance plan deemed by Washington regulators not to meet their arbitrary standards for adequacy. Example: No maternity care? You are terminated.   So a law designed to cover the uninsured is now throwing far more people off their insurance than it can possibly be signing up on the nonfunctioning insurance exchanges. Indeed, most of the 19 million people with individual insurance will have to find new and likely more expensive coverage. And that doesn't even include the additional millions who are sure to lose their employer-provided coverage. That's a lot of people. That's a pretty big lie.   But perhaps Obama didn't know. Maybe the bystander president was as surprised by this as he claims to have been by the IRS scandal, The Associated Press and James Rosen phone logs, the failure of the Obamacare website, the premeditation of the Benghazi attacks, the tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone -- i.e., the workings of the federal government of which he is the nominal head.   I'm skeptical. It's not as if the Obamacare plan-dropping is an obscure regulation. It's at the heart of Obama's idea of federally regulated and standardized national health insurance.   Still, how could he imagine getting away with a claim sure to be exposed as factually false?   The same way he maintained for two weeks that false narrative about Benghazi. He figured he'd get away with it.   And he did. Simple formula: Delay, stonewall and wait for a supine and protective press to turn spectacularly incurious.   Look at how The New York Times covered his ""keep your plan"" whopper -- buried on Page 17 with a headline calling the cancellations a ""prime target."" As if this is a partisan issue and not a brazen falsehood clear to any outside observer -- say, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, who gave the president's claim four Pinocchios. Noses don't come any longer.   (B) Beyond mendacity, there is liberal paternalism, of which these forced cancellations are a classic case. We canceled your plan, explained White House spokesman Jay Carney, because it was substandard. We have a better idea.   Translation: Sure, you freely chose the policy, paid for the policy, renewed the policy, liked the policy. But you're too primitive to know what you need. We do. Your policy is hereby canceled.   Because what you really need is what our experts have determined must be in every plan. So a couple in their 60s must buy maternity care. A teetotaler must buy substance abuse treatment. And a healthy 28-year-old with appropriate catastrophic insurance must pay for bells and whistles for which he has no use.   (C) As for subterfuge, these required bells and whistles aren't just there to festoon the health care Christmas tree with voter-pleasing freebies. The planners knew all along that if you force insurance buyers to overpay for stuff they don't need, that money can subsidize other people.   Obamacare is the largest transfer of wealth in recent American history. But you can't say that openly lest you lose elections. So you do it by subterfuge: hidden taxes, penalties, mandates and coverage requirements that yield a surplus of overpayments.   So that your president can promise to cover 30 million uninsured without costing the government a dime. Which from the beginning was the biggest falsehood of them all. And yet the free lunch is the essence of modern liberalism. Free mammograms, free preventive care, free contraceptives for Sandra Fluke. Come and get it.   And then when you find your policy canceled, your premium raised and your deductible outrageously increased, you've learned the real meaning of ""free"" in the liberal lexicon: something paid for by your neighbor -- best, by subterfuge.   ----------  letters@charleskrauthammer.com  ",2013-11-04
174,852848552.xml,"      Among their other headaches, some of Europe's biggest leaders are troubled by the lukewarm state of their countries' melting pots. As in the United States, a combination of economic recession, terrorism fears and electoral politics has made scapegoats out of immigrants and government multiculturalism policies. Unlike the United States, they don't have a melting-pot tradition. Instead they've tried a brand of multiculturalism that's getting bad reviews.  State multiculturalism has had ""disastrous results,"" says British Prime Minister David Cameron. It has ""totally failed,"" says German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""Clearly, yes, it is a failure,"" agrees French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Has ""multikulti,"" as the Germans call it derisively, indeed failed Europe's great leaders? Or are they simply not doing it right?  Multiculturalism means different things to different people. On its best days, it is a salad bowl or mulligan stew alternative to the melting pot. In this country, it means a respect for cultural differences while remembering that, most of all, we're all still Americans, part of a cultural mainstream that is worth assimilating into, even if our leaders sometimes make mistakes.  Cameron, Merkel and Sarkozy, among others, are recognizing that their multiculturalism policies have brought respect for cultural diversity but failed to integrate and assimilate diverse ethnic communities, particularly Muslims, into the mainstream.   When Merkel says Germany's experiment has failed, for example, she is talking about her country's ""gastarbeiters"" or guest workers of mostly Turkish, Arabic and Kurdish stock. Invited since the early 1960s to fill labor shortages, they have stayed longer and grown larger in population than expected without fully integrating or assimilating.  Now Merkel is facing a tough re-election campaign with voices on the right grumbling about immigrants while German industrialists want even more immigrant workers. As a result, Merkel took pains to say that all immigrants are still welcome, but also asks, among other requests, that they please try to learn some German.  Cameron called for a ""more active, more muscular liberalism"" in a recent Munich speech to counter the current ""doctrine of state multiculturalism"" that has led to alienation and even jihadism among young British Muslims. Cameron also called for the active promotion of democratic values, the rule of law, freedom of speech and equal rights.  That begins to sound like the American model. Our debate has centered in various ways on how cultural differences can be respected without causing our melting pot to boil over.  Sometimes we have panicky outbursts of xenophobia like Arizona's recent legislation to outlaw ethnic studies. The state's new attorney general, Tom Horne, wrote the law when he was the state's superintendent of schools. He thought the Mexican-American studies classes offered in Tucson's schools encouraged too much separatism and resentment toward mainstream American culture. Unfortunately, his remedy probably alienates immigrant communities even more.  So does Oklahoma's referendum issue that voters approved in November to outlaw Shariah law, even though there was no known effort to impose the Islamic legal code in their state. At least a dozen other states are reported to be considering similar legislation, despite its distinct aroma of Islamophobia.  In short, there's a thin line between efforts that encourage full participation in mainstream American culture and those that punish one particular culture. We can oppose arranged marriages, animal sacrifices, speech censorship and other cultural practices that conflict with American law and freedoms without disrespecting the home cultures of those who sincerely want to be Americans.  Doing multiculturalism right calls for striking a balance between a respect for diverse cultures and respect for the common culture we all share. Regardless of their origin, immigrants to this country tend to be driven by a desire to find opportunity and stir themselves into our melting pot. Even if the first generation resists, their children tend to embrace the America of ""Sesame Street"" and Big Macs with great enthusiasm.  By contrast, Europe has allowed large communities of immigrants to grow in ethnic enclaves that endure from one generation to the next with remarkably little assimilation.  Don't blame multiculturalism for that failure. Blame people. People will have to fix it.  ---------- Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune's editorial board and blogs at chicagotribune.com/pagespage  cpage@tribune.com Credit: By Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune's editorial board Caption: Graphic: MIKE MINER/TRIBUNE ILLUSTRATION  ",2011-02-20
175,2302324503.xml,"Protesters move into capital of Ecuador; president moves out QUITO, Ecuador -- Thousands of indigenous people, some carrying sticks, converged on Ecuador's capital Tuesday as anti-government protests and clashes led the president to move his besieged administration out of Quito.The South American country of 17 million appeared to be at a dangerous impasse, paralyzed by a lack of public transport and blockaded roads that were taking a toll on an already vulnerable economy.Violence, which began last week when President Lenin Moreno's decision to cut subsidies led to a sharp increase in fuel prices, has persisted for days. Several oil wells ceased production totaling 65,000 barrels daily because protesters seized installations, the Energy Ministry said.Rioters have smashed car windows, broken into shops and confronted security forces who fired tear gas to disperse crowds.Some video footage has shown police beating protesters. Opponents have accused Moreno's government of human rights abuses in its attempts to quell disturbances.On Tuesday, Moreno met Cabinet ministers in the port city of Guayaquil after moving government operations from Quito because of security threats.In a televised address late Monday, he said he was the target of a coup attempt, but would not back down from his decision to cut subsidies contributing to huge public debt that soared before he took office. The cuts were among measures announced as part of a $4.2 billion funding plan with the International Monetary Fund, which said the package will strengthen Ecuador's economy and generate jobs. Italian lawmakers back push to reduce seats in ParliamentROME -- Italian lawmakers have backed a radical overhaul of the country's parliament that will see around a third of them losing their job.The long-awaited reform, overwhelmingly approved Tuesday by the lower house, will see the total number of lawmakers slashed by about a third, from 945 to 600. The vote, the final one in the parliamentary process, was 553-14.The reform is set to be implemented after the next scheduled elections in 2023, though there are potentially further hurdles to clear, including a possible referendum.The reduction was a proposal of the anti-establishment 5-Stars, which in August forged a coalition with the center-left Democrats. They said the reduction will save about $330,000 a day.Premier Giuseppe Conte hailed the decision as ""a historic day for Italy.""

Lego said the pieces will be cleaned and given to Teach for America, a nonprofit that will donate them to classrooms across the U.S. Some bricks will be also sent to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston for after-school programs.Lego, like other brands, is seeking to please customers worried about plastic's environmental impact.It is also working to find other materials for its colorful bricks. Johnson faces criticism from EU over Brexit after Merkel callLONDON -- An anonymous official in Boris Johnson's office told broadcast reporters Tuesday that negotiations with European leaders over Brexit were ""essentially impossible"" after the British prime minister concluded a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.European officials hit back that Johnson was trying to blame them for a breakdown in talks.The anonymous source asserted that the Europeans would not budge an inch.The British government said it will leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal. Many in the EU are skeptical of that claim because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19. Couple get month sentence in college test scandalBOSTON -- A business executive and his wife, a former journalist, were each sentenced to a month in prison Tuesday for paying $125,000 to rig their daughter's college entrance exams in a scandal involving dozens of wealthy and sometimes famous parents.Gregory and Marcia Abbott, of New York and Colorado, were sentenced in Boston's federal court after pleading guilty to a single count of fraud and conspiracy.The Abbotts paid $50,000 to have a test proctor correct their daughter's ACT exam answers in 2018, along with $75,000 to rig her SAT subject tests in math and literature, authorities said. They kept the scheme hidden from their daughter.Meanwhile, the case's lead prosecutor said he plans for longer prison sentences for ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin and other parents contesting charges.

176,2071187059.xml,"President Donald Trump's claim that immigration is negatively “changing the culture” of Europe may be his ugliest racial-ethnic dog whistle yet. But it also points to a disturbing observation, his cozying up not only to Russian President Vladimir Putin but also to rising far-right, populist ethno-nationalism movements spreading across Europe.
In a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May before his Monday meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump claimed immigration is negatively “changing the culture” of Europe.
Although he offered no evidence or examples to back up his remarks, Trump said he believed immigration has been “very bad for Europe,” adding that he knew it was not politically correct to talk about but he would “say it loud.”
Like a host whose guest has just dropped something foul into the punch bowl, Prime Minister May bravely defended immigration as a benefit to the United Kingdom, which “has a proud history of welcoming people.” That’s the attitude that has helped the industrialized West to grow strong over the decades.
Yet May knew she was not alone among NATO allies who had become a pincushion for Trump’s criticisms. For days, he tweeted barbs at German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s approach to Europe’s migration crisis over which her fragile government wrestles with deep internal divisions.
Trump asserted erroneously that crime in Germany is ""way up"" and that immigrants are to blame. ""Big mistake made all over Europe,” he tweeted, “in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!""
Yet those sentiments contrast sharply with the praise that Trump has heaped on conservative Euro-skeptic leaders like Italy’s new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Hungary's Viktor Orban.
EDITORIAL: Trump's blunt me$$age to NATO »
Conte, scheduled to visit the White House at the end of July, was praised as “a really great guy” by Trump at the summit of Group of Seven leaders in Quebec in June. The two apparently bonded over the treatment of migrants and the global role to be played by Russia. Conte, leading a coalition of far-right and anti-globalist parties, was the only G-7 leader to voice support for Trump’s suggestion that Russia, ejected from the group after its invasion of Crimea in Ukraine, should be readmitted.
Orban, after his third landslide election victory since 2010, basks in popularity for his country’s economic gains under his party’s watch. But he also has guided his government in a troubling authoritarian direction and fanned the public’s anger and anxieties over Europe’s refugee crisis.
Taking the global view, we can see Trump’s apparent affection for autocrats and Euro-nationalism goes far beyond Putin. Trump was surprisingly elected to the Oval Office weeks after the U.K. surprisingly voted to leave the European Union; his rise parallels the rise of populist ethno-nationalists and autocrats across Europe and elsewhere on the planet.
Europe’s far right gained a big boost from anger and anxieties following the the 2008 financial collapse and the flood of refugees from wars in the Middle East and North Africa.
In the past, we have seen all sorts of ugly extremism rise to power on populism and nationalism, usually in the wake of big societal changes, none of which seems to have more salience than tribal changes, particularly changes involving race, religion or ethnicity.
That’s why Trump’s alarm over immigrants “changing the culture” in Europe brought delight to white nationalists. As Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, observed, It comes “straight out of the white supremacist, white nationalist playbook.”
In the endless battle to keep this new tribalism from ripping our civilization apart, the United States has a distinct advantage: our long-running tradition of welcoming newcomers and encouraging their assimilation into our social mainstream.
That’s still a new thing for the industrialized nations of Europe, for example, where language and ethnicity are closely tied to national identity. Much of the domestic anxiety over new arrivals in Europe comes from policies that have left immigrants in ghettos, separated from the mainstream culture and economic opportunities.
America, by contrast, has been the land of makeovers and reinvention. Immigrants from everywhere are attracted by the opportunities this nation offers to build a better life and a new identity — as Americans.
The more we encourage the virtue of inclusion against the lure of the tribe, the better we can keep our proverbial melting pot simmering, instead of boiling over.

177,1474785766.xml,"       Court hears appeal to ease Texas abortion law A federal court heard an appeal from Planned Parenthood and other advocacy groups Monday to relax a restrictive abortion law in Texas that has caused a dozen clinics to suspend services.   The law requires doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where the abortion is performed.   Given the size of Texas, the requirement places an unjust burden on clinics, Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the appeal, told a three-judge panel in Louisiana.   Only four of the 12 clinics that had suspended procedures have been able to resume procedures after meeting the requirements of the laws that went into effect in late October 2013.   ""It's hard to tell what the court is going to do, but everything in this case has happened really quickly, so we're looking at maybe a few weeks for an opinion,"" said Janet Crepps, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights.   Whole Women's Health clinic in San Antonio and Abortion Advantage in Dallas recently resumed providing abortions after their doctors gained hospital privileges.   A Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin resumed services in November.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, which is hearing the case, on Oct. 31 reinstated a restriction that was blocked by a lower court, thus allowing nearly all the sweeping anti-abortion law in Texas to go into effect.  Bangladeshi PM: New vote hinges on halt to violence   A day after rolling to victory in an election boycotted by the main opposition party and marred by deadly unrest, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held to her stance that a fresh election can be called only if her rivals halt violence.   With the opposition already having called a 48-hour strike and seven people killed in clashes Monday, the crisis showed no sign of easing, risking further damage to the $22 billion garment industry, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's exports.  Man gets 8 months for hitting child on airplane   ATLANTA -- A former aerospace executive who slapped a crying toddler and called the boy, who is black, a racial slur on a flight was sentenced Monday to eight months in prison for the incident, which his attorney blamed on his alcoholism.   Joe Rickey Hundley, who apologized in court to the child's mother, was accused of striking the 19-month-old boy onboard a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta in February.  1 of 2 teens convicted in Ohio rape case released   One of two high school football players convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl at an August 2012 party in Steubenville, Ohio, has been released from juvenile detention, his lawyer said.   The teen completed his sentence at the Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility on Sunday, according to a statement released by attorney Walter Madison. Images of the unconscious victim circulated online after the rape, drawing national outrage.  'Jihad Jane' sentenced to 10 years in prison   PHILADELPHIA -- The woman who dubbed herself ""Jihad Jane"" was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison Monday for a range of terrorism offenses, including conspiring to murder a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the Prophet Muhammad as a dog.   Colleen LaRose, 50, could have received a life term for what U.S. District Judge Petrese Tucker called ""gravely serious"" crimes, but he tempered the punishment because of her cooperation.

Egyptian police boost presence at churches   CAIRO -- Egyptian police deployed at churches across the country with orders to use live ammunition to protect Coptic Christians over their Christmas holiday, the Interior Ministry said Monday.   Dozens of churches and Christian properties were attacked in August, the month after the army overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.   Since then, sectarian rhetoric from Islamists against Christians has intensified and authorities are on alert.

178,2501205077.xml,"LONDON -- Irish health officials Sunday recommended the temporary suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports of serious blood clotting after inoculations in Norway.   Dr. Ronan Glynn, Ireland's deputy chief medical officer, said the recommendation was made after Norway's medicines agency reported four cases of blood clotting in adults after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.He said that while there was no conclusive link between the vaccine and the cases, Irish health officials are recommending the suspension of the vaccine's rollout as a precaution. Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic authorities have taken similar precautionary steps.The Netherlands followed suit late Sunday, suspending vaccinations with the AstraZeneca shot as a precaution for two weeks.AstraZeneca said in a statement Sunday that it ""would like to offer its reassurance on the safety of its COVID-19 vaccine based on clear scientific evidence.""The company said that a review of safety data of more than 17 million people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Union and the U.K. ""has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country."" Italian lockdown: Italians enjoyed the last weekend outdoors before three-quarters of the population is scheduled to enter into a strict lockdown Monday, when the government puts in place restrictive measures to fight the rise in coronavirus infections.A more contagious variant first identified in the United Kingdom, combined with a slow vaccine rollout, led to a 15% increase in cases in Italy last week, a worrisome picture for the government run by Prime Minister Mario Draghi.Most regions in northern Italy, as well as Lazio and Marche in central Italy and Campania and Puglia in the south, will shut schools and forbid residents from leaving their homes except for work, health or necessity. Only supermarkets, pharmacies and a few other stores will stay open, but restaurants will be shut. Myanmar protests: At least four people were shot and killed during protests Sunday in Myanmar as security forces continued their violent crackdown against dissent following last month's military coup.Two of the victims were killed in Yangon, the country's largest city. One of them was shot in the head and another was shot in the abdomen, according to local media covering the demonstrations in Hlaing Thar Yar Township.A third person died in the northern city of Hpakant when police fired into a crowd of demonstrators. A fourth victim, a woman, died after being shot in the head in Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, as security forces were conducting clearance operations.

German elections: Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right party suffered clear defeats in two German state elections Sunday at the hands of popular governors from parties further to the left, according to projections. The setback comes six months before a national vote that will determine who succeeds the country's longtime leader.Sunday's votes for new state legislatures in the southwestern states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate kicked off an electoral marathon that features another four state ballots and the Sept. 26 national election.Amid discontent over a sluggish start to Germany's vaccination drive, with most coronavirus restrictions still in place and infections rising again, Merkel's Union bloc has been hit over the past two weeks by allegations that two lawmakers profited from deals to procure masks early in the coronavirus pandemic.Merkel's Christian Democratic Union already faced a challenging task against well-liked governors.Projections for ARD and ZDF public television, based on exit polls and a partial count of votes, showed those governors' parties -- the environmentalist Greens in Baden-Wuerttemberg and the center-left Social Democrats in Rhineland-Palatinate -- finishing first, some 7 to 9 percentage points ahead of the CDU.The CDU's projected showings of about 23% and 27%, respectively, were the party's worst since World War II in both states. London police under fire: London's police commissioner Sunday defended her officers' actions and said she didn't intend to resign, after coming under heavy criticism for the way police treated some protesters during a vigil for a woman whom one of the force's own officers is accused of murdering.Hundreds defied coronavirus restrictions Saturday to protest violence against women and remember Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old London resident whose disappearance and killing prompted a national outcry. But the vigil ended with clashes and many questioned whether the police force was too heavy-handed.Police were seen scuffling with some women at the event, and one woman was seen pinned to the ground by two officers.On Sunday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said she was personally appalled by the attack on Everard and she was more determined than ever to lead the organization. Kosovo Embassy in Israel: Kosovo's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it has formally opened its embassy to Israel in the disputed city of Jerusalem.A statement said the move was made after the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel on Feb. 1 and a Kosovo-Serbia summit held at the White House in September.Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed, as the capital of a future state.Most of the international community doesn't recognize the Israeli annexation of east Jerusalem.

180,346471456.xml,"      The first duty of national leaders is to worry about the self-interest of their own countries; utopian internationalism can come later. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, despite her soaring European Union rhetoric, is relearning that lesson. German voters in a recent parliamentary election rebuked her for bailing out the spendthrift Greeks with hard-earned German money. Barack Obama should take note. Last year, Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize not for what he did, but for what he represented -- to the European judges a new post-national American president. His subsequent apology tours abroad have emphasized American sins without much discussion of the context of the times. In Cairo last year, the president inaccurately claimed that Islam helped to foster Western achievements like the Renaissance and Enlightenment. In such moments, Obama sounds as if he thinks America has to be perfect to be good, while other nations merely need to be OK. Even though Obama apparently has no intention of closing down Guantanamo Bay as he promised -- or ending tribunals, renditions, Predator targeted assassinations, wiretaps and intercepts -- he continues to fault former President George W. Bush's war on terror and promises the world that he will reset American foreign policy. Consequently, the mixed message goes out abroad that if you were anti-American from 2001 to 2008, you probably had reasonable complaints; and if you were friendly, you may now seem suspect. Obama's new outreach to Iran, Syria and Venezuela tells the world, fairly or not, that the United States -- not these anti-American authoritarians -- was responsible for tense relations in the past. Meanwhile, the old special relationship with democratic Britain, the once unquestioned support for democratic Israel, and missile defense for democratic Eastern Europe all seem passe. Recently, Obama went too far when he invited Mexican President Felipe Calderon to the White House. Side by side with Obama, Calderon summarily trashed the voters of Arizona for demanding enforcement of their nation's immigration laws: ""It is a law that not only ignores a reality ... but also introduces a terrible idea, using racial profiling as the basis for law enforcement."" Wrong. In truth, the law prohibits racial profiling. The new Arizona statute allows law enforcement to request proof of citizenship of only those detained for other reasons -- and only if there is sufficient reason to doubt their citizenship. Obama right there should have corrected Calderon's unfair caricatures -- and a foreign head of state's inappropriate and disingenuous intrusion into American politics. The Mexican government treats illegal immigrants from Central America far less sympathetically. And not long ago, Mexico printed a comic book instructing its own citizens how to break American law -- cynically assuming its own fleeing citizens were illiterate and without worry about illegally entering Mexico's northern neighbor. Obama, however, mentioned the growing irrelevance of borders themselves. He cited his worry about the propriety of an Arizona law that receives a 70 percent approval rating among Americans. Even if Obama thinks America is not necessarily an exceptional nation, the president should side with states that want to enforce federal laws rather than with nations that seek to circumvent them. The Obama-Calderon criticism of Arizona came after Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner, in a meeting with Chinese envoys, on his own initiative raised the issue of Arizona's immigration law. Posner wanted to offer his own example of America's morally equivalent problems with issues of human rights. He forgot, however, to actually read the Arizona law -- and that he was discussing human rights with a regime that routinely denies its citizens rights, and not all that long ago killed millions of its own citizens and swallowed Tibet. Instead of seeing his nation or its states as the problem, Obama would do better to focus on the woes of the European Union, North Korea's sinking of a South Korean ship, Iran's plans to get the bomb, continued terrorist attacks in the U.S., wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Mexico's encouragement of its own citizens to violate American immigration law. Right now there are quite enough foreign felonies in the world without dwelling on American misdemeanors. ---------- author@victorhanson.com Credit: By Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution: Tribune Media Services  ",2010-05-28

Party leaders and their deputies began meeting with each other informally on Monday to sound out possible coalition deals. The process could take days or even weeks.    On paper, Angela Merkel would appear to be in the strongest position. She is hoping to become Germany's first female chancellor and the first to come from the former East Germany. Her party, the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, finished first in the balloting, but just barely. The CDU won 225 seats in Germany's parliament with 35.2 percent of the vote,; Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party, the SPD, won 222 seats with 34.3 percent.    But after conducting a lackluster campaign, Merkel squandered a 21-point lead in opinion polls, and the mood within the CDU on Monday was mutinous.    ""After today Angela Merkel is history in the CDU,"" said Matthias Wambach, a CDU member of the Bundestag, Germany's parliament.    The SPD quickly sensed her vulnerability. SPD Chairman Franz Muentefering claimed Monday that the voters had sent a ""clear message.""    ""This country does not want Mrs. Merkel as chancellor,"" he declared.    In fact, the only clear message to emerge from Sunday's voting is that the coalition of the SPD and Green Party that has ruled the country for the past seven years has been voted out.    But Schroeder is claiming that despite losing his majority, his better-than-expected showing should be interpreted as a mandate to form a new government.    Schroeder looks for partner    Schroeder seems to believe that he can persuade the pro-business Free Democratic Party to abandon Merkel and join him in a coalition.    Thus far, not a single FDP official has shown any interest. Another possibility, somewhat less remote, is that the Green Party will dump Schroeder and join a coalition with CDU and FDP.    On Monday, Merkel said Schroeder's SPD had to ""accept that they are not the strongest party.""    The most likely scenario is that the CDU and SPD will agree to share power in a ""grand coalition."" Only once before has there been this kind of arrangement in Germany, in 1966-69, when Kurt Kiesinger and Willy Brandt formed a grand coalition.    Although it worked well for Kiesinger and Brandt, most political professionals see this as a formula for political gridlock and new elections in two years.    Merkel would be more likely than Schroeder to emerge as the chancellor in a grand coalition, and Schroeder probably would retire from politics. If the negotiations over chancellor break down, President Horst Koehler could nominate a candidate--Merkel, Schroeder or perhaps a compromise candidate--and his choice would be put to a vote in the Bundestag.    Merkel, a 51-year-old former physicist, campaigned on a platform of reform. She told Germans that the country needed to liberalize its economy and trim its generous social welfare benefits if it was to overcome five years of near-zero growth and a jobless rate of 11.6 percent.    The divided electorate    The 77.7 percent turnout of voters delivered a split verdict.    ""Nearly 50 percent of the electorate voted for parties that want to promote reforms, and the same number voted for parties that do not want to promote further reforms or that want to take some reforms back,"" said Juergen Falter, a political analyst writing in the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel.    A prolonged political deadlock in Germany would be ""a big setback for Europe,"" said William Drozdiak, president of the American Council on Germany.    ""As Germany goes, so goes the rest of Europe. Germany really needs to accelerate the reform process,"" he said.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO: Workers remove an election poster for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party in Hamburg on Monday.

182,1559525046.xml,"       Donald Tusk relied on a mix of charm and pragmatism to rise to  the top of Polish politics and stay in power longer than anyone  since the Cold War ended. Being the European Union's president will  test the extent of those talents. Emerging from a bitter contest as the 28-nation group's first  leader from the former communist east, the 57-year-old will arrive  in December after seven years as his country's prime minister.  He'll inherit a bloc fraught with discord over issues from the  conflict in Ukraine to a sluggish economy at home.  Tusk has spent more than two decades navigating Poland's often  acrimonious post-communist politics. Ruthless at times, ditching  allies when needed, his supreme talent is his charm, according to  Pawel Piskorski, who co-founded the Civic Platform party with Tusk  in 2001 before being forced out in 2006. Tusk is a master at  ""seducing"" allies over red wine, cigars and discussions of his  favorites from ancient Greece and Rome, according to Piskorski's  2014 memoir, ""Between Us Liberals.""  ""He's great at smiling and doing the meets-and-greets,"" Piskorski  said. ""If being premier was mostly about meeting people, that would  be his natural role. Anything to do with administration is a chore  for him.""  In his first appearance after receiving the nomination, Tusk  focused on the deal-making that's the hallmark of the EU  presidency, pledging to strive for ""intelligent compromise"" on the  array of crises confronting the union.  While the European Union president has limited authority, he can  play a role in shaping consensus at summits with the national  leaders who wield real power in the bloc. Herman Van Rompuy made  his mark as the first full-time president by brokering compromises  between Germany and deficit-scarred nations.  The selection of Tusk at the same time Italian Foreign Minister  Federica Mogherini was named chief diplomat reflected the EU's  divisions over handling relations with Russia. Mogherini, 41, faced  criticism in Eastern Europe for seeking an accommodation with the  Kremlin.  Tusk has emerged as a forceful advocate on the Ukrainian issue in  an alliance that lacks ""political courage and a willingness to make  decisions,"" according to Bartlomiej Biskup, a political scientist  at Warsaw University.  ""History has come full circle and more than words, we need real  policy,"" the prime minister said Monday at a pre-dawn ceremony in  the Gdansk suburb of Westerplatte, where 75 years ago the first  shots of World War II were fired. ""In resolving to end war, we  can't be weak or deluded about people and states which want war to  further their own purposes.""  Poland's front-line status in the Ukraine crisis has helped propel  Tusk into the limelight. Poland has been involved in the turmoil  across its eastern border from early this year.  Since Viktor Yanukovych's ouster as president in February and the  Russian seizure of Crimea the following month, Tusk has sought to  keep the EU united in support of a Ukrainian government that's  fighting pro-Russian insurgents. He warned in March that Ukraine  may turn into ""a black hole"" dominated by Russian intelligence  services and organized crime.  That's not to say that Tusk is viewed as an anti-Russian hard-liner  by the standards of politics in Poland, where centuries of conflict  and subjugation have fueled suspicion of the large power to the  east.  Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ex-premier defeated by Tusk in 2007  elections, said in May that his successor's declared policy of  standing up to Russia has ""zero credibility"" because he's ""all hard  talk and practically no action.""  As a facilitator, Tusk will be able to lean on a bond he forged  with Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel. The two leaders are  pragmatists and share a commitment to fiscal prudence as an  economic priority.  In addition to their common experience of growing up under  communism, Merkel and Tusk bonded last year over the Polish  heritage of one of her grandfathers.  The bond has been made easier by Tusk's roots in Kashubia, a region  in northwest Poland where German has traditionally been spoken  along with a local dialect. Tusk still spends weekends with his  wife there at an apartment in the Baltic resort of Sopot, where  they raised two children.  The personal relationship helps keep Polish-German relations  smooth, Tusk said in April 2013.  ""I think we've both made our modest contribution, not least through  our personal backgrounds,"" he said. ""I thought to myself: She's the  granddaughter of a high school principal in Gdansk, and I'm the  grandson of a railroad worker from Gdansk, so before the war they  were neighbors.""

183,2540942260.xml,"Before President Joe Biden’s summit Wednesday with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in an 18th-century villa, Republicans in Congress and conservative media outlets like Fox News have coalesced around a succinct line of attack: Biden is weak when it comes to dealing with the Russian leader.
Some of Biden’s most prominent critics, however, neglect to mention their backing of President Donald Trump as he spent four years seeking to befriend Putin, dismissing Russia’s aggressive behavior and complaining that a “Deep State” and other Washington actors were preventing him from striking deals with Moscow.
On Tuesday, shortly before Biden departed on Air Force One from Brussels for Geneva, where he will meet with Putin for the first time in more than a decade, the website of Fox News published an opinion essay by Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of state under Trump, arguing that Biden “shows up with a self-dealt weak hand.”
The idea that Biden is no match for the Russian has been a regular theme on the network’s programming in recent weeks.
On his prime-time program Monday night, Fox host Sean Hannity declared that Putin “will see firsthand how weak Joe is,” adding that “Putin loves a weak America and a weak American president.”
During the Trump years, both men — along with many other prominent conservatives — to varying degrees defended or excused Trump’s approach to Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded had ordered a campaign to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.
“We are the toughest administration ever on Russia,” Pompeo insisted during Senate testimony in July, citing sanctions that were imposed on Moscow, often with Trump’s grudging approval at best.
In recent weeks, many other Republicans, not all of whom defended Trump’s approach, have charged that Biden has been soft on Russia. Many have cited Biden’s decision last month to waive Congressional sanctions on the Russian company behind the Nord Stream 2 oil and gas pipeline and the company’s German CEO.
Opponents of the pipeline say it gives Putin needed new revenues and dangerous control over Europe’s energy supplies. Biden had opposed the pipeline, but in the end gave in to the arguments of supporters, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who contend that the risks are overblown.
The pipeline, mostly built during the Trump era, was about 95% complete by the time Biden took office, and it was unclear whether he could have stopped it even if he tried. In explaining his decision, Biden said that imposing the sanctions would be “counterproductive in terms of our European relations.”
“We’re rewarding Putin with a summit? Instead of treating Putin like a gangster who fears his own people, we’re giving him his treasured Nord Stream 2 pipeline and legitimizing his actions with a summit,” Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a May 25 statement. Sasse was a harsh critic of Trump.
But his critique reflected wide sentiment within the Republican Party and among allies of Trump.
“Biden is weak. Putin knows it,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted June 2.
The White House rejects the notion that the meeting with Putin amounts to a concession, and privately officials say the problem with Trump’s meetings with the Russian leader was not that they took place but what they said was Trump’s obsequious approach.
In a briefing this month, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden “is never one to hold back on areas where he has concern, areas where he feels the actions of the Russian government or Russian leadership are hurting the United States. And he certainly has no intention of holding back during this meeting, publicly or privately.”

184,1008688759.xml,"      Hours after 40,000 runners gathered at Place de la  Concorde, the historic gateway to the French capital, for the start  of the Paris Marathon, Nicolas Sarkozy was in the same spot for a  rally marking the home stretch of a long re-election campaign. The French president -- and avid runner -- intended to show he was  in fighting shape to win the race.  Unfortunately, last weekend's event evoked an entirely different  symbolism: Place de la Concorde is, after all, where King Louis XVI  and his wife, Marie Antoinette, lost their heads to the guillotine.  Nobody expects Sarkozy to lose his head in Sunday's election,  except metaphorically. But if Sarkozy succeeds in overtaking his  Socialist rival,  Francois Hollande,  it will be one of the most  astonishing comebacks in French political history.  The latest opinion polls show the two men to be neck and neck for  the first round of voting but give Hollande a lead of 10 to 14  percentage points in the expected runoff two weeks later.  The truth is that Sarkozy, 57, has never succeeded in shaking off  the negative impression he made at the beginning of his five-year  term, that the conservative leader was the ""president of the rich.""  That image plays badly, especially given that a few months after he  took office, the recession hit, leading to belt-tightening.  Before the 2007 election, he had hinted that he would go into  retreat in the days before the transfer of power to consider how to  lead France. Instead he threw a party at Fouquet's, one of the most  ostentatious restaurants in France. Then he spent a few days  vacationing in the Mediterranean on the yacht of a billionaire.  The flashy watches and aviator sunglasses simply cemented his  reputation as the ""bling-bling"" president.  Manuel Valls, a spokesman for Hollande, believes the French were,  and remain, shocked by Sarkozy's attitude in those first weeks.  ""Nicolas Sarkozy had spoken of rupture and reform, but his personal  behavior and symbolism of that time were terrible. ...  He also  increased his salary by 140 percent. People were absolutely shocked  by this.""  Sarkozy promised to turn France away from its traditional  partnership with Germany and remold the country along more  Anglo-Saxon free-market lines. His France would be more dynamic and  competitive. People who ""got up early"" and those who wanted to  ""work more to gain more"" would be encouraged and would have more  money in their pockets. It was a formula that won over the French  electorate.  Unfortunately, the economic crisis soon ended his ambitious plans.  Instead, Sarkozy found himself presiding over rampant unemployment,  a damaging public spending deficit and the loss of France's  triple-A credit rating. Instead of moving away from Germany, he  found himself in lock step with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to  extinguish  debt conflagrations in Europe that threatened the  stability of the continent and the euro.  In the last few weeks, Sarkozy has given the impression he is  flailing. Britain's right-of-center Daily Telegraph said he has led  a ""carpet bomb"" campaign that has shifted from one theme to another  and in which Sarkozy has attempted to re-brand himself as less the  president of the rich and more the people's president.  But Franck Riester, a Sarkozy spokesman, remains optimistic. ""I  feel very strongly that nothing is final. I am totally convinced  it's not over for Nicolas Sarkozy, not only for the first round,  but also for the second.""  In Place de la Concorde last Sunday, Sarkozy appealed to  the  people.  ""People of France, hear my appeal. French men and women help me,  help me, help France.""  That did not stop the left-leaning Le Nouvel Observateur magazine  from pointing out that when he went to shake hands in the crowd, he  took off his watch.  Was he more worried about it being lost or stolen, or about the  damage a Patek Philippe  timepiece worth an estimated $72,000 might  do to his efforts to appear a man of the people?  - - - How elections work in France  PARIS -- Here are some facts about the French electoral system:  *This is France's ninth presidential election in the Fifth  Republic, dating to 1958.  *A candidate must win an absolute majority to be elected in the  first round. If no candidate achieves that, the top two candidates  will face each other in a second round May 6.  *The president's five-year term expires officially at midnight May  15.  If a new president is elected, the date of the inauguration  ceremony is traditionally set by agreement between the candidates.  -- Reuters Credit: By Kim Willsher, Special to Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrives at a campaign rally  Friday in Nice.

185,890023129.xml,"      With international pressure intensifying on European leaders,  their ability to take more aggressive action to corral an  escalating debt crisis is being hamstrung by public opposition to a  bigger bailout. Thursday offered a respite from bad news, as the central banks of  Britain, Japan, Switzerland and the United States joined with the  European Central Bank to grant European banks easier access to  cash. The banks have been pummeled by creditors wary of their  ability to pay back money because of their exposure to the massive  debts of countries such as Greece.   But there was no indication that the move would be more than a  short-term balm for the crisis engulfing the eurozone. U.S.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is to make a rare appearance  Friday at a meeting of European finance ministers in Poland, where  he is expected to urge his counterparts to follow through on their  pledges to provide Greece with a second installment of aid that  would allow the government to pay its bills.   The package for Greece has been met with hostility from taxpayers  and politicians from Finland to Austria and the Netherlands. But  the most serious discontent festers in Germany, the economic engine  of Europe and the key to resolving the crisis.   World leaders and the financial markets want Berlin to bring more  of its economic might to bear on digging cash-strapped countries  out of near-bankruptcy in order to prevent an implosion of the  eurozone. Among the measures being proposed is the creation of  ""eurobonds,"" or debt jointly issued by all 17 countries of the  currency-sharing zone.   But the prospect of assuming greater responsibility for the debts  of others horrifies a swath of the German population. Surveys show  about three-quarters of Germans oppose spending another penny to  bail out neighbors.   That hostility leaves Chancellor Angela Merkel with a dilemma: The  world expects her to save the euro currency. But in Germany the  more prevalent mood is: Enough is enough.   In a speech Thursday in Frankfurt, Merkel acknowledged that her  country must be in the vanguard of the hunt for an answer to the  financial crisis sweeping the continent.   ""The euro provides for economic growth. It provides for jobs and so  for prosperity in Germany,"" she said. ""So it is completely clear  that Germany ... has a duty and responsibility to make its  contribution to securing the euro's future and strengthening  Europe.""   But she warned against looking for a ""thunderbolt"" solution  to  wipe out problems in a single stroke, a  rebuke to those advocating  eurobonds, major fiscal harmonization of national economies and  other broad proposals.   The seemingly irreconcilable demands on Merkel from German voters  and from the rest of the world have left her struggling to find a  way forward and her party flailing at the polls.   Her Christian Democrats have lost one high-profile state election  after another in recent months, including the state that is home to  her own parliamentary seat. Although domestic issues played a large  role in those defeats, unhappiness that some of their hard-earned  euros are going to nations they regard as irresponsible has led  many Germans to turn their backs on Merkel's party.   ""The ongoing turbulence we've seen over the last 18 months is  certainly on voters' minds,"" said Joerg Rocholl, president and dean  of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin.  ""This has played against her.""   At the same time, Merkel is trying to tamp down a revolt brewing  within the ranks of her own ruling coalition by increasingly vocal  ""Euroskeptics,"" who reflect the public's aversion to spending more  money on bailouts.   She appeared to be caught off guard this week when Philipp Roesler,  her economic minister and the leader of the coalition's junior  party, wrote in a German newspaper that a default by Greece was not  out of the question, contradicting Merkel's oft-stated position  that nothing of the sort could happen.   Her allies have accused Roesler of trying to capitalize on  populist, anti-bailout sentiment in order to prop up his foundering  Free Democrats in advance of elections in Berlin.   That fractiousness within her government has sometimes handcuffed  Merkel, to the disappointment of outsiders who expect her to make  bold, unilateral decisions on the European stage.   Merkel's defenders point out that she can hardly be the leader of  Europe if she can't hold on to her job as leader of Germany.   Ulrike Guerot, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on  Foreign Relations in Berlin, is convinced that Merkel is committed  to saving the euro and that she is even willing to move toward  greater European fiscal harmonization and joint debt. But trying to  nudge her compatriots to the same conclusion takes time.   ""This woman knows what she's doing. She just does it not at the  pace that the financial markets expect her to do it,"" Guerot said.  ""You first need to get the whole country (used) to the idea that we  change to a collective-debt-backed community.""   But many analysts say Merkel has not been forceful enough in  impressing upon Germans how dire the situation is and how important  it is for their country that the euro survive.   The German economy has benefited immensely from the single  currency, whose value has made the country's exports more  competitive than they would have been with the old, expensive  deutsche mark.   Failure of the euro, or even of Greece by itself, could  set back  economic growth.   ""They have tried to get that message across, but not always in a  convincing fashion,"" said Henrik Enderlein, associate dean of the  Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ""This is a complex issue,  and political leaders need to convince the population of what is  best.""   Merkel's immediate battle is to secure passage in the parliament  this month of an expanded European rescue fund that would provide  the crucial, second bailout package to Athens. Eurozone leaders  agreed to the fund in July, but it is subject to approval by each  nation's lawmakers.   Rocholl said the expanded fund would almost certainly be approved  by the Bundestag. But the problem is that the necessary votes for  it might come from opposition parties, not from within Merkel's  coalition.   That would constitute a major humiliation for Germany's first  female chancellor. ""It would signal a major lack of credibility,""  Rocholl said. ""It's a nervous and volatile environment.""  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is navigating global  expectations that her nation take the lead in helping to stabilize  the Greek economy and internal frustration that is causing voters  to turn away from her party.

186,1980707494.xml,"Who is the leader of the free world? Important as the question sounds, I'm beginning to wonder if it's better left unanswered.
The U.S. president is no longer the obvious choice. Even the new U.S. national security strategy, filled with bombastic statements such as ""the whole world is lifted by America's renewal and the re-emergence of American leadership,"" acknowledges growing competition among powers. And of course ""America first"" is the slogan of a national, not a global, leader.
So who, if not Donald Trump, qualifies for the job? Let's first consider its history.
The origin of the term ""leader of the free world"" is somewhat uncertain. Dominic Tierney of The Atlantic tracked it back to a 1948 New York Times article, in which British economist Barbara Ward called upon the U.S. to lead the West in fighting the communist threat. But a Google Books search suggests the title was first used during World War I and has made regular appearances in English-language books since the late 1930s. In any case, its use surged at the peak of the Cold War in the early 1960s (when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev began referring to ""the free world"" with heavy irony), declined toward the detente of the mid-1970s, then gained again through the Soviet Union's collapse and up until its last peak in 2007, just before the global financial crisis.
Typically applied to the U.S. president, the title has acquired a bitterly ironic flavor since the election of Trump, who studies suggest is broadly mistrusted in democratic countries. As a result, some pundits have been discussing whether a more globally respected politician, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could take over the role. As recently as September, Hillary Clinton called her ""the most important leader in the free world right now.""
Merkel, however, probably doesn't fit the bill. Weakened by the last election, she has found herself embroiled in the longest coalition talks in Germany's post-World War II history. Even if she's back on top by Easter, global leadership will be pretty far from her mind as she settles into what's likely to be her last term in power. She doesn't even have an obvious successor in her party. Besides, she has always shown much more interest in shaping the European Union to Germany's benefit than in leading the world, free or otherwise.
Other European leaders don't qualify, either. Almost all lead precarious, painstakingly built coalitions with domestically focused agendas, while others — mostly in Eastern Europe — aren't interested in being part of any liberal order. The only notable exception is French President Emmanuel Macron, mockingly called ""Jupiter"" and compared to the Sun King by his compatriots. But, at 40 and in his first year as an elected official, he's unproven. Also, France has been in the doldrums for too long and has too many institutional and economic problems to be a credible global leader.
Top EU officials could take a shot. The European project unites most established democracies, is the world's biggest trade bloc and has a consistent track record of defending liberal values. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, besides being something of a comical pair, have proved powerless even to bring the EU closer together. They're negotiators and compromise-makers, not leaders. And the EU, for all its economic power, is a peace project, so its role in resolving global conflicts will remain minimal.
One could make a case for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He's a liberal favorite, branded ""the free world's best hope"" by Rolling Stone. He acts the part, emphasizing his differences with Trump on immigration, climate change and gender equality. He has also boosted Canada's military spending. But it wouldn't be easy for Canada to emerge from the shadow of the U.S., and Trudeau isn't particularly popular with Canadians (his approval rating just slipped below 50 percent).
There still is a free world, in which citizens elect political leaders rather than tolerate authoritarian succession as in China or Russia. It doesn't, however, appear to have a credible leader — one who would be both powerful and committed to clear, attractive values.
Moreover, it's hard to see where one would come from. The U.S. will be eyed with mistrust after Trump. Its values are in flux and hard for outsiders to understand, and its military power is not necessarily relevant to modern conflicts, as Europe's Middle Eastern refugee crisis has demonstrated. Germany, for its part, is weighed down by its history and held together by a rebuilt communitarian tradition, in which leadership-hungry politicians are unlikely to flourish.
The question, then, is whether the free world needs a leader. Perhaps the path forward requires collective decisions and compromises, inclusiveness and consensus, negotiation and civilized debate. It sounds boring, even weak, and the outcomes may often appear suboptimal, but freedom and strong leadership have always been a little at odds. Quiet, soft power as practiced by European nations, Canada and Japan might work better as an advertisement for democracy than U.S. assertiveness has since the end of the Cold War.

She said the country's cyberdefense agency was investigating.Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said an initial analysis suggests that the material was obtained from cloud services, email accounts or social networks. He said there was no indication that federal government or parliament computer systems were compromised.The German news agency dpa reported that the information included a fax number and email address belonging to Merkel and several letters to and from the chancellor.Although the data reportedly include information such as internal party communications and in some cases personal financial records and credit card details -- some of the data years old -- RBB said there appeared to be no politically sensitive documents.The Twitter account listed as located in Hamburg was taken offline at midday Friday after gaining about 17,000 followers. Appeals court backs president in transgender military caseWASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court in Washington sided with the Trump administration Friday, saying restrictions on transgender men and women serving in the military can stand.The decision lifted an injunction that had barred the government from limiting their service.The unsigned order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has no immediate impact on transgender troops because federal judges in three other cases have temporarily prevented the administration from implementing its policy.The Defense Department said it is continuing to abide by the other court orders that allow transgender men and women to enlist and serve.Even so, the five-page ruling was a blow to the civil rights and gay rights organizations challenging the policy nationwide. China begins first surface exploration of moon's far sideBEIJING -- A Chinese space rover explored the lunar terrain on Friday in the world's first mission on the surface of the far side of the moon.Jade Rabbit 2 drove off a ramp the previous night and onto the soft, powdery surface after a Chinese spacecraft made the first-ever soft landing on the moon's far side. A photo by China's space agency showed tracks left by the rover as it headed away from the spacecraft.The Chinese rover has six powered wheels, allowing it to continue to operate even if one wheel fails. It has a maximum speed of about 200 meters per hour and can climb a 20-degree hill or an obstacle up to 8 inches tall.Previous moon landings have been on the near side of the moon, which faces Earth. The far side has never been explored on the surface. U.S.: Airstrike targeted militant tied to USS Cole bombingWASHINGTON -- An American airstrike earlier this week targeted an al-Qaida operative accused of involvement in the attack nearly two decades ago on the USS Cole that killed 17 sailors, a U.S. military spokesman said Friday.The man targeted, Jamal al-Badawi, is wanted in the United States for his role in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack on the guided-missile destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden. He was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in 2003 and charged with 50 counts of various terrorism offenses, including murder of U.S. nationals and murder of U.S. military personnel.The spokesman said the airstrike was conducted Tuesday in the governate of Marib, which is east of Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, and that U.S. forces are assessing results to confirm al-Badawi's death. Dozens of tourists robbed on trail to Rio landmarkSAO PAULO -- Dozens of tourists hiking toward the famous Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro were held at gunpoint for up to two hours in a mass robbery that could mark an early test for anti-crime crackdowns promised by Brazil's new president.Police said Friday that at least three assailants carrying knives and a gun set up the ambush on the trail, which cuts through a dense forest that borders a slum on the outskirts of the city and has been the site of numerous muggings.More than 30 people were robbed -- about half foreigners from Asia, Europe and elsewhere in South America -- as the thieves took hostages and waited for more tourists to arrive.They took cellphones, cameras, wedding rings and credit cards, police said, adding that nobody was hurt. Weather Channel app sold users' data, suit saysLOS ANGELES -- People relied on the most popular mobile weather app to make plans and figure out how to dress for the elements, but its owners used it to track their every step and profit off that information, Los Angeles prosecutors said Friday.The operator of The Weather Channel mobile app misled users who agreed to share their location information, selling their data to third parties, City Attorney Michael Feuer said.Feuer sued the app's operator in Los Angeles County Superior Court to stop the practice.A spokesman for IBM Corp., which owns the app, said it has always been clear about the use of location data collected from users.The Weather Channel app claims it has approximately 45 million users a month, the lawsuit said.

Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who has served in Congress for nearly four decades and recently shepherded a sweeping farm bill to passage, announced Friday that he will not seek re-election in 2020 at the end of his fourth term, opening up a seat the GOP has held for nearly a century.

188,879462824.xml,"      No one was surprised to learn that the perpetrator of last week's  devastating attacks in Norway was a religious fanatic. The religion  he embraced, however, shocked many in Europe and the United States. Norwegian police are describing Anders Behring Breivik, the  fair-haired native son who went on a shooting rampage at a youth  camp after bombing a government building in Oslo, as a ""right-wing  Christian fundamentalist.""  To a Western world that equates religious extremism with Islam,  this conclusion serves as a grim reminder that any religion can be  used to justify terrorism.  In a rambling, 1,500-page manifesto, Breivik explained his actions  as necessary to prevent the ""Islamization of Europe.""  He blamed Norway's Labor government for allowing immigration, hence  his attack on the Labor prime minister and the Labor youth camp.  Like Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City  bombing in 1995, Breivik has shown no remorse for what he has done.  Such disregard for life stems from the dehumanization of others,  which easily arises from a warped theology that divides people into  ""them and us.""  Ironically, Breivik's rant reads just like Osama bin Laden's 1998  fatwa titled ""Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,"" which called on  Muslims to kill Americans whenever and wherever possible,  regardless of age, gender or combatant status.  Breivik's actions also mimicked those of Zionist extremist Baruch  Goldstein. Convinced that all territory ruled by the biblical King  David belongs to modern Israel, Goldstein wanted to clear the West  Bank of its Palestinian inhabitants. One Friday in 1994, he entered  a mosque in Hebron and murdered 29 Muslims at prayer. His settler  community still considers him a hero and has erected a monument in  his honor. Religious fanaticism makes for strange bedfellows,  indeed.  Many on the religious right will object to Breivik being  characterized as a ""Christian fundamentalist terrorist."" They will  dismiss him as a deranged individual, not a true practitioner of  their faith, and resent any criticism of fundamentalism. Deranged  he certainly was, for no normal person could slaughter 68 teenagers  and young adults in cold blood and feel no remorse. His personal  pathology notwithstanding, it is still profoundly disturbing that  he should find ideological justification for his hatred within  Christianity. When conservative theology melds with right-wing  political rhetoric, it almost always creates a volatile mix that  under the wrong circumstances can be deadly.  In Europe, the cultural nationalists provide grist for the  extremists' mill. They insist that Muslim immigrants threaten  Europe's Christian identity, even though fewer than 15 percent of  Europeans in most countries attend church. The opposition of many  Germans to the Cologne mosque and the French ban on hijabs  (headscarves) in schools and public buildings are cases in point.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel's statement that ""multiculturalism  has failed,"" soon echoed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and  British Prime Minister David Cameron, adds fuel to the flames.  Norway's right-wing Progress Party, to which Breivik once belonged,  garnered 22 percent of the vote in the last election.  A different vitriolic mix stirs passions in the U.S. After 9/11,  condemnation of Islam blended with Christian fundamentalism and  xenophobia focused on illegal Mexican immigrants to produce a  profound distrust of anyone deemed an outsider. Popular pundits and  conservative talk-show hosts spew this inflammatory rhetoric, which  attracts large audiences. Rather than repudiate these dangerous  ideas, some politicians actually use them to mobilize voters.  The 242 percent increase in militia groups nationwide since 2008  attests to the potential danger of fomenting a paranoid ideology  that sees enemies around every corner. If this demonization of  others continues, we can expect to see the likes of Anders Behring  Breivik again.  ---------- Tom Mockaitis is a history professor at DePaul University and  author of ""The 'New' Terrorism: Myths and Reality.""

189,1917120697.xml,"President Donald Trump's signature slogan -- ""America First"" -- lately has gotten a tweak from administration aides eager to show that his nationalism is not at odds with the United States' traditional global leadership role. Their new version: ""America first does not mean America alone."" Yet America was undeniably alone as Trump on Saturday departed the annual summit of the Group of 20 leaders in Hamburg, Germany. With the leaders' final statement, it was evident that Trump's prioritization of American self-interest -- on environmental agreements, trade, migration and more -- left him, and thus America, often in unfamiliar isolation.After two days of cordial smiles and handshakes, Trump expressed satisfaction with the summit. Even so, he was alone among leaders of the world's major economic powers in dissenting from its resolution affirming the Paris climate accord. And while he has threatened to abandon trade deals and penalize countries for what he sees as unfair trade practices, particularly on steel exports, the summit's closing declaration affirmed support for open markets and fighting protectionism.After the more exclusive Group of 7 summit in May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had described the meeting as ""six against one"" -- the one being the United States. As she closed the G-20 gathering that she hosted, Merkel again singled out the United States.In a news conference, Merkel said she ""deplores"" America's decision to walk away from the Paris climate agreement and, despite Trump's comments, does not believe the administration is open to renegotiating the terms agreed to among more than 190 nations to mitigate the effects of climate change.Merkel, as she has before, called on European countries to step into the vacuum that Trump is leaving on the world stage.""We as Europeans have to take our fate into our own hands,"" she said.The new French president, Emmanuel Macron, who will host Trump this week in Paris to mark Bastille Day, echoed Merkel. ""The world has never been so divided,"" he said.In another break from past decades, the United States seemed closer to Russia -- in goodwill if not on many issues -- than with traditional allies such as Germany and France after Trump's genial tete-a-tete with President Vladimir Putin on Friday.Trump's meeting with Putin, lasting more than two hours, was his longest with any leader. He raised Americans' concerns over Russian election meddling, according to aides, but the two presidents decided to put the matter behind them and move on to discuss how they can address their differences over Syria, Ukraine and North Korea.Unlike many other leaders, Trump didn't hold a news conference at the conclusion as Americans presidents typically have done. Putin, in his meeting with reporters, denied again -- as he did to Trump on Friday -- that Russia interfered in the U.S. election, and said he thinks that Trump accepted his face-to-face denials.White House officials declined to challenge Putin's view that Trump accepted his denials when questioned on Air Force One en route back to Washington.Trump ""will be happy to make statements himself"" about his meeting with Putin, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.He and Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, were sanguine about the summit's results, and singled out as constructive the leaders' discussions about dumping of cheap raw materials, limiting migration, and cracking down on terrorist financing.""These things are never easy -- to get 20 of your friends to agree where to have dinner tonight is really hard -- but I thought the communique came together pretty reasonably,"" Cohn said.For nearly three-quarters of a century, since World War II, the United States has been the pre-eminent leader in championing open markets and forging a multilateral system of rules to resolve international disputes.Trump has repeatedly signaled his skepticism of multilateral institutions like the European Union and forums like the G-20. In Hamburg, rather than using the conference to build broad consensus around his populist ideas, he spent most of his time in private one-on-one discussions with leaders.The president often retreated from the group's larger sessions in favor of such bilateral meetingsTrump and the other leaders of the G-20 signed off on a joint statement that was seen as an accomplishment given the sharp differences and acrimony.""We have a G-20 communique, not a G-19 communique,"" said one EU official after all-night negotiations to finesse the divisions. But the language on climate change, at least, made plain that the statement was in fact a G-19 communique, with the U.S. alone in opposition.Despite friction with Merkel, Trump thanked her Saturday for hosting the summit even as protesters clashed violently with police at times.""You have been amazing, and you have done a fantastic job,"" he said.----------brian.bennett@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction with the G-20 summit of economic powers, which ended Saturday.

190,1873994054.xml,"Banksy's art fills Bethlehem hotel with world's 'worst view'BETHLEHEM, West Bank -- A Palestinian guesthouse packed with  artwork of the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy unveiled  itself Friday in Bethlehem, with a sneak peek of what the owner  sarcastically called the ""hotel with the worst view in the world.""Wisam Salsaa, 42, said the nine-room establishment named ""The  Walled Off Hotel"" will officially open March 11, but he offered  reporters a tour of the hotel looking at the West Bank separation  barrier erected by Israel to ward off potential Palestinian  attackers.The hotel, several of whose rooms look onto an Israeli security  watchtower, is awash in the trademark satirical work of the  mysterious artist. The highlight is room No. 3, known as ""Banksy's  Room,"" where guests sleep in a king-size bed underneath Banksy's  artwork showing a Palestinian and an Israeli in a pillow fight.The hotel also features a presidential suite and a museum with the  artist's politically-charged work. It has the markings of a  gentleman's club from the English colonial period. The entrance to  one small niche accommodates a life-size figure of Arthur James  Balfour signing his 1917 letter that came to be known as the  Balfour declaration, and was the basis for the international push  for the creation of Israel.The cheapest rooms are $30 a night.The project took 14 months to complete and was kept under secrecy,  in accordance with Banksy's request to protect his anonymity. His  artwork comments on war, child poverty and the environment. His  works have fetched as much as $1.8 million at auctions.Experts unearth mass grave at former orphanage in IrelandDUBLIN -- A mass grave containing the remains of babies and young  children has been discovered at a former Catholic orphanage in  Ireland, government-appointed investigators announced Friday in a  finding that offered the first conclusive proof following a  historian's efforts to trace the fates of nearly 800 children who  perished there.The commission said excavations since November at the site had  found an underground structure divided into 20 chambers containing  ""significant quantities of human remains.""The commission said DNA analysis confirmed the ages of the dead  ranged from 35 weeks to 3 years old and were buried chiefly in the  1950s, when the facility was one of over a dozen in Ireland  offering shelter to orphans, unwed mothers and their children. The  Tuam home closed in 1961.White House eyes deep cuts to key climate science agencyWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to  slash one of the government's premier climate science agencies by  17 percent, delivering steep cuts to research funding and satellite  programs, according to a four-page budget memo obtained by The  Washington Post.The proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration would also eliminate funding for a variety of  smaller programs including external research, coastal management,  estuary reserves and ""coastal resilience,"" which seeks to bolster  the ability of coastal areas to withstand major storms and rising  seas.A White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity said  that the budget process was ""evolving"" and cautioned against citing  specific numbers.1,300 suspected militants held in Pakistani sweep, police sayLAHORE, Pakistan -- About 1,300 suspected militants were arrested  in a sweep of hideouts in Pakistan's largest province of Punjab,  police said Friday.The roughly two-week operation comes despite the provincial law  minister's defense of some groups designated as terrorist  organizations and banned by Pakistan but resurrected under new  names.Rana Sanaullah also embraced some sectarian leaders whose groups  have been accused of fomenting violence against minority Islamic  sects, raising questions about his commitment to ridding Punjab of  militants.Two police officials said another 36 militants died in shootouts  with police and in paramilitary operations since the sweep began  last month.Trump, Merkel to meet March 14 at White HouseWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will meet with German  Chancellor Angela Merkel later this month at the White House.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the meeting will take  place March 14. It will be the first in-person meeting between  Trump and the German chancellor since the U.S. election in  November.Trump frequently criticized Merkel during his presidential  campaign, accusing her of ""ruining Germany"" by taking in large  numbers of refugees.Merkel, who wields significant sway in Europe, was critical of  Trump's refugee and immigration travel ban against seven  Muslim-majority nations -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria  and Yemen.The ban was blocked by the courts.Sanders did not offer details on what the two may discuss.Despite vow, Keystone pipe won't use U.S. steel after allPALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Keystone XL oil pipeline won't use American  steel in its construction, despite what President Donald Trump  says.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that's  due to language in a presidential directive Trump issued in  January. The directive applies to new pipelines or those under  repair. Sanders said it would be hard to do an about-face on  Keystone because it's already under construction.Trump said as recently as last week that Keystone and the Dakota  Access pipeline must use American steel ""or we're not building  one.""The Keystone pipeline would run from Canada to refineries in the  Gulf Coast. The Dakota Access line would move North Dakota oil to  Illinois, and that project is nearly complete.Reporter killed: Two attackers on a motorcycle gunned down Mexican  reporter Cecilio Pineda Birto in the southern state of Guerrero,  authorities said Friday, in what is considered one of the world's  most dangerous countries for journalists.

191,2575218743.xml,"Hibaja Maai gave birth three days after arriving in Germany.  She had fled the bombs that destroyed her home in Syria and crossed the black waters of the Mediterranean on a rickety boat with her three young children. In Greece, a doctor urged her to stay put, but she pressed on, through Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria.Only after she had crossed the border into Bavaria did she relax and almost immediately go into labor.""It's a girl,"" the doctor said when he handed her the newborn bundle.There was no question in Maai's mind what her daughter's name would be.""We are calling her Angela,"" she told her husband, who had fled six months earlier and was reunited with his family two days before Angela's birth on Feb. 1, 2016.""Angela Merkel saved our lives,"" Maai said in a recent interview in her new hometown, Wulfrath, in northwestern Germany. ""She gave us a roof over our heads, and she gave a future to our children. We love her like a mother.""Chancellor Angela Merkel is stepping down after her replacement is chosen following Germany's election Sunday. Her decision to welcome more than 1 million refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in 2015 and 2016 stands as perhaps the most consequential moment of her 16 years in power.It changed Europe, changed Germany, and changed the lives of those seeking refuge, a debt acknowledged by families who named their newborns after her in gratitude.The chancellor has no children of her own. But in different corners of Germany, there are now 5- and 6-year-old girls (and some boys) who carry variations of her name -- Angela, Angie, Merkel and even Angela Merkel. How many is impossible to say. The New York Times has identified nine, but social workers suggest there could be far more, each of them now calling Germany home.""She will only eat German food!"" said Maai of little Angela, now 5.The fall of 2015 was an extraordinary moment of compassion and redemption for the country that committed the Holocaust. Many Germans call it their ""fall fairy tale."" But it also set off years of populist blowback, emboldening illiberal leaders like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and catapulting a far-right party into Germany's own parliament for the first time since World War II.Today, European border guards are using force against migrants. Refugee camps linger in squalor. And European leaders pay Turkey and Libya to stop those in need from attempting the journey at all. During the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a chorus of Europeans was quick to assert that refugees would not be welcome.Having fled war, torture and chaos in Syria, Mhmad and Widad now live on Sunshine Street in the western German city of Gelsenkirchen. In their third-floor living room, a close-up of Merkel's smiling face is the screen saver on the large flat-screen television, a constant presence.""She is our guardian angel,"" said Widad, a 35-year-old mother of six, who asked that she and her family members be identified only by their first names to protect relatives in Syria. ""Angela Merkel did something big, something beautiful, something Arabic leaders did not do for us.""""We have nothing to pay her back,"" she added. ""So we named our daughter after her.""Angela, or Angie as her parents call her, is now 5. An animated girl with large hazel eyes and cascading curls, Angie loves to tell stories, in German, with her five siblings. Her sister Haddia, 13, wants to be a dentist. Fatima, 11, loves math.""There is no difference between boys and girls in school here, and that is good,"" Widad said. ""I hope Angie will grow up to be like Ms. Merkel: a strong woman with a big heart.""The arrival of nearly 1 million refugees shook Germany, even as Merkel rallied the nation with a simple pledge: ""We can manage this."" Like many others, Widad and her family were granted subsidiary protection status, in 2017, which allows them to stay and work in Germany. In three years, they will apply for German citizenship.The latest government statistics show that migrants who arrived in 2015 and 2016 are steadily integrating into German society. One in two have jobs. More than 65,000 are enrolled either in university or apprenticeship programs. Three in four live in their own apartments or houses and say they feel ""welcome"" or ""very welcome.""During the pandemic, refugees sewed masks and volunteered to go shopping for elderly Germans isolated at home. During the recent floods in western Germany, refugees drove to the devastated areas to help clean up.""They come to me and say they want to give something back,"" said Marwan Mohamed, a social worker in Gelsenkirchen for the Catholic charity Caritas.A vicar's daughter, Merkel grew up behind the Iron Curtain in Communist East Germany, a background that has profoundly impacted her politics.""She was clear: We won't build new borders in Europe. She lived half her life behind one,"" recalled Thomas de Maizière, who served as Merkel's interior minister during the migrant crisis.Not everyone has agreed. The migration crisis unleashed an angry backlash, especially in Merkel's native former East Germany. This is where Berthe Mballa settled in 2015. She had been sent to the eastern city of Eberswalde by German migration officials, who used a formula to distribute asylum-seekers across the country.""The East is bad,"" one immigration lawyer told her. ""You got unlucky.""In 2013, Mballa fled violence in Cameroon with a map of the world and the equivalent of 20 euros. She had to leave behind two young children, one of whom has since gone missing, and the trauma is so searing that she cannot bring herself to speak of it.The first time she had ever heard Angela Merkel's name was on the Moroccan-Spanish border.""The Europeans had built big fences so the Africans wouldn't come in,"" she recalled. ""I saw the people on the African side shouting her name, hundreds of them, 'Merkel, Merkel, Merkel.' ""Since settling in Eberswalde, Mballa has been insulted on the street and spat at on a bus. Merkel is loathed by many voters in this region, yet Mballa did not hesitate to name her son, born after she arrived in Germany, ""Christ Merkel"" -- ""because Merkel is my savior.""""One day my son will ask me why he is called Merkel,"" she said. ""When he is bigger, I will tell him my whole story, how hard it was, how I suffered, the pregnancy, my arrival here, the hope and the love that this woman gave me.""CAPTION: Photo: Angela Al Abdi, named for Chancellor Merkel, plays on the slide at a playground Aug. 25 in Wulfrath, Germany.

192,762263426.xml,"      Greece on Wednesday began suspending all overseas air shipments for 48 hours, screening thousands of packages and launching a manhunt for local militants believed to have orchestrated a campaign to send parcel bombs to embassies in Athens, international organizations and European leaders. Authorities said the suspension came after a parcel bomb reached the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. A second, addressed to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, caught fire as officials handled it at Bologna airport in Italy. In addition, two parcel bombs were detonated in the cargo section of the Athens airport, officials said. Other bombs detected in Athens were destined for the embassies of Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Switzerland. None of the parcels caused serious injuries and none examined by investigators contained lethal amounts of explosives, authorities said. Greek National Police Chief Lefteris Economou said the cases in Greece did not appear to be related to the incidents last week in which two U.S.-bound airplanes from Yemen were found to be carrying powerful explosives in a plot apparently tied to al-Qaida. ""There is not a shred of evidence suggesting al-Qaida involvement,"" he said. ""It all appears to be local and part of the terrorists' agenda to stir trouble."" With municipal elections scheduled Sunday and ruling socialists expected to suffer huge losses, pundits and politicians expressed concern that the parcel bombs could intensify political tensions. Two men were arrested this week and charged on suspicion of sending a parcel bomb and planning attacks against embassies and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. State security officials said Wednesday that the younger of the two suspects -- a 20-year-old chemistry student -- ranked among the most wanted members of the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire, a militant anti-authority movement known as SPF. Authorities are seeking at least five other group members believed to have assisted in the letter-bomb campaign. The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire burst onto Greece's terror scene in 2008, waging 18 small-scale bomb attacks in the span of 30 minutes. ""Their choice of targets this time around was emblematic of their intent,"" said John Brady Kiesling, a former U.S. diplomat and authority on Greek terrorism. ""They clearly wanted to internationalize their cause and send a message of solidarity to countries where anarchists are currently imprisoned."" - - - E.U. pressed on security BERLIN -- A German government source said European Union interior ministers plan to discuss next week how to respond to two recent spates of parcel bombs.

193,418735649.xml,"      Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats on Tuesday named the man he handpicked as the party's new leader amid calls for revitalizing the party by promoting younger members and more women. The party's executive committee voted unanimously, with one abstention, to recommend as chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble. A final vote in which Schaeuble is expected to be confirmed is scheduled for a Nov. 7 party convention. Schaeuble, also re-elected as parliamentary faction leader Tuesday, said he looked forward to leading a ""critical, fighting, self-confident"" opposition party. Germany's outgoing conservative government, meanwhile, claimed credit for the lowest jobless figure in nearly two years. But the incoming center-left coalition said the 3.96 million unemployed were still too many. Unemployment nationwide averages 10.3 percent, down from 11.2 percent this time last year, the Federal Labor Office said. The choice of Schaeuble as the Christian Democrats' new leader came despite criticism from some party members that a bolder break from Kohl was needed. In last month's election, Kohl led the Christian Democrats to the party's worst showing in 50 years. Kohl insisted there was no bitterness during the closed meeting. He said there was no discussion about an official, future role for him in the party. The CDU has dominated German postwar politics by attracting a wide range of conservative voters. But young members worry it lost touch with the national mood during Kohl's 25-year chairmanship and his 16 years as chancellor. Saxony state Gov. Kurt Biedenkopf, a longtime Kohl critic, said he abstained in voting for Schaeuble because he didn't think one person should head both the party and the parliamentary faction, as Kohl did. But outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, believed to have wanted the party's top job for himself, backed off his earlier criticism of Kohl's push for Schaeuble. ""We're on a good path toward the right generational mix,"" Ruehe said. He is among five candidates running for four deputy positions next month at the convention. Only one candidate is a woman--Kohl's outgoing Environment Minister Angela Merkel. Rita Suessmuth, a Christian Democrat who will lose her post as parliamentary president, called for the party to bring more women to top posts. Also Tuesday, a Greens leader said the environmental party will get at least two posts, foreign minister and environment minister, in Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet. Juergen Trittin will be in the environment post, said Gunda Roestel, who leads the Greens Party with Trittin. Joschka Fischer, a co-leader of the Greens faction in parliament, will take over the Foreign Ministry.

194,1772681487.xml,"       A nationalist, anti-migration party powered into three German state legislatures in elections Sunday held amid divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal approach to the refugee crisis. The elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt were the first major political test since Germany registered nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers last year.  The 3-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, easily entered all three legislatures.  AfD won 15.1 percent of the vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg and 12.6 percent in Rhineland-Palatinate, official results showed. It finished second in Saxony-Anhalt with some 24 percent, according to projections.  ""We are seeing above all in these elections that voters are turning away in large numbers from the big established parties and voting for our party,"" AfD leader Frauke Petry said.  There were uncomfortable results for Germany's biggest parties -- Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democrats.  The CDU kept its status as strongest party in Saxony-Anhalt. It had hoped to beat left-leaning Green Party Gov. Winfried Kretschmann in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a traditional stronghold that the CDU ran for decades until 2011. It also hoped to oust Social Democrat Gov. Malu Dreyer in Rhineland-Palatinate.  But the CDU finished several percentage points behind the popular incumbents' parties and dropped 12 percentage points to a record-low result in Baden-Wuerttemberg, with 27 percent support. Its performance in Rhineland-Palatinate, with 31.8 percent, was also a record low.  The Social Democrats suffered large losses in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony-Anhalt, where they were the junior partners in the outgoing governments, finishing behind AfD.  In all three states, the results were set to leave the outgoing coalition governments without a majority -- forcing regional leaders into what could be time-consuming negotiations with new, unusual partners.

195,1841722043.xml,"       German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday announced her intention to seek a fourth term in office. Merkel, 62, is Europe's most influential leader, a political centrist in the vein of President Barack Obama, her close and longtime ally. Her stature and diplomatic clout -- along with her strong stance on equality and tolerance -- have led observers to call her a potential counterpoint to rising nationalism and populism on both sides of the Atlantic.   Merkel on Sunday said she was flattered by those calling for her to assume the global mantle of liberal democracy after Obama's departure. But she also called it ""grotesque"" and ""absurd"" to assume that one person can make a difference in a rapidly changing world.   Speaking about a global situation that is ""realigning"" after Donald Trump's election, particularly in regard to Russia, she said, ""No person alone, not even the most experienced, can turn things to good in Germany, Europe and the world, especially not a chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.""   Nevertheless, Merkel said, she had made a decision to run again after ""endless deliberation,"" in part to work in favor of political dialogue that is not characterized by ""hate."" She seemed to suggest no other candidate could serve as a match for these ""insecure times.""   ""People would have little understanding if I would not again bring to bear all the gifts and talents which were given to me to do my duty for Germany,"" she said at the party headquarters of her center-right Christian Democrats in Berlin.   By merely announcing, Merkel becomes the early favorite if not a shoe-in to win next year's vote, a triumph that would make her Germany's longest serving leader since Helmut Kohl presided over German reunification and the end of the Cold War.   But the methodical Merkel will also find herself swimming against the tide of resurgent nationalism, including in Germany. Although buoyed by this nation's vast economic strength, she faces a serious backlash from her decision last year to take in nearly a million refugees from the Middle East. She must also contend with voter fatigue with political elites and incumbents.   Merkel, a pragmatist raised in former communist East Germany, was a trained physicist who became Europe's decider. She has guided Germany to the height of its post-World War II clout, but has done so in a non-threatening way that has almost always emphasized consensus building.   Merkel is no stranger to crisis -- having, for better or worse, shouldered the brunt of Europe's handling of the Greek debt crisis, as well as the standoff with Moscow over its intervention in Ukraine. But victory would mean difficult new challenges for Merkel -- most importantly how to move forward with Britain's vote to exit from the European Union without tearing the bloc apart.   And if Marine Le Pen, from France's far-right National Front, stages an upset in next year's elections in France, Merkel would find herself -- and her centrist politics -- more regionally isolated than ever before.   On the plus side, Merkel still enjoys enviable approval ratings of between 55 and 59 percent at home. But her popularity is no longer at the stratospheric levels seen years ago.   Although she has since toughened her stance on migrants, she has taken a hit over her handling of the refugee crisis.   The political fallout has played into the hands of the anti-establishment, far-right Alternative for Germany, an upstart party that has racked up wins in key local elections this year.

196,1015453759.xml,"      European leaders, at odds Wednesday over how to resolve the deepening crisis in the eurozone, have been advised by senior officials to prepare plans in case Greece quits the single currency area. Three officials said the instruction to be ready was agreed upon during a teleconference of the Eurogroup Working Group -- experts who work for the bloc's finance ministers -- and the German central bank said losing Greece would be challenging but ""manageable.""   ""The EWG agreed that each eurozone country should prepare a contingency plan, individually, for the potential consequences of a Greek exit from the euro,"" said one eurozone official.   The Greek finance ministry denied that there was any such agreement, but Belgian Finance Minister Steven Vanackere, asked by reporters ahead of the European Union summit, said: ""All the contingency plans come back to the same thing: To be responsible as a government is to foresee even what you hope to avoid.""   The news came at a highly sensitive time, as EU leaders gathered to try to breathe life into their struggling economies at a summit over dinner Wednesday.   Disagreements over measures to alleviate two years of debt turmoil had been laid bare before the meal.   Germany's Bundesbank said that the situation in Greece was ""extremely worrying"" and that the country was jeopardizing further financial aid by threatening not to implement reforms agreed as part of its two bailouts.   The Bundesbank said a euro exit would pose ""considerable but manageable"" challenges for its European partners, raising pressure on Athens to keep its painful economic reforms on track.   Greek officials have said that without outside funds, the country will run out of money within two months and that there remains the danger that if it crashes out of the eurozone, other member states could be targeted by the markets.   A German two-year debt auction Wednesday gave a stark illustration of how money is dashing for safe havens.   Investors snapped up the 4.5 billion euros of paper on offer even though it came with a nearly zero coupon -- offering virtually no return.   French President Francois Hollande's election victory has significantly changed the terms of the debate in Europe, with his call for greater emphasis on growth rather than debt-cutting now a rallying cry for other leaders.   Hollande has chosen to make a stand on euro bonds -- the idea of sharing eurozone debt -- despite consistent German opposition to the idea. He has support from Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, among others.   But German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed no sign of dropping her objections to the proposal, which she has said can only be discussed once there is much closer fiscal union in Europe.   Having rallied on Tuesday, European stocks dropped about 2 percent Wednesday as investors anticipated a lack of dramatic policy intervention at the summit.

197,1695969561.xml,"       After grueling, often angry negotiations that tested the limits of European unity, Greece struck a preliminary rescue deal with its creditors Monday that should avert an imminent financial catastrophe but also guarantees years of more hardship and sacrifice for its people. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras flew home to sell the bailout plan to skeptical lawmakers and political allies, some of whom accused him of selling Greece out. Panos Kammenos, leader of the junior partner in Tsipras' coalition government, denounced the deal as a German-led ""coup.""    ""This deal introduced many new issues ... we cannot agree with it,"" he said after meeting with Tsipras.    Other Greeks rallied Monday night before parliament in Athens, urging lawmakers to reject the new demands.    To close the deal with his partners in the euro currency, Tsipras had to consent to a raft of austerity measures, including sales tax hikes and pension and labor reforms -- measures he had campaigned vociferously against over the last five years of Greece's financial crisis.    Since his election in January, Tsipras has faced intense pressure to backpedal on many of his promises to Greece's exhausted electorate. Finally, faced Sunday by the leaders of the 18 other nations that share the euro and the knowledge that Greek banks were just days from running out of money, the moment came when he couldn't resist anymore.    A series of supposed ""red lines"" vanished, including objections to tight international oversight of Greece's economy, continued involvement by the International Monetary Fund in Greece's bailout program and cuts to pensions.    The result of marathon negotiations emerged Monday: about $95.1 billion in loans and financial support for Greece over three years that will preserve membership in the euro, shore up its banks and allow a modicum of stability to return to its battered economy.    Creditors have also dangled the carrot of a possible future debt restructuring in the event of a smooth bailout.    ""We managed to avoid the most extreme measures,"" Tsipras said.    But in many cases, ordinary Greeks now face tougher measures than those they voted down in a nationwide referendum a little over a week ago.    Syriza's Left Platform, a group of traditionalists in Tsipras' own party, swiftly denounced the agreement as the ""worst deal possible ... (one) that maintains the country's status: a debt colony under a German-run European Union.""    Financial experts themselves were divided over the result.    ""It was the best deal the Greeks could get,"" says Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They did not do too badly given the terrible, terrible, disastrous starting point the current government put them in.""    But Ashoka Mody, visiting professor of international finance at Princeton University, says the deal just repeats policies that have already failed.    ""The economics of this program have been set up for failure,"" he said. ""In three years, if this program is implemented, the Greek economy will be 10 percent smaller than it was and the debt burden will be higher.""    In many ways, Tsipras' hard work begins now. As part of the deal, his government has to get the Greek parliament to back a series of economic measures by Wednesday that creditors are demanding. And in the weeks to come, Greece will have to make further changes to its economy, such as opening to competition industries like energy that have long been protected.    ""Trust needs to be rebuilt,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding that with the deal ""Greece has a chance to return to the path of growth.""    Passage of the new measures appears assured, since Greece's opposition parties have pledged to support Tsipras' deal. But dissent within the ruling Syriza party is threatening his coalition, raising the prospect of some sort of national unity government or an early election later this year.    Greece needs another bailout, its third in five years, to cope with its mountain of debt and get its economy back on track after a six-year retreat that evokes memories of the 1930s' Great Depression. The Greek economy has been pushed to the brink of collapse -- banks have been shut down for two weeks, capital controls limit daily withdrawals to a paltry 60 euros, about $67, and normal business has almost ground to a halt.    When the Greek banks eventually reopen, they will most likely have to depend on more emergency credit from the European Central Bank.

198,1897291799.xml,"Every year on May 9, the Russian military puts on a display of  might dedicated to the Soviet Union's World War II victory. This  year's celebration was hyped in a banner headline on the Drudge  Report, a right-leaning U.S. news site, as an impressive show of  Russian President Vladimir Putin's power. Yet it took place under skies so overcast that the aerial part of  the spectacle had to be canceled. The symbolism is tacky but  uncanny: With European elections and Washington politics going the  way they are, Putin has little to celebrate.After a 2016 that promised so much -- with advances in Syria, a  Ukraine backsliding into a morass of hopeless corruption, the  defeat of Hillary Clinton in the U.S. and the impressive poll  standings of pro-Russian populists in Europe -- 2017 has been  disappointing for the Russian leader. President Donald Trump has  realized that any contact between his administration and Russia,  except the most perfunctory official kind, can undermine his  already shaky support within the Republican Party and spark  torrents of negative coverage in the mainstream media. In the  Netherlands, nationalist Geert Wilders lost to Prime Minister Mark  Rutte, whose anti-Putin stand echoes that of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel, herself confidently pursuing re-election. Ukraine  has received a $1 billion loan tranche from the International  Monetary Fund, and the European Union approved long-delayed  visa-free travel for Ukrainians -- sparking the jealousy of  Russians, who need to get visas.In Syria, a more active U.S. has made it difficult for Putin ally  Bashar Assad, Syria's president, to pursue further military  expansion, and talks between the regime and the opposition  sponsored by Russia and Turkey have bogged down. Putin is now  pushing a plan to effectively freeze the conflict by establishing  safe zones in opposition-held areas, a plan that appears also to be  favored by Trump but with strings attached -- the U.S. and the  anti-Assad forces don't want Iran to help enforce the safe zones.  Putin and Assad, who got a lot of help from Iran last year, are  finding it hard to accept that.The list growsIn recent months, Putin's attempt to drive up oil prices by  conducting a joint propaganda blitz with the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries to tout oil production cuts (from  unsustainable, record-high levels) has foundered. The price of  Brent oil is back below $50 per barrel, leaving Russians to  struggle with the same budgetary woes as last year.Finally, on Sunday, the French presidential election ended with the  victory of the most anti-Putin candidate in the field -- Emmanuel  Macron, who has accused Russia of mounting disinformation and  hacking campaigns against him, echoing Clinton in a way that must  have made Putin wince.Putin sent Macron a somewhat desperate-sounding congratulatory  telegram:""The citizens of France trusted you to lead the country in a period  that's difficult for Europe and for the entire global community.  The growing threats of terrorism and militant extremism are  accompanied by the escalation of local conflicts and the  destabilization of entire regions. Under these conditions, it's  especially important to overcome mutual distrust and combine  efforts to ensure international stability and security.""That's probably not what Macron wanted to hear in the flush of  electoral triumph, but the telegram echoes the analysis of Putin's  policy wonks who argue that the populist defeats in Europe are only  temporary. The Russian Institute of Strategic Studies, the  Kremlin-affiliated think tank, argued in an analysis of European  events this week that in the Netherlands, ""a populist defeated a  populist,"" and elsewhere in Europe, including France, political  systems are in flux and traditional parties are shattering.Fooling PutinThere are clearly forces in Putin's entourage that seek to convince  him that the West is still weakening and that establishment forces  are on the run. That's so 2016, though: The tide has turned and the  pro-globalization, pro-European Union forces are on the  counterattack, led by a confident Merkel and a lucky, enthusiastic  Macron. Whatever the divisions within Western democracies, they  don't benefit Putin. Even the populist forces that have triumphed  in the U.S., United Kingdom and eastern European countries such as  Poland are emphatically not his friends.I still am not certain Putin was behind the internet-based  campaigns against Clinton and Macron. But if indeed Russia has  meddled in Western elections to prove the shakiness of established  democracies, the short-term effect hasn't been worth it. Western  powers, led by leaders he considered weak such as Barack Obama and  France's Francois Hollande, may have looked like easy targets. By  smirking knowingly during their election turmoil, Putin maximized  credit as a global force to be reckoned with, though the gleeful  participation of Kremlin propaganda outlets has also made it  impossible for him to take nuanced positions. Arguably, he is now  more isolated than before the tumultuous European and U.S.  elections.As he made a speech at the Victory Day parade, Putin sounded like a  lonely man shouting in a desert:""Today, life itself required us to increase our defense potential.  But in order effectively to fight terrorism, extremism, neo-Nazism  and other threats, the consolidation of the entire international  community is necessary. We are open to such cooperation. Russia  will always be on the side of the forces of peace, those who choose  the path of equal partnership and reject wars as inimical to the  meaning of life and human nature.""To foreign leaders like Trump, Merkel and Macron, it must be hard  to make sense of Putin's call for cooperation. Not too long ago, he  was threatening them -- explicitly and implicitly -- with war if  they crossed him. What's changed besides Putin's string of losses?  The weather isn't good for further geopolitical games; there are no  more easy victories to distract Russians from the grim stagnation  at home.----------BloombergLeonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.

199,419921837.xml,"       Los Angeles Times Petra Falkenberg of the Times' Berlin bureau contributed to this report.    In a sign of how much his economic reforms have angered the liberal core of his party, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder surprised the nation Friday by taking a political gamble and resigning as leader of the Social Democrat Party.    The abrupt move marked the widening divide between one of Europe's oldest political parties and Schroeder's attempts to overhaul the nation's generous welfare state. The chancellor's plans to cut health and social programs are increasingly viewed as political liabilities for Social Democrats facing tough local elections later this year.    ""We have made up our minds for a division of labor,"" Schroeder said during a news conference at which he announced his resignation as chairman of the party, known as SPD. ""I will concentrate on my job as chancellor and chief of the government. . . . I am reluctantly giving up [my party post]. But it is in favor of the reform process in Germany.""    The political marriage between Schroeder and the Social Democrats began to fall apart publicly last summer. Much of the SPD blames the chancellor for betraying Social Democratic principles and catering to corporations and the wealthy. But faced with an 11 percent unemployment rate and a $54 billion federal debt, Schroeder said he was forced to undertake one of the most sweeping reform plans since World War II.    Schroeder's resignation as SPD chairman pleased the opposition Christian Democratic Union, or CDU. The conservative Christian Democrats had been chiding Schroeder for not being more aggressive on welfare reform in hopes that it would split their rival party.    CDU leaders and many political experts believe Schroeder's move to distance himself from the Social Democrats will hurt his base of support if he seeks re-election in 2006.    ""This is the beginning of the end of Chancellor Schroeder,"" said CDU leader Angela Merkel.    Heribert Prantl, political editor of the left-leaning newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, characterized Schroeder's decision this way: ""This was an act of desperation. It can mean the end of his chancellorship, not immediately but let's say by the end of the year.""    Opinion polls show that Schroeder's reforms--along with high unemployment and the SPD's low poll standings--are hurting the party. A recent survey found that only 26 percent of voters favor the SPD. Party officials fear that a further slip in the polls would damage their chances to retain a governing coalition with the Greens after the next federal elections.    The chancellor's reform plan, known as Agenda 2010, is outraging much of the public. Most Germans support reducing their costly welfare state, but every euro trimmed is met with clamor. Social Democrats are most upset by Schroeder's proposed reductions to worker compensation programs and a plan forcing Germans to pay the equivalent of $12.50 for their initial visit to a doctor.    Schroeder's successor will be Franz Muentefering, SPD leader in Germany's lower house of parliament. He said the party--whose membership since 1990 has dropped from 920,000 to 630,000--must move beyond animosity.

200,1841722133.xml,"       Angela Merkel took to Instagram on Nov. 9 to (sort of) congratulate President-elect Donald Trump. Instead of sending a direct message to @realdonaldtrump, Merkel posted her congratulations publicly to her followers, first in German, then later in English. Merkel's message was too long for Twitter, the former businessman's favored outlet. And, no, her message didn't contain the usual platitudes about undying friendship, not in the traditional sense, anyway. Rather, it was a conditional invitation, a message that stopped short of congratulating the soon-to-be 45th president of the United States.   Merkel's (translated) message read: ""Germany and America are bound by values -- democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of the individual, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views. On the basis of these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.""   Seemingly listing all the issues that divided them, Merkel extended a tentative hand of friendship by daring Trump to renounce many of the ideologies he flirted with during his presidential campaign.   We do not know if Trump responded. But the president-elect, who has previously tweeted disrespectful and angry comments about the German chancellor's immigration policy, cannot afford to upset her.   Merkel is an important ally. Uniquely among European leaders, Merkel has fended off populist challengers and is almost certain to win re-election in September. She will be a fixture throughout the first term of the Trump presidency.   In her 11th year in office, the pastor's daughter who grew up under a communist regime -- and who speaks flawless Russian -- is not likely to welcome the president-elect's friendly relations with Vladimir Putin. Nor is Germany, the largest exporter of goods in the Western world, enamored by Trump's protectionism. Should the future president be worried? Or could he simply ignore the German chancellor?   America needs its allies in international forums such as the G-20, the G-7 and even the U.N. In everyday diplomacy the EU has often acted as a go-between for the U.S., most recently in relation to Turkey. In a potential conflict with China, the new president would need to count on his democratic allies in Europe. Trump needs to establish positive relations with Europe in general, and in particular with Merkel.   The German chancellor comes prepared. Having outmaneuvered strong and often misogynistic men in her own party, the Christian Democratic Union, she has a record of dealing with men in power. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi suffered politically when he used lewd comments about the German leader's physique. And Putin's attempts to bully Merkel have failed time and again. He once let his dog into his office to scare Merkel -- the former KGB man knew she'd been bitten by a dog in her youth. Her response? She persuaded other European powers and businesses to introduce crippling economic sanctions Russia could ill afford, proving Merkel's careful diplomacy and networks to be stronger than Russia's military might. Trump, beware!   As much as Trump would like to establish more friendly relations with Moscow, the European Union is the U.S.'s largest trading partner: More than 6 million jobs in America depend on trade with the EU. Upsetting that relationship will make it difficult to bring back jobs to the American rust belt, the area that overwhelmingly elected Trump. The president-elect needs to develop a very different style if he is to establish positive relations with Germany and the EU -- upsetting Europe's strongest power is not an option for the New York businessman-turned-politician.   ----------  Matthew Qvortrup, an expert on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, is the author of ""Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader.""

201,2448807843.xml,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Facebook said it will ban groups that openly support QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that paints President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and ""deep state"" government officials.   The company said Tuesday that it will remove Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts for ""representing QAnon"" -- even if they don't promote violence. The social network said it will consider a variety of factors to decide if a group meets its criteria for a ban, including its name, the biography or ""about"" section of the page, and discussions within the page, group or Instagram account.Mentions of QAnon in a group focused on a different subject won't necessarily lead to a ban, Facebook said. Administrators of banned groups will have their personal accounts disabled as well.The company said it started to enforce the policy Tuesday but cautioned that it ""will take time and will continue in the coming days and weeks.""""We've seen several issues that led to today's update,"" Facebook said in a blog post. ""While we've removed QAnon content that celebrates and supports violence, we've seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the west coast wildfires were started by certain groups, which diverted attention of local officials from fighting the fires and protecting the public.""  Iran ordered to pay: A U.S. judge has ordered Iran to pay $1.45 billion to the family of a former FBI agent believed to have been kidnapped by the Islamic Republic while on an unauthorized CIA mission to an Iranian island in 2007.The judgment this month comes after Robert Levinson's family and the U.S. government now believe he died in the Iranian government's custody, something long denied by Tehran, though officials over time have offered contradictory accounts about what happened to him on Kish Island.In a ruling last week, the U.S. District Court in Washington found Iran owed Levinson's family $1.35 billion in punitive damages and $107 million in compensatory damages for his kidnapping. The court cited the case of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died in 2017 shortly after being freed from captivity in North Korea, in deciding to award the amount of punitive damages to Levinson's family.

EU plastics: The European Union is facing a growing waste problem and is at risk of missing its plastic recycling targets for 2025 and 2030 as more stringent export rules will be implemented next year, the bloc's independent auditor warned Tuesday.As part of its strategy adopted in 2018, the European Commission set itself the goal that at least 50% of all plastic packaging waste will be recycled by 2025, and to reach 55% by 2030. The EU's executive arm also wants to ensure that all plastic packaging on the EU market will be either reusable or recyclable by 2030.But while the European Commission has vowed to make the fight against climate change a priority, EU countries are still incinerating more than they recycle, releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Samo Jereb, the auditor in charge of the review, said reversing that trend is a ""daunting challenge,"" especially amid the coronavirus crisis.  Poisoning confirmed: The global chemical watchdog group has confirmed Germany and other countries' findings that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a Soviet-era nerve agent, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said Tuesday.Steffen Seibert said in a statement that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, had carried out its own analysis of samples taken from Navalny, and they ""agree with the results already from special laboratories in Germany, Sweden and France.""Navalny, a corruption investigator who is Russian President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critic, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia.

202,1652644216.xml,"       A national leader's appearance before the U.S. Congress is usually a source of pride and unity. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned trip to Washington -- opposed by the White House and many Democrats -- has Israel politics in an uproar. The Israeli leader faces growing calls to cancel the visit as rivals accuse him of risking Israel's relations with the United States in hopes of winning extra votes in next month's Israeli parliamentary election.     But Netanyahu has shown no signs of backing down, saying Sunday he would ""do everything"" to prevent U.S.-led international negotiators from reaching a dangerous agreement with Iran over its nuclear program.     At an election rally Monday, Netanyahu insisted he will travel to Washington to speak next month. Netanyahu said: ""A bad deal with Iran is forming in Munich that will endanger Israel's existence. ... Therefore I am determined to go to Washington and present Israel's position before the members of Congress and the American people.""     The U.S. is Israel's closest and most important ally. While ties remain strong between the nations, relations between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama are another matter. The two have long had strained personal relations and differ on many policy issues, with Netanyahu favoring a more confrontational approach with his foes over Obama's inclination toward diplomacy and compromise.     The differences are especially glaring when it comes to the Iranian nuclear issue. Netanyahu has called a nuclear-armed Iran the greatest threat to his country and says its nuclear program must be dismantled.     Obama has vowed to prevent Iran from developing a bomb but has signaled he's willing to tolerate certain activities, such as uranium enrichment, a technology that Israel fears could quickly be diverted for weapons use. The U.S. and five global partners hope to reach a preliminary deal with Iran by March.     Fearful that Obama is about to reach a ""bad deal"" on Iran, Netanyahu jumped at the chance to address a joint session of Congress on March 3, two weeks before Israel's general election. The invitation was issued by Republican House Speaker John Boehner.     The White House views the planned visit as a breach of protocol, because it was not coordinated well ahead of time with the U.S. administration, which learned about it just before it was made public. The White House also cited the close proximity of the election as the reason Obama wouldn't meet Netanyahu, saying the president wants to avoid the appearance of taking sides.     Still, during Obama's appearance Monday at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the president managed to use Merkel as a counterpoint to the Israeli leader with whom he has regularly clashed.     ""As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House,"" Obama said. ""And I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one.""     Vice President Joe Biden's office said he would miss the address. Despite the stated American intention to stay out of Israeli domestic politics, Biden found the time to meet Netanyahu's chief rival, Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog, during a security conference in Germany.     Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid Party, said Netanyahu is causing ""serious damage"" to American ties and urged him to stay home.     Even some of Netanyahu's sympathizers are saying he's misjudged the situation.     ""You're right, but don't go,"" read the headline on a column by Ben-Dror Yemini in the Yediot Ahronot daily. ""Obama is wrong and you're right. But if there is any chance of budging him from his position, then you are making every possible mistake and turning him into an adversary.""     Michael Oren, who served as Netanyahu's ambassador to Washington until 2013, said that if he were still in the post, he would have advised his boss not to address Congress.     ""The last thing you want is for support of the Jewish state to become the monopoly of one party,"" said Oren, who is running for parliament with a newly formed centrist party.

203,2229917989.xml,"Theresa May ended her failed three-year quest to lead Britain out of the European Union on Friday, announcing that she will step down as Conservative Party leader June 7 and triggering a contest to choose a new prime minister who will try to complete Brexit.
""I have done my best,"" May said in a speech outside 10 Downing St., as close aides and her husband Philip looked on, before acknowledging that it was not good enough.
Concluding her remarks, she struggled to contain her emotions and her voice broke as she expressed ""enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.""
Then she turned and strode through the famous black door of No. 10.
May will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until the new leader is chosen, a process the Conservatives aim to complete by late July. The new party leader will become prime minister without the need for a general election.
She became prime minister the month after the U.K. voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, and her premiership has been consumed by the attempt to deliver on that verdict.
May was brought down by Brexit, but her nemesis wasn't the EU, with which she successfully struck a divorce deal.
She was felled by her own Conservative Party, which refused to accept it. The plan was defeated three times in Parliament, rejected both by pro-EU opposition lawmakers and by Brexit-supporting Conservatives who thought it kept Britain too closely bound to the bloc.
Many Conservative lawmakers came to see May as an obstacle and blamed her for the U.K.'s failure to leave the EU on the scheduled date of March 29. The bloc has extended that deadline until Oct. 31 in hope Britain's politicians can break their political deadlock.
The pressure on May reached breaking point this week as House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom quit and several Cabinet colleagues rejected the bill she planned to put before Parliament in a fourth attempt to secure lawmakers' backing for her Brexit blueprint.
In her farewell speech, May defended her record, saying she had ""negotiated the terms of our exit and a new relationship with our closest neighbors that protects jobs, our security and our Union.""
""I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal,"" she said. ""Sadly, I have not been able to do so.""
""It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort,"" she added.
Multiple contenders are already jockeying to replace her in a contest that will see a new leader chosen by Conservative lawmakers and party members. The early front-runner is Boris Johnson, a former foreign secretary and a strong champion of Brexit. Other contenders are likely to include Leadsom, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab.
Johnson, whose relentless criticism helped push May out of the door, tweeted: ""Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.""
Whether it is Johnson or another contender, the next prime minister is likely to be a staunch Brexiteer, who will try to renegotiate the divorce deal, and if that fails, to leave the bloc without an agreement on the terms of the departure.
""The person who will replace her will embrace the possibility of a no deal with alacrity rather than fear,"" said Steven Fielding, professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. ""They will have to embrace it if they want to be elected by the Tory party membership.""
Most businesses and economists think that would cause economic turmoil and plunge Britain into recession. Parliament has voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit, though it remains the legal default option.
But many Conservatives think embracing a no-deal Brexit may be the only way to keep the support of voters who opted in 2016 to leave the EU.
The Conservatives expect to take a bruising when results come in late Sunday from this week's European Parliament election, which many British voters are expected to use to express displeasure over the political gridlock. Opinion polls suggest Conservative voters deserting in droves to the single-issue Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage.
Any attempt to take Britain out of the EU without a deal will be fiercely resisted by Parliament, and could see pro-Europeans leave the Conservative Party.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, an opponent of Brexit, tweeted that May's exit ""will not solve the Brexit mess that the Tories have created. ... The prospect of an even more hard-line Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning.""
EU leaders expressed respect for May, and stressed they would not renegotiate the Brexit deal.
""We have set out our position on the withdrawal agreement and on the political declaration,"" said EU spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.
She said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had great respect for May and would ""equally respect and establish working relations"" with any new British leader.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would continue to ""do everything it can to ensure there is a good partnership with Britain, an orderly exit, and then continuing good cooperation.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sometimes differed publicly with May, said he was ""feeling badly"" for her.
""I like her very much,"" said Trump who is due to meet May on a state visit to Britain June 3-5.
And May departed with a warning to her successor.
""To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in Parliament where I have not,"" she said. ""Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise.""
She said it had been ""the honor of my life"" to serve as Britain's leader, the second woman to hold the job, after Margaret Thatcher.
""The second female prime minister — but certainly not the last,"" May said.

204,1916117737.xml,"Poland hasn't really had a turn in the world spotlight since the  1980s, when all eyes were on the drama of the Solidarity labor  movement's perilous but ultimately successful struggle against  Communist rule.  President Donald Trump's stop in Warsaw, where he arrived Wednesday  night on his way to the Group of 20 meeting in Germany, focuses  attention on a country viewed by many as having come full circle  since those days.Poland's right-wing government views the visit as an enormous boost  to its prestige, and has worked to ensure that Trump-friendly  crowds turn out for a U.S. president known to relish shows of  public adulation.U.S. allies in Western Europe, however, worry that the president's  visit is in effect stamping a seal of approval on the Polish  leadership's aggressive moves against democratic institutions such  as the courts and the news media and that Trump could be seen as  offering an implicit endorsement of the government's populist,  stridently anti-immigrant stance, which is reminiscent in some ways  of his own.Still colored in many ways by the sorrowful legacy of the 20th  century, including the deaths of about one-fifth of its population  in World War II, Poland has strong U.S. ties, personified by a  large diaspora in the United States. Americans of Polish ancestry  number nearly 10 million and have left an indelible mark on cities  including Chicago and New York.NATO ally Poland also hosts a contingent of about 900 U.S. troops  and has for many years contributed to U.S. and NATO missions in  Iraq and Afghanistan. And it spends more of its GDP on military  expenditures than most of its North Atlantic Treaty Organization  neighbors, a subject Trump publicly lectured the alliance about in  May.Trump's public events in Poland were scheduled for Thursday.Here's some background about the first stop on Trump's second  international trip as president.Who runs Poland? Trump's Polish counterpart, President Andrzej  Duda, shares some common policy ground with the U.S. president,  including prospects for energy deal-making, a shared mistrust of  Muslim immigrants and refugees and a degree of disdain for the  European Union. But the country's most powerful political figure is  Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the nationalist-minded ruling Law and  Justice party, which won 2015 parliamentary elections.Under Kaczynski, the party has moved to rein in the judiciary,  sought to muscle media outlets into taking a more pro-government  line and advanced various conspiracy theories, including one  surrounding the 2010 plane crash in Russia that killed dozens of  Polish dignitaries.What do Poles make of Trump? Within Poland, support for Trump tends  to break down along urban-countryside lines, with less enthusiasm  for his policies and rough-edged political style in cosmopolitan  Warsaw.In a recent Pew Global Attitudes study, Trump's ratings in Poland  and neighboring Hungary were higher than in most of the rest of  Europe, but still low in terms of his leadership qualities.  According to the survey, only 23 percent of Poles trust the U.S.  president to do the right thing in global affairs.Still, Poland is seen by Trump's entourage as far friendlier  territory than Western Europe, where his relations with leaders  like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel  Macron have been strained over the decision to abandon the landmark  Paris climate accord, among other issues.What are Warsaw's worries these days? As in most countries,  domestic issues are the biggest day-to-day concerns for most  people. When it comes to foreign policy, Russia overshadows  everything. Polish officials are keenly aware that they have  Trump's ear as he heads into bilateral talks with Russian President  Vladimir Putin on Friday on the sidelines of the summit in Germany.Is Poland out of step with the rest of Europe? Its government has  feuded with the European Union over a variety of topics, including  immigration quotas and a fray over the government's attempt to  derail an EU leadership role for former Polish Prime Minister  Donald Tusk, now seen as an adversary of the ruling party. Poland's  leaders are thought to be using Trump's visit to make at least  symbolic inroads into Germany's powerhouse status on the continent.  He will join in an event convened by Warsaw ostensibly to boost  regional trade and infrastructure -- the ""Three Seas"" initiative,  but seen by some as a Polish-led bid to carve out a separate sphere  of influence in Eastern Europe.How has history shaped Polish attitudes? Poland has a long history  of being caught between powerful warring empires. Even before  Poland's oppression-haunted decades as part of the Soviet bloc, the  country's dead in World War II amounted to 6 million, about 20  percent of the prewar population. Outside recognition of past  suffering is well received; Trump's main public event is a speech  in the capital's Krasinski Square, near a monument to the 1944  Warsaw Uprising. The president's national security adviser, H.R.  McMaster, said in a pre-trip briefing that Trump would praise  ""Polish courage throughout history's darkest hour, and celebrate  Poland's emergence as a European power.""----------laura.king@latimes.com  <CAPTION: Photo: President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive Wednesday night in Warsaw, Poland, en route to Germany.

205,1468846173.xml,"       Angela Merkel, Germany's first female leader, was sworn in  Tuesday for her third term, underlining her dominance on the  political scene in Europe's biggest economy. Merkel, 59, returns to power at a time when the region has yet to  fully get back on its feet from its still-unresolved debt crisis,  and as Germany's relations with the United States continue to  suffer from the fallout over revelations that American spies tapped  her phone and collected electronic data on ordinary Germans.  Merkel's confirmation Tuesday, in a vote by lawmakers in the  Bundestag, was virtually assured after her party, the Christian  Democrats, took first place by a wide margin in September  elections. But the party fell just short of a majority of seats in  parliament, setting off weeks of negotiation with other groups to  form a government.  Merkel will preside over a ""grand coalition"" uniting her  conservative party with its archrival, the center-left Social  Democrats, who finished second in the election. The parties agreed  on an agenda that should see a continuation of Merkel's  tax-friendly policies tempered by some concessions to the Social  Democrats, including Germany's first national minimum wage and some  pension increases.  Merkel is unlikely to deviate from Berlin's approach to the  low-boil euro debt crisis: a fierce insistence on austerity in  financially troubled countries, many of whose residents blame  Germany for inflicting economic misery on them. The finance  minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, will remain in his post.  The new government will also include Germany's first female defense  secretary, Ursula von der Leyen. The promotion of the former labor  minister is widely regarded as a sign that Merkel has picked her as  a potential successor.  But it's not as though Merkel has spoken of -- or even hinted at --  retirement. If she serves out this new term, until 2017, she will  have occupied the chancellor's office for 12 years and worked with  three American presidents. That would eclipse the record of the  other female European leader to whom Merkel is sometimes compared,  the late Margaret Thatcher, who also won three elections in Britain  and served as its prime minister for 11 years.  Merkel was confirmed Tuesday on a 462-150 vote. ""I accept the  election result and thank you for your trust,"" a smiling Merkel  said.  Merkel will make the first foreign trip of her new term Wednesday  when she travels to Paris to symbolize French and German amity  after two World Wars.  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: German Chancellor Angela Merkel talks Tuesday with members  of her government at the Bundestag in Berlin, where lawmakers  confirmed her third term on a 462-150 vote.

206,2073347491.xml,"Mesut Ozil said Sunday he was quitting the German national football team, citing ""racism"" in the criticism of him in the side's World Cup debacle.
""It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events, I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect,"" he tweeted.
Ozil, who has Turkish roots, had earlier defended his decision to pose for a controversial photograph with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May which sparked questions about his loyalty to Germany's squad ahead of the World Cup in Russia.
In a three-part statement on Twitter sent over the course of the day, an angry Ozil saved his bombshell for the final salvo.
In it, the Arsenal midfielder blamed the German Football Federation (DFB) for failing to defend him against his most strident critics.
""Arguably the issue that has frustrated me the most over the past couple of months has been the mistreatment from the DFB, and in particular the DFB President Richard Grindel,"" he said.
He said that Grindel and Germany coach Joachim Loew had asked him to give a ""joint statement to end all the talk and set the record straight"" over the picture with Erdogan.
""Whilst I attempted to explain to Grindel my heritage, ancestry and therefore reasoning behind the photo, he was far more interested in speaking about his own political views and belittling my opinion.""
Ozil said he had been unfairly blamed in Germany for the side's shock first-round defeat at the World Cup.
""I will no longer stand for being a scapegoat for his (Grindel's) incompetence and inability to do his job properly,"" he said.
Ozil said earlier that he was true to both his Turkish and German origins and insisted he did not intend to make a political statement by appearing with Erdogan.
'I have two hearts'
""Like many people, my ancestry traces back to more than one country. Whilst I grew up in Germany, my family background has its roots firmly based in Turkey,"" he said.
""I have two hearts, one German and one Turkish.""
Ozil, 29, said he had first met Erdogan in 2010 after the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel watched a Germany-Turkey match together in Berlin.
Ozil said that despite the timing of the picture with teammate Ilkay Gundogan and Erdogan -- shortly before the president won re-election in a poll endowing him with sweeping new powers -- ""it wasn't about politics or elections, it was about me respecting the highest office of my family's country"".
""My job is a football player and not a politician, and our meeting was not an endorsement of any policies,"" Ozil added.
Germany is home to more than three million people of Turkish origin.
Ozil and Gundogan were booed by German fans in pre-World Cup friendlies after posing with Erdogan in London.
Manchester City midfielder Gundogan presented him with a signed club shirt on which he had written ""to my president"".
After the tournament, Ozil came in for stinging criticism by DFB officials and German politicians across the spectrum.
Team boss Oliver Bierhoff suggested after the debacle that Germany should have considered dropping Ozil after his failure to explain himself over the Erdogan picture.
Bierhoff later backtracked, saying that he ""was wrong"" to put Ozil under undue pressure, but the picture continued to draw scorn from fans on social media.
Meanwhile, former captain Lothar Matthaeus accused Ozil of no longer looking comfortable in the Germany shirt.

207,2440631419.xml,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is no longer in a medically induced coma and is responsive, doctors treating him at Charite hospital in Berlin said Monday. But they did not rule out lasting damage from what they called his ""severe poisoning"" with what the German government has said was a military-grade nerve agent.  Navalny was flown to Germany on Aug. 22 for treatment of a suspected poisoning. Specialists from the German army later determined the poison came from the Novichok family of substances developed by the Soviet Union and used at least once before on an opponent of the Kremlin.Ties between Berlin and Moscow, already strained over Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea and suspected involvement in the slaying of a Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park last year, have been further eroded by the poisoning of Navalny.The German government has demanded an explanation from Russia, but the Kremlin does not seem inclined to offer one, saying it has not yet been shown proof that Navalny was poisoned.Navalny has been brought out of the medically induced coma and is being weaned from a respirator, the hospital said in a statement.""He is responsive to verbal stimuli,"" the statement said. ""It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning.""Russia has a long history of using poison in assassination attempts, including Novichok agents. Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer living in England, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, were poisoned by a Novichok agent in March 2018, and British authorities accused operatives from Russia's military intelligence service of carrying out the attack. Both Skripals survived.Navalny fell ill Aug. 20, as he made his way back to Moscow after meetings with opposition politicians in Siberia, before nationwide local elections. Two days later, he was evacuated to Berlin. Experts from the German army were asked to run tests that detected a substance from the Novichok group in Navalny's system.News of Navalny's improved health came amid a debate in Berlin over how to respond to the poisoning. There have been calls for the German government to cancel the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has not ruled out any measures at this point, her spokesman said Monday, as calls increased for construction of the final 90 miles of the $11 billion pipeline project to be halted in response to the poisoning.CAPTION: Photo: (Alexei) NavalnyCREDIT: By Melissa Eddy, The New York Times",2020-09-08
208,1652644120.xml,"       Greece put a brave face on its fraught negotiations with European bailout creditors, with the new prime minister voicing confidence Monday that a compromise can be reached at high-stakes meetings in coming days. Alexis Tsipras' comments came as Greek stocks and bonds took a drubbing after the far left-led government renewed a pledge to seek bailout debt forgiveness and dubbed the country's rescue package -- with its conditions of strict austerity -- a ""toxic fantasy.""   ""I don't believe there is a serious reason for there not to be an agreement ... with our partners -- just political reasons,"" Tsipras said after a meeting in Vienna with Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann.   ""If we are brought to an impasse due to such political reasons, then I think that would be a decision to torpedo our common European future,"" Tsipras added. ""And I think nobody harbors such intentions.""   Tsipras' government won Jan. 25 elections promising relief for Greeks who have suffered through six years of recession and a dramatic drop in living standards. It's under intense pressure to work out a deal with bailout creditors in coming weeks or days, which would unlock funds and secure cheap financing for Greek banks -- five of which suffered a one-notch downgrade Monday by Moody's ratings agency.   In the Syriza party's first week in power, Greece has suffered a ratings downgrade and a decision by the European Central Bank not to accept its bonds as collateral for credit to Greek lenders. A flurry of visits to key European partners earned Tsipras' government little more than expressions of sympathy.   Greece faces a grilling at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, with fears of a chaotic currency exit returning.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that Berlin wants Greece to stay in the eurozone, but any agreement must be based on existing bailout commitments.   ""I think what counts is what Greece will put on the table at (Wednesday's) meeting or perhaps a few days later,"" she said after talks in Washington with President Barack Obama. ""I've always said I would wait for Greece to come with a sustainable proposal and then we'll talk about this.""   Tsipras' government, which ousted the less-confrontational conservatives, argues that Greece's $360 billion debt will be increasingly unsustainable unless it receives generous repayment relief that would allow its battered economy to recover.   Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis dismissed the $270 billion bailout packages crafted by Greece's lenders after the country nearly went bust in 2010 as a ""toxic fantasy"" that had always been doomed to fail.   ""The time has come to say what officials admit when the microphones are turned off and say out in the open. ... At some point someone has to say 'No' and that role has fallen to us, little Greece,"" he told parliament.   Varoufakis said Athens wants a ""bridge agreement"" that would involve rewriting a third of the country's reform and austerity commitments, and modest primary surplus targets of 1.5 percent.   A Finance Ministry official said Athens would seek permission to raise more funds through treasury bill issues and push the European Central Bank to hand over 1.9 billion euros in profits from Greek bond holdings. The official added that Greece would stick by its electoral pledges on reducing the debt and taking relief action for citizens worst-hit by the crisis.   Amid wider European losses, Greek shares closed down 4.75 percent after dropping as much as 6 percent, continuing a negative run.   U.S. stocks closed lower on weak Chinese trade data and the worries about Greece's finances.   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 95 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,729 Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost eight points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,046. The Nasdaq composite fell 18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,726.

209,2132207450.xml,"It seems that soldiers who were captured aren't the only ones that President Donald Trump doesn't like. He apparently doesn't care much for the ones who died for their country either.  On Saturday afternoon, the president was scheduled to attend a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where 2,289 U.S. soldiers are buried -- a small part of the 116,000 Americans who gave the last full measure of devotion during World War I. It was the sort of solemn occasion that U.S. presidents have considered an integral part of their duty at least since the Gettysburg Address. But Trump couldn't be bothered.The White House explained that bad weather grounded the helicopters that Trump and his entourage were planning to take. Yet somehow bad weather did not prevent French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel or Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from attending outdoor ceremonies commemorating the end of World War I that afternoon. Somehow bad weather did not stop Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and retired Gen. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, from attending the very ceremony that Trump could not make.Rather than make the hourlong drive (Aisne-Marne is only 55 miles from Paris), the low-energy president remained behind at the U.S. ambassador's residence. It's not as if he didn't sacrifice anything, however. Odds are that his room didn't have Fox News. So he was probably reduced to watching CNN all afternoon. If the New York dating scene was Trump's personal Vietnam, this was his personal Verdun.The irony is that Trump prides himself on being pro-military. When asked this week to comment on Michelle Obama's new memoir, in which she wrote that she could never forgive him for spreading the ""crazy and mean-spirited"" birtherism conspiracy theory, he replied that he could never forgive President Barack Obama for ""what he did to our United States military."" And what did Barack Obama do that was so awful? He spent a little less for defense than Trump is.Trump is right that he and the Republican Congress have increased defense spending -- it has gone from roughly $600 billion to $700 billion a year -- but he's wrong to blame Obama alone for the lower levels during his presidency. The budget-squeezing sequestration process was a bipartisan initiative designed to cut the deficit without tax increases. What Trump doesn't understand is that showering money on the armed forces doesn't mean that he respects or supports what they do.Trump shows what he really thinks of the troops by using them as political props. He deployed 5,600 troops just before the midterm elections to guard against the supposed threat posed by a few thousand unarmed refugees hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. He even suggested that the troops should commit the war crime of opening fire on migrants who threw rocks.The Pentagon grandly dubbed this Operation Faithful Patriot and circulated pictures of troops in full ""battle rattle"" stringing barbed wire, only to quietly drop the ludicrous moniker amid Election Day. Conveniently enough, Trump and his friends at Fox essentially stopped speaking about the caravan once the votes were cast. But, as The New York Times reports, the troops are still in the field, without electricity or hot meals -- or a mission. They will likely spend Thanksgiving away from their families.Naturally, Trump will not bother to visit them, even though there is no risk in traveling to Texas. He still has not visited U.S. troops deployed to a war zone -- although he has spent 72 days at Mar-a-Lago and 58 days at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club.To add insult to injury, consider Trump's reaction after Ian David Long, a Marine veteran of Afghanistan, killed 12 people in a Thousand Oaks, Calif., bar this past week. Trump called him a ""very sick puppy"" and blamed his rampage on post-traumatic stress disorder without any actual evidence. (A high school track teacher reported that Long physically menaced her long before he joined the Marine Corps.) ""People come back -- that's why it's a horrific thing -- they come back, they're never the same,"" the president said.This is precisely the kind of pernicious stereotype -- that veterans are ticking time bombs -- that veterans groups have worked so hard to refute. It simply isn't true, and it demeans the service of countless soldiers who serve honorably and return to live peaceful, productive lives. ""Comments like this one from the commander in chief are extremely unhelpful,"" Paul Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America told The Post.So much for Trump's conceit that he is pro-military. It has about as much factual foundation as his claim not to know his newly appointed acting attorney general. He has no understanding of what soldiers do or the honor code by which they live. His idea of military service is marching in a parade -- and he is peeved he couldn't have one in Washington this Veterans Day. Through his words and deeds, the commander in chief shows his contempt for the men and women in uniform.----------The Washington PostMax Boot, a Washington Post columnist, is a senior fellow in national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.CAPTION: Photo: White House chief of staff John Kelly, left, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Marine Gen.

210,420287633.xml,"         Germany's election ended in a dramatic and confusing stalemate Sunday night with both Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and challenger Angela Merkel claiming victory.    Merkel's party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, finished first, but it saw a lead in opinion polls of more than 20 points just two months ago shrivel to less than 1 percentage point when the votes were tallied.    The CDU won 35.2 percent of the vote and Schroeder's Social Democrats, known as the SPD, had 34.3 percent, according to official results. More important, the CDU won 225 seats in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, compared to 222 for the SPD.    The pro-business Free Democrats, the FDP, got 61 seats; the Green Party, the SPD's current coalition partner, finished with 51; and the new Left Party got 54 seats. Merkel's preferred coalition partner was the FDP, but their combined total falls short of the 48.5 percent needed to form a government.    The likely outcome, according to many experts, is a ""grand coalition"" between the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats with Merkel as chancellor and Schroeder in retirement.    Shortly after the first exit polls were announced Sunday evening, a subdued Merkel appeared at a somber CDU headquarters and declared that she received the voters' mandate to lead the next government.    ""What is important now is to form a stable government for the people in Germany, and we ... quite clearly have the mandate to do that,"" she said.    Under the country's election law, Merkel will be given first crack at forming a government. If she succeeds, she would be Germany's first female chancellor and the first to come from the former East Germany.    Schroeder shows fire    Less than an hour after Merkel spoke, a fired-up Schroeder appeared at his party's headquarters, pumping his fists and delivering a stinging rebuke to his rival.    ""I do not understand ... how the CDU could be so self-confident and so arrogant to ... claim political leadership from a disastrous result in these elections,"" he told his wildly cheering supporters.    ""I feel reconfirmed to make sure that over the next few years there will be a stable government under my leadership,"" he said.    Later in the evening, as the candidates from all the parties gathered in a television studio for their ritual joint appearance, Merkel acknowledged she was disappointed with the result.    ""Of course I would have preferred a coalition with FDP, but that is not possible,"" she said.    Schroeder continued to insist that his better-than-expected result should be counted as a win.    ""There was only one clear loser, and that is Mrs. Merkel,"" he said. ""Apart from myself, there is nobody able to build a stable government.""    Schroeder seems to be hoping that he can lure the Free Democrats into his coalition with the Green Party, but FDP leader Guido Westerwelle was quick to throw cold water on that idea, saying he would prefer to remain in opposition rather than join a coalition with Schroeder's party.    Both leaders said they would open talks with all parties except the Left Party, headed by Oskar Lafontaine and made up of former communists and renegade Social Democrats.    Although several possibilities are on the table, it seems the most likely scenario is a grand coalition with the two largest parties sharing power. That would be Germany's second experiment with such an arrangement. The first was in 1966-69 when Kurt Kiesinger's Christian Democrats and Willy Brandt's Social Democrats shared power.    ""It was a reform coalition and it worked,"" said Manfred Wilke, a political scientist at the Berlin Free University. ""In today's situation I'm not sure that it would work again. The SPD is in inner crisis because they are blocked by the trade unions and their own left wing. This faction sees itself as the opposition to block all reforms.""    Most politicians and analysts agreed. ""It's a recipe for paralysis,"" said William Drozdiak, president of the American Council on Germany.    ""It's very disappointing,"" said Silvana Koch-Mehrin, the FDP's leader in the European Parliament. ""The reforms which will be so necessary won't happen for the next few years.""    But Manfred Guellner, director of Forsa, one of Germany's leading polling organizations, said ordinary Germans don't see it that way.    'Germans like consensus'    ""The media and the politicians will complain, but the people will not be unhappy with a grand coalition,"" he said. ""Germans like consensus ... and this is what they expect from politicians.""    The hard bargaining and horse trading already have begun and likely will last for several days, and the final outcome may have to wait until Oct. 2. The death of a parliamentary candidate in Dresden last week has forced a postponement of the vote there.    If, as expected, Merkel emerges as Germany's first female chancellor, she undoubtedly will be second-guessed for losing what appeared to be an insurmountable lead.    Stumbles during campaign    Merkel was tentative and defensive on the campaign trial. She clearly was bested by Schroeder in the only one-on-one televised debate. And she gave her rival plenty of ammunition when she made Paul Kirchhof, a controversial flat-tax advocate, a key figure in her campaign.    But Margarita Mathiopoulos, a senior FDP adviser, said she thought the real reason for Merkel's disappointing showing was that she was poorly supported by the overwhelmingly male leadership of the CDU.    ""This is a lesson for Hillary Clinton if she wants to run for president,"" said Mathiopoulos.    Merkel's rise through the ranks of the male-dominated, boardroom politics of the CDU is remarkable in itself, but the fact that she is a woman did not seem to factor in the campaign.    ""I think it's great that she's a woman,"" said Wilhelm Arens, 75, a manager with a state insurance agency who voted for Schroeder. ""I've had female bosses in the past and they were absolutely first- rate.""    Schroeder took a huge political risk by calling for elections a year early. He gambled that his personal persuasiveness and superior skills as a campaigner would overcome Merkel's lead. It may yet pay off.    Even though his party finished second, Schroeder remains a more popular figure than Merkel, with opinion polls a week before the election showing a clear preference for Schroeder over Merkel.    But in Germany's parliamentary system, it is the party that counts, and voters turned away from Schroeder's SDP in droves. The center-left party is riven by factions, and Schroeder was doomed by his inability to make headway against a stagnant economy that has posted five consecutive years of zero growth and an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent.    After seven years as chancellor, Schroeder would leave behind a mixed legacy. In the eyes of most Germans, his greatest achievement may have been his determination to withstand American pressure and keep Germany out of the Iraq war.    ""I give him credit for that. I think he did pretty good in foreign policy,"" said Berliner Marc Knierim, 33, who nonetheless voted for the Green Party.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTOS 4; Caption: PHOTO (color): Angela Merkel is in line to become Germany's next chancellor after her Christian Democratic Union gained the most parliament seats in Sunday's balloting.

211,1904751651.xml,"The U.S. will pull out of the Paris accord on global warming, President Donald Trump announced Thursday, offering a statement of unabashed nationalism as he turned away from a global leadership role in the fight against climate change. ""It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ... before Paris, France,"" Trump declared to administration officials and supporters in the White House Rose Garden.The climate agreement would ""undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty ... and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world,"" he said. ""It is time to exit the Paris accord.""The move will not take effect for almost four years, under the terms of the agreement, increasing the likelihood that the fate of the climate deal will be an issue in the next presidential election.In the interim, Trump said, he hopes to negotiate a new agreement ""on terms that are fair to the United States.""That's not likely to be easy. In advance of the announcement, world leaders lobbied Trump to stay in the agreement and repeatedly announced their intentions to stick with the terms that were agreed to in Paris in 2015 after years of negotiations.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, responding to Trump, said she regretted the U.S. decision and would continue to work to ""save our Earth.""She said in a separate joint statement with the leaders of France and Italy that the agreement ""cannot be renegotiated.""French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had made ""an error for the future of his country and his people and a mistake for the future of the planet.""In his statement, Trump lashed out at foreign leaders, saying they supported the agreement because it was a ""massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.""The climate deal was ""less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,"" he said, adding that ""we don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.""Trump said the accord would allow China, India and others to continue emitting greenhouse gases while imposing unfair burdens on the U.S. It would also cost the U.S. millions of jobs, he said.The raw deal that Trump described contrasts sharply with the view of many Republican business leaders, who had lobbied the White House against making the move.They and others say that policies designed to limit global warming are helping the U.S. economy by building up new industries, especially solar and wind power.The agreement, which almost every country in the world has joined, is designed to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in order to keep temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels.That's the point at which climate scientists warn the impact of climate change worldwide would be severe.""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,"" former President Barack Obama said in a statement responding to Trump's announcement.""But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got,"" he said.Even though states cannot individually join the accord, they are stepping up goals for emissions reductions and forging climate agreements with like-minded counterparts in other countries.""California will resist this misguided and insane course of action,"" California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement. He and the governors of New York and Washington announced they had formed a new United States Climate Alliance to guide states committed to reaching the climate goals agreed to in Paris.Mayors of 50 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, also pledged that they will adhere to the commitments made by the Obama administration.Among them was the mayor of Pittsburgh, which Trump had singled out.""It's now up to cities to lead,"" Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said.When the agreement was signed, Obama had hailed it as one of his major accomplishments.Despite the trends in technology, the departure of the world's biggest economy is certain to disrupt international plans to combat global warming. The U.S. will now join the only other nations that refused to sign on -- Nicaragua and Syria.The move may also harm the growing U.S. clean-energy industry, which may now see China and Europe take the lead in developing advanced technologies.That prospect drew dismayed reactions from the heads of some of country's largest companies.""Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government,"" Jeff Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric, said in a Twitter message.Elon Musk, head of Tesla, announced that he was withdrawing from a White House advisory council on manufacturing.The most immediate impact of Trump's decision will hit some of the world's poorest countries. Billions of dollars that the U.S. had committed to a fund to help developing countries cope with the effects of global warming won't be delivered.""These countries are interested in participating in this agreement, but it is not clear how much they can do without that assistance,"" said Jonathan Pershing, who was a Special Envoy for Climate Change during the Obama administration.The affected countries include island nations confronting rising sea levels and African countries combating drought-induced famine.Trump depicted the climate fund as an unacceptable and unfair drain on the U.S. treasury.""Billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us,"" Trump said.Outside economists have said the cost to the U.S. of staying in the accord would have been minimal, as it allowed flexibility to adjust targets. Keeping the treaty intact would not have prevented the administration from rolling back some of Obama's ambitious domestic climate programs, they said.But some conservatives and administration officials eager to quit the agreement warned Trump that environmental activists could use it to block the administration from its efforts to dismantle Obama's policies.Trump's decision to isolate the United States from the global climate fight could have many ripple effects. Reluctant participants in the pact, notably Russia, could opt out as well.The lengthy withdrawal process gave a measure of hope to environmental activists and their allies that the damage can ultimately be contained -- either by a change of heart by Trump if public pressure mounts, or by a change of leadership in the White House.""The Americans can't just get out of the agreement,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Wednesday at an event in Berlin, in anticipation of Trump's action. At last week's Group of Seven summit of the world's largest economic powers, ""we tried to explain this in clear, simple, sentences to Mr. Trump,"" Juncker said, but ""it looks like that attempt failed.""""Not everything that is written in international agreements is fake news,"" he added.The bitter tone reflects how Trump's action is likely to chill diplomatic relations on matters that extend beyond climate action.""The U.S. traditionally has taken seriously its international pledges, even the non-binding ones, and has tried to induce other countries to do that,"" said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.Dropping out of such a commitment ""makes it very hard for the U.S. to press other countries to fulfill international commitments in all areas, not just climate,"" he said.While most other big countries are expressing resolve to stick with the agreement, supporters worry that if the U.S. stays out for more than a few years, that resolve will erode.""It is hard to sustain an effort like this over a long period of time without the United States,"" said Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the accord for the Obama administration. ""Countries are going to stay in for the short run, and hope for different politics in the White House before long.""On Capitol Hill, most reaction fell along partisan lines, but some showed how the climate issue could reshape politics in certain parts of the country.Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., whose constituents have been dealing with repeated flooding associated with rising sea levels, called Trump's decision ""a strategic mistake and something that really sets us back.""On the other side of the ledger, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a Democrat representing a state long associated with coal mining, said that ""while I believe that the United States and the world should continue to pursue a cleaner energy future, I do not believe that the Paris Agreement ensures a balance between our environment and the economy.""----------evan.halper@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: President Trump explains Thursday at the White House why the  U.S. is quitting the Paris deal.

212,1030075018.xml,"      Wisconsin spill follows Enbridge safety reforms ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Enbridge, a beleaguered Canadian oil pipeline company, has spilled more than 50,000 gallons of light crude oil in rural Wisconsin, shortly after the company said it had implemented safety reforms after a massive 2010 spill in Michigan.  Officials for Alberta-based Enbridge Inc., one of the United States' most vital suppliers of Canadian oil, said Friday's spill has been contained by cleanup workers, who are now trying to repair and restart the 24-inch pipeline known as Line 14, which carries more than 300,000 barrels a day.  The incident is another black mark for an ambitious energy company ridiculed this month by U.S. safety officials, who likened Enbridge workers to the Keystone Kops. The comparison came after an investigation of a broken pipeline that released more than 800,000 gallons of heavy crude near Marshall, Mich., one of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history and certainly the most expensive.  The new spill, in sparsely populated Adams County, Wis., forced the evacuation of two homes. It is the company's worst spill since the 2010 disaster.  According to Enbridge company data collected by the Polaris Institute, a Canadian think tank, Enbridge pipelines have spilled 804 times since 1999 and leaked 6.8 million gallons of oil.  Enbridge spokeswoman Lorraine Little said federal and company investigators are looking into the accident, but no explanation is available yet. ""It's too soon to tell at this point,"" she said.  She said Enbridge performed two inspections on Line 14 in the past year. Tower in Pisa not the only monument that's leaning  The ancient Colosseum of Rome, where gladiators fought for their lives, is slanting about 16 inches lower on the south side than on the north, and authorities are investigating whether it needs urgent repairs.  Experts noticed the incline about a year ago and have been monitoring it for the past few months, Rossella Rea, director at the 2,000-year-old monument, wrote in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Sunday.  The Leaning Tower of Pisa was worked on for a decade to make it safe for visitors.  Final approach for rover in search of Martian life  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA's Mars rover was on its final approach to the Red Planet on Sunday, heading toward a mountain that may hold clues about whether life has ever existed on Mars, officials said.  The rover, known as Curiosity, has been careening toward Mars since its launch in November. The nuclear-powered rover is the size of a compact car and is expected to end its 352 million-mile journey at 1:31 a.m. EDT. Aug. 6.  Survey: Support eroding for Merkel's decisions  BERLIN -- Only one-third of Germans believe Angela Merkel is making the right decisions over the eurozone debt crisis, according to a new survey, pointing to a slip in support for the chancellor.  The survey by YouGov, in Monday's edition of Bild newspaper, found 33 percent in favor of her stance and 48 percent against, a setback for the chancellor who is set to seek a third term in the 2013 election, which she has vowed to make a vote on Europe.  Italian Embassy stormed in Yemen; 1 kidnapped  Gunmen kidnapped an Italian Embassy security officer in Yemen on Sunday and about 100 armed tribesmen loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh stormed the Interior Ministry, demanding to be enlisted in the police force, officials said.  A spokesman for the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome said a member of the country's Carabinieri military police had been seized in Yemen and that a crisis committee had been activated.  THE NEWSMAKER  Congress to talk taxes  Congress is unlikely to resolve tax and spending issues before the Nov. 6 elections, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Sunday, but lawmakers are working on a proposal to tackle the issue after the elections. Durbin said a bipartisan group is in talks to develop a solution to steep tax increases and spending cuts.  China textbook prompts protest in Hong Kong  HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of Hong Kong parents, students and teachers marched in the streets Sunday to protest a school curriculum plan they say is an attempt to brainwash students by extolling the achievements of the Chinese Communist party.  The furor focuses on a Hong Kong government-funded 34-page book titled ""The China Model"" celebrating China's single-party Communist state as a unique political system.  Low voter turnout saves Romanian president  BUCHAREST, Romania -- President Traian Basescu will remain in office after a referendum on his impeachment Sunday failed because of low voter turnout.  Though nearly 85 percent of those who voted backed the proposal to oust Basescu, he will return to the office from which he was suspended. The CCSB polling agency estimated the turnout at 44 percent of registered voters. More than half of the electorate had to vote for the referendum to be valid.  Pyramid scheme suspect from Germany arrested  A German man accused of using an Internet pyramid scheme to bilk investors of more than $100 million dollars and then going on the run for five years has been arrested in Las Vegas, a U.S. official said Sunday.

213,419754699.xml,"         Everyone is talking about the new Europe these days, so I thought I might seek her out. Who is this creature who dares to diss Schroeder, Fischer and French President Jacques Chirac?    In the end, I located her--or one of her kind--in an improbably old European setting: a private breakfast room in downtown Berlin's Hotel Palace, the sort of sterile five-star place where the ghosts of the Elysee Treaty might commune. She appeared in the person of Angela Merkel, potential chancellor of Germany.    Merkel may be chairwoman of one of the stuffiest of Europe's political parties, the go-along, get-along Christian Democratic Union. But this season she has challenged the German establishment by throwing the support of her party behind the smaller nations that penned the ""new Europe"" letter to President Bush. On a Washington visit this week, Merkel plans to take a position decisively to the right of Germany's other big conservative leader, the preachy Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union.    The Merkel rallying cry -- ""dictators understand only the language of threat"" -- is so sharp, so inappropriate to the salon as to seem positively un-German.    When we met at the palace, I reflected that Merkel, 48, differed from most German alpha politicians in at least three ways. The first is that she is not a professional politician. She trained as a particle physicist. The second is that she is an Easterner and lived plenty of adult years under the communists. In other words, her formative experience was the Cold War.    The third is that she is a woman, still not the norm for the top echelon of German politics.    All these factors mean that the German political world tends to underestimate her as a competitor, or dismiss her as ""not cutting edge."" A non-blonde, non-young woman without a big power base can't win for the CDU and is just a quota choice, goes the received wisdom. Therefore, Stoiber had to be the 2002 chancellor candidate. Besides, Merkel's critics argue: the Cold War and its rhetoric are so yesterday. But it also means that she is accustomed to criticism, and is therefore unflappable.    The differences between Merkel's position on the U.S. and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's turn out to be wider than--to stick to the Cold War imagery--the old Fulda Gap.    ""If I had been the head of the government, I would have signed that initiative,"" she says, referring to the letter published by leaders of eight countries airing their differences with German policy on Iraq.    ""There are two lessons we have from history. The first is `no war.' The second is `no special path for Germany.' "" And that means, she sums up: ""We always have to find solutions with our allies."" This is the opposite approach of Schroeder and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's UN blocking action.    ""What's more,"" she says, ""Germany must ask: `What is in German interest?' It is not merely giving thanks to the U.S. for history."" It is also aiding the U.S. Germans, she says, are completely convinced that if anything happens to them, the U.S. will save them. ""They don't realize if we don't help America, America won't help us.""    There remains, however, the question of whether the ""Angela as Rebel"" model will break down when it comes to economics. Chancellor Schroeder has left the CDU and its Christian Social Union partner an enviable opportunity when it comes to taxes. Schroeder's insistence that it is time to raise rates provoked national outrage.    Merkel, alas, does not seem eager to exploit her tax advantage. Rather, she posits that Germany cannot afford rate cuts because they will widen the deficit too much.    Merkel's stolid thesis reflects the extraordinary pro-tax consensus of the German political leadership: there is little difference here between Merkel, Schroeder or Fischer. Still, on foreign policy, Merkel, with her unabashed embrace of the U.S., has established herself as a true radical.    The Merkel position is not even uniformly popular within her own party. This is something her rivals will try to exploit. Their goal would be to bump her up to candidate for the ceremonial presidency post, while reserving the powerful chancellor job for themselves.    The atmosphere within Germany may be changing. Earlier this month, voters abandoned Schroeder's Social Democrats in droves in two big state elections. Polls suggested the economy was the main factor behind their shift, but Schroeder's explicit peace-at-any- price line did not carry his party either.    Public opinion will probably move toward the U.S. the moment an Iraq war is launched. Much, of course, depends on what happens in Iraq. In other words, Germany remains both isolated and in play. Its foreign policy confronts challenges not only from outside, but, as Merkel proves, from within. PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: (Angela) Merkel.  ",2003-02-26
214,915989505.xml,"      ElBaradei drops bid for Egyptian presidency CAIRO -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed ElBaradei quit the race  for the Egyptian presidency Saturday in protest over the military's  persistent grip on power despite a year of revolution and political  upheaval.   ElBaradei's announcement was a strategic and emotional setback for  liberal and secular activists who had hoped the former head of the  United Nations nuclear watchdog agency would propel the country  toward democratic reforms to replace the corrupt legacy of deposed  President Hosni Mubarak.   ""I have decided not to run for the post of the president of the  republic,"" ElBaradei said in a statement. ""My conscience does not  permit me to run for the presidency or any other official position  unless it is within a democratic framework.""   ElBaradei's chances of winning the presidential election --  scheduled for June -- had dimmed in recent weeks. He could not  muster the organizational prowess and appeal of Islamist parties.   His announcement follows the turbulent arc of a protest movement  that was unified early but splintered as political and religious  parties struggled against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.  ElBaradei has been an articulate voice against the power elite, but  he has been outflanked by generals and the well-organized Muslim  Brotherhood.   The former head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency  said the military's hold had become so pervasive and reflective of  Mubarak's police state, that it appeared as if ""no revolution took  place and no regime has fallen.""   Libya aims to quell battle between rival militias   Fighters from neighboring Libyan towns blasted each other with  artillery and rockets Saturday, killing at least two people and  wounding 36 in the latest violence between militias who refuse to  disarm after toppling Moammar Gadhafi.   Interim Defense Minister Osama al-Juwali rushed to Gharyan, 50  miles south of Tripoli, to try to halt battles between the militias  of that town and neighboring Assabia, officials with Libya's  interim government said.   Police accuse suspect in killings of homeless men   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A 23-year-old former marine who some say was  distraught after combat service in Iraq has been named a suspect in  the serial killings of four homeless men in Orange County.

Police identified the man as Itzcoatl  Ocampo,  of Yorba Linda, who was being held at the Anaheim jail  without bail.  Myanmar: 302 political prisoners among freed   YANGON, Myanmar -- Myanmar's government said Saturday that 302 of  the 651 detainees it freed last week were political prisoners whose  release had been sought by the National League for Democracy party  of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.   They were freed so they can play a part in the political process,  Home Minister Lt. Gen. Ko Ko told reporters, suggesting they might  be allowed to run for parliament despite their prison records.  Iran OKs IAEA visit, not nuclear concessions   TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran confirmed Saturday inspectors of the U.N.'s  International Atomic Energy Agency will visit, the official news  agency ISNA reported. But Tehran reiterated that it will not make  concessions over its nuclear rights.   The IAEA delegation will visit Jan. 28, Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast said. ""But Iran is absolutely serious in  maintaining its nuclear rights and will not make any concessions in  this regard,"" he said.   The Newsmaker  Merkel: Act now on euro   German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday that European leaders  need to act fast on plans to strengthen spending rules and launch a  permanent bailout fund for eurozone countries, and ""not to try to  soften it."" Her remarks came a day after a cut in credit ratings of  several euro countries.

Kaeppeler, who showed her talent, singing opera, strutted in a  bikini and dazzled the crowd in a black gown she compared to the  wedding dress worn by Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.  U.S. judge OKs tighter border-state gun rules   WASHINGTON -- In a victory for the Obama administration, a federal  judge has upheld new federal rules requiring gun dealers in four  states bordering Mexico -- Arizona, California, New Mexico and  Texas -- to report the sales of multiple semiautomatic rifles,  despite a challenge by the gun industry.   Judge Rosemary Collyer, appointed by President George W. Bush,  found that the requirement was sufficiently narrowly tailored as  part of efforts to clamp down on weapons flowing across the border.

215,419694328.xml,"         The German government suffered a setback Friday in its drive to boost the nation's stagnant economy by cutting taxes and restraining welfare outlays, a plan on which Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has staked his political future.    With Europe's biggest economy in its third year of near-zero growth, Schroeder has promised to push economic bills through parliament by year's end to tackle a 10 percent jobless rate undermining his popularity.    But his plans were upset Friday when conservatives in control of the upper house declined to advance planned cuts in income taxes and jobless benefits.    Schroeder accused them of putting politics ahead of the national interest. He also renewed an offer of urgent, face-to-face negotiations with the conservatives' top two leaders to seek a compromise on the legislation.    ""I hope we can overcome this blockade in a coalition of common sense,"" Schroeder told reporters at the chancellery. ""In this situation, what Germany needs is cooperation between the big political powers.""    Pointing to the acceleration of the U.S. economy after tax cuts there, the center-left government hopes to give Europe's largest economy a boost in 2004 by moving up an $18 billion tax cut by a year to January.    Conservatives argue the tax cut will force the government, whose budget deficit breaks strict European Union rules designed to protect the euro, to run up too much new debt.    The upper house also rejected Schroeder's labor-market bill, with critics saying they want it not only to reduce unemployment benefits but also to put more pressure on people to take low-wage jobs. Both bills are headed for a mediation committee for what are expected to be weeks of wrangling.    Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, a leading conservative who lost narrowly to Schroeder in national elections last year, insisted the opposition was not against tax cuts.    ""We want to make the tax cut possible, but with different financing, not on credit,"" Stoiber said.    But he has so far turned down Schroeder's appeals for a top- level summit with Christian Democratic leader Angela Merkel.    Stoiber said not more than a quarter of the tax cut should be financed by new borrowing. But he also opposed raising other taxes, leaving unclear where the conservatives would seek the necessary funds.    Under pressure from industry yearning for an upturn in the economy, conservatives appear reluctant to wreck the government's plans outright.    Government and opposition are divided over where to cut government subsidies, which include aid to industry and home builders, to offset the effects of the income tax reductions.    But conservatives are also pressing Schroeder to reverse concessions made to left-wing critics within his coalition, an issue that could reopen splits inside the government.  ",2003-11-08
216,1655085131.xml,"       U.S. officials led the negotiations that ended European wars in  Bosnia, Kosovo and Georgia in recent decades, just as they guided  the talks in 1945 that ended World War II. But when the leaders of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine held a  marathon negotiation last week in the Belarus capital of Minsk to  try to halt the war in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials were not in  the room.  Their absence has become another ingredient in a debate over  President Barack Obama's foreign policy.  The decision not to attend the talks ""is striking -- it's  stunning,"" said Eugene Rumer, a former U.S. intelligence official  and Russia specialist now at the Carnegie Endowment for  International Peace in Washington.  Administration officials cite two reasons for their absence in  Minsk. They don't want the conflict to appear a Cold War-style,  U.S.-Russian confrontation, which would support Russian President  Vladimir Putin's claim that Washington has fomented the Ukraine  struggle to draw Kiev into the Western security orbit.  The White House also wants Europe, which continues to cut spending  for defense, to take the lead in resolving what the White House  considers a second-tier security problem.  The approach has drawn criticism not only from Republican  adversaries, but also from ranking figures in the Democratic  foreign policy establishment, who are pushing for the White House  to do more to stop what they consider the biggest threat to  European security since the Cold War.  This split was clear earlier this month, when a group of former  senior members of the Obama and Clinton administrations, called on  Obama to begin sending weapons and ammunition to Kiev.  The urgency of the crisis was apparent Friday as fighting raged  ahead of the Sunday cease-fire deadline.  Separatists intensified efforts to capture the key railroad  junction of Debaltseve from Ukrainian forces, pounding the city  with heavy artillery barrages. At least 25 people were reported  killed.  The upsurge in fighting and casualties reflected a last-ditch  effort to take or recover territory before all guns are supposed to  fall silent at one minute after midnight Sunday local time.  Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of sending fresh  reinforcements to the separatists in recent days, including a  convoy of 70 armored personnel vehicles and mounted guns.  A senior Ukrainian military official, Petro Mekhed, said Moscow had  deployed at least 10,000 soldiers to the conflict.  Putin has denied sending troops or weapons, despite NATO satellite  surveillance photos showing armored columns crossing from Russia  into Ukraine.  Putin has said only ""volunteers"" from Russia have gone to aid the  separatists.  Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko negotiated with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois  Hollande for 16 hours Wednesday and Thursday to craft the  cease-fire deal.  The truce sets out the same timetable and disarmament objectives  outlined in a Sept. 5 peace accord that the warring factions then  promised to fulfill but didn't.  Under the new plan, heavy weapons and foreign fighters should be  withdrawn within two weeks after the cease-fire starts, and  elections should be held under Ukrainian law in separatist-held  regions, which are supposed to be granted more autonomy by the  Ukrainian parliament by the end of the year.  Obama administration officials insist they are deeply involved in  the Ukraine diplomacy. They say they spoke by phone to European  leaders during the talks and Obama conferred with Merkel last  Monday at the White House.  ""It would be inappropriate or a misperception to say we have not  been in the game,"" a top administration official said Thursday.  Yet, administration officials also made clear in statements and a  new national security blueprint that they want America's partners  in Europe to do more heavy lifting, and they think warnings about  Russia's intentions are overblown.  National Security Adviser Susan Rice, discussing the new strategy  on Feb. 6, said Americans are being ""buffeted by alarmism."" Current  security threats, while serious, are not ""existential"" like those  from the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, she said in a speech.  Administration insiders also argue there's little point in Obama  spending time trying to influence Putin when the Russian leader has  shown no willingness to compromise.  With crises around the world, and limited time left in his term,  Obama should focus on priorities like completing a nuclear deal  with Iran, or the opening to Cuba, which could contribute to his  legacy, they say.  U.S. officials say they are satisfied with the approach. Some  European diplomats say they're not sure the Americans would want to  sit at the table if asked.  ""We have clearly outsourced this to the Europeans,"" said Heather  Conley, a former State Department official now at the Center for  Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  ---------- prichter@tribune.com Credit: By Paul Richter and Carol Williams, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: Pro-Russian rebels in Gorlovka fire missiles from a Grad  launch vehicle toward Ukrainian forces in Debaltseve on Friday.

217,993076362.xml,"      It's not an introduction you'd expect from a  presidential contender. But when French Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande stepped off a train on a recent visit to London,  he did so with the words ""I am not dangerous."" The bespectacled 57-year-old, who is running against President  Nicolas Sarkozy, is barely known outside France. Even at home he  was long best known as the supportive partner of fellow Socialist  politician Segolene Royal. Now, though, opinion polls put him ahead  of Sarkozy, a center-rightist, in the election whose first round  will be  April 22.  For many in the European financial markets, Hollande's promise to  impose a 75 percent tax on high earners, split investment banks  from retail banks and focus on economic growth is a threat.  In his first major campaign speech,  he declared: ""In the battle  ahead, my main adversary has no name, no face and no party. He will  never run as a candidate. He will never be elected, but he rules in  spite of all that. My adversary is the world of finance.""  If Hollande wins, warns George Magnus, a senior economic adviser at  investment bank UBS, the market's current tranquillity ""will  evaporate."" Not solely because of his demands, but because he might   convince other European governments it's time to deviate from the  path of austerity and start spending.  Hollande, who did not give an interview for this article, styles  himself an ordinary man. A study of his track record, as well as  interviews with longtime friends, voters in his local constituency,  colleagues and advisers, suggests he might not be all that radical.  Without naming Hollande, Sarkozy has said his chief rival lacks  experience and ""lies morning and night.""  Hollande's supporters say he has to play a careful political game.  He needs left-wing support to win the election. But at heart, his  supporters say, he is a congenial pragmatist who will look for  compromise.  ""Every president is the product of a moment in time,"" said Claude  Bartolone, a long-serving member of Parliament who joined  Hollande's campaign team last year.  In the early hours of a Sunday morning in Paris last year, Hollande  learned his life had changed. According to friends, his partner,  Valerie Trierweiler, shook him out of a deep slumber and told him  that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a fellow Socialist, the head of the  International Monetary Fund and runaway favorite to become the next  president, had been arrested on sexual assault charges in New York.  Though the charges were dropped, it made Hollande suddenly the  front-runner to become the country's first Socialist president  since Francois Mitterrand in 1981.  In a campaign book published in February, ""Changing Destiny,""  Hollande acknowledged that his prospects got a boost from the  ""candidate who never showed up."" He also has been keen to emphasize  how his lifestyle differs from that of his globe-trotting rival.  On Fridays, when he shuttles to the Correze region in southern  France, the heart of his political constituency, he sleeps behind a  blue door in his parliamentary offices. It's a room so drab that  its most extravagant item is a brown electric trouser-press that  looks as though it dates to the 1970s. A metal bed is draped with a  blue-and-white quilt and flanked by two nondescript bedside tables.  There's an alarm clock, a wicker chair and a chunky old TV.  Hollande usually arrives by plane from Paris late Thursday or early  Friday and rarely leaves without shaking dozens of hands and  kissing dozens of cheeks at Tulle's open-air market Saturday  morning. ""He knows almost everyone, the sellers and the shoppers,""  said Tulle Mayor Bernard Combes, 52, who met Hollande at a village   festival and quit his job as a schoolteacher a decade ago to work  with him.  Hollande is often seen at the Caleche cafe, around the corner from  his constituency office. On Saturday mornings he slides into a  horseshoe-shaped sponge-plastic seat for his customary ""grand cafe  et croissant.""  Correze is a semimountainous region that takes its name from the  river that runs through it. Before Hollande, it was the political  fiefdom of former President Jacques Chirac.  Like Chirac before him, Hollande is convinced of the need to  maintain a base away from Paris and not change constituency with  each election. ""He can take the true temperature here,"" said  Jacques Spindler, communications director for the Correze General  Council. ""People won't just tell him what he wants to hear.""  Hollande was born into a middle-class family in Rouen, a midsize  town northwest of Paris, and started his education in a private  Catholic school. In 1968, the year France held a general strike and  Paris was convulsed by student protests, his father, an eye-and-ear  doctor who got into property investment, uprooted his family of two  children to take them to Boulogne, an affluent Parisian suburb.  For Hollande, 13 at the time, the shift was striking. According to  ""Secret Journey,"" a biography published last year, Georges Hollande  threw out his sons' metal dinky cars and lead soldiers as part of  the move.  But the move to Paris also marked the start of a highflying  education: Hollande picked up diplomas at the HEC business school,  Europe's top-rated, followed by the highly acclaimed political  studies institute Sciences Po and the Ecole Nationale  d'Administration, traditional training ground for the country's top  public servants. At ENA, students tackle everything from economics  to industrial relations and negotiation techniques. Hollande  qualified in the top 10.  It was also there, at 25, that he met fellow student Segolene  Royal, who would become his partner for decades and run for  president in 2007. Jean-Marie Petitclerc, a priest who works in  some of France's most notorious slums, remembers them as a socially  conscientious pair, working together in a high-rise housing  project.  Politically, Hollande opposed his father, who objected to France  letting go of its Algerian colony in the 1960s and ran for the  extreme-right political movement of the time. Despite that,  Hollande recently said that if he won the election, the first  person he would phone would be his dad. (His mother died three  years ago.)  Hollande's poor sight earned him a waiver from obligatory military  service -- a decision he contested, biographer Serge Raffy said,  because he already had political ambitions and believed failing to  serve would damage his prospects. Some of his closest friendships  were formed during military service in Britanny in the late 1970s,  when he shared a dorm with people like Michel Sapin, a former  finance minister who is now in charge of devising his election  platform.  Royal and Hollande had four children. She announced their breakup  after she lost to Sarkozy and even ran against Hollande in this  campaign but lost in the party primary. Hollande's current partner,  Trierweiler, is a 47-year old journalist whom he knew before Royal  announced their split.  If elected, Hollande would take over in France at a critical time  for Europe. The leaders of the eurozone are struggling to address  the bloc's debt crisis.  It's here that Hollande's policies raise most concerns for  proponents of austerity, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and  financial investors. Chief among their worries  is the fact that  Hollande has pledged to renegotiate a deal struck by Sarkozy and  Merkel with other European leaders on budget control. He argues  that it needs to encourage growth as well as savings.  That annoys Merkel, who has endorsed Sarkozy.  At Sarkozy's  request, she has refused to meet Hollande, according to a German  official. The leaders of Britain, Spain and Italy have not met him  either.  Hollande has said he wants to move away from the Paris-Berlin  duopoly known as ""Merkozy"" -- after the combined names of the  countries' leaders -- that has driven Europe's policy for the past  two years. In a December speech to Socialists in Berlin, he said  decisions ""cannot be limited to a few meetings of heads of state.""  Hollande's opponents say such ideas show naivete and lack of  statesmanship. His allies argue his stance stems from a deeply  pro-European, democratic view: He favors integration to the point  of federalism.  Hollande's bid to renegotiate Europe's budget pact does not mean he  wants to derail the new treaty, his aides say. ""Francois Hollande  is a European who wants to change Europe while remaining totally  pro-European,"" said Pierre Moscovici, his election campaign  director.  That tension -- between internal political goals, the demands of  investors and shared European aims -- is one all European leaders  face. If Hollande wins, Merkel's advisers say, she believes she can  work with him.  For Hollande, for now, the point is that every opinion poll since   May has pointed to him winning the election runoff, due May 6. That  might change. But if he gets there, says  longtime friend Jean-Yves  Le Drian, ""it will have been one hell of an adventure.""

218,1533930168.xml,"       Under the pall of another territorial  crisis in Europe, President Barack Obama and a cast of world  leaders tried to set aside grievances Friday to commemorate the  common cause and military might that turned the tide of war against  global oppression seven decades ago. As jets flew missing-man formations in the sky and guns fired  booming salutes, Obama joined more than a dozen world leaders --  including European heads of state, Queen Elizabeth II and his  current rival on the world stage, Russian President Vladimir Putin  -- for emotional ceremonies on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day  landings.  Speaking in a cemetery for U.S. servicemen killed in the invasion,  the president recalled how more than 160,000 U.S. and Allied troops  stormed ashore and yet failed to capture any of their objectives on  that first, longest day.  The Battle of Normandy ultimately claimed more 425,000 Allied and  German casualties.  ""We say it now as if it couldn't be any other way. But in the  annals of history, the world had never seen anything like it,""  Obama said, looking out over nearly 10,000 U.S. grave markers on  the cliffs overlooking Omaha Beach.  Hundreds of veterans and their families came, several sitting  behind the president in old military uniforms, their hands resting  on canes.  When Obama expressed his thanks for their service, they rose  slowly, if they could, to accept the applause.  But amid the tributes to the young men who faced and fell to  withering fire on the beaches and bluffs, private conversations  focused on more current violence.  After snubbing the Russian leader earlier in the week, Obama met  briefly with Putin on Friday for the first face-to-face encounter  between the two leaders since the crisis in Ukraine sent their  already rocky relationship into a spiral.  At the secluded Chateau de Benouville, the countryside estate where  a coterie of world leaders, kings and queens broke from a public  program of D-Day ceremonies for lunch, Obama and Putin talked as  they huddled by a doorway.  The meeting Friday was brief and unscripted, the White House said,  lasting about 15 minutes after a lunch hosted by French President  Francois Hollande.  But it marked another twist in the drama-filled relationship  between two leaders with no love lost and no way to work around the  other.  According to Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser,  Obama urged Putin to recognize the newly elected president of  Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, as the legitimate leader, ""ceasing  support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and stopping the  provision of arms and materiel across the border.""  Rhodes said Obama ""made clear that a failure to take these steps  would only deepen Russia's isolation.""  TV footage of the pair talking suggested Putin appeared to  interrupt Obama at times, although it's unclear what he said.  Just before they met, Putin was seen talking to Poroshenko at the  lunch.  Officials later said Putin and Poroshenko discussed arranging a  formal cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where gunbattles between  government supporters and Russian-backed separatists have claimed  dozens of lives, as well as other steps to ease tensions in a  crisis that first erupted in March when Russian forces seized the  Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine.  ""They spoke out in favor of the soonest stop to the bloodshed ...  and also of the cessation of hostilities,"" Putin's spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov, told ITAR-Tass, a Russian news service.  A Poroshenko spokeswoman, Irina Friz, gave further details on her  Facebook page.  She said negotiations were to start Sunday for a plan to take joint  action to ""prevent constant Ukrainian border crossing by Russian  militants,"" among other goals.  A senior Obama administration official, who briefed reporters later  on condition he not be identified, called the discussion ""a  positive development"" but not a substitute for Putin formally  recognizing Poroshenko's election.  The official said Ukraine's election ""provided for a new basis of  legitimacy for the government. It provides a new interlocutor"" for  Putin. ""There is a window open here.""  U.S. and European leaders initially vowed to isolate Russia  politically and economically -- hoping that sanctions and other  pressure would persuade Putin to stop aiding separatists in other  parts of eastern Ukraine.  Now, with Putin pulling troops off the Ukrainian border and a newly  elected leadership in Kiev, White House officials say they're no  longer trying to ramp up pressure but are working at persuading  Putin to take other steps.  That requires engaging with Putin.  Even as the U.S. and Europeans shut Putin out of the G-7 summit  Thursday in Brussels, Obama watched three of his closest allies --  France's Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British  Prime Minister David Cameron -- book their own private session with  the Russian leader.  Obama spent much of the week reassuring nervous allies in Eastern  Europe that he would honor U.S. commitments for a joint defense  under the NATO treaty.  In his D-Day address Friday, Obama seemed to aim some of his  sharpest notes at the current culture and crisis.  Today it has ""never been more tempting to pursue narrow  self-interest and slough off common endeavor,"" he said, adding,  ""whenever the world makes you cynical, stop and think of these  men.""  ""In our age of instant commentary, the invasion would have been  swiftly and roundly declared, as it was by one officer, 'a  debacle,' "" Obama said, according to prepared remarks. ""But a race  to judgment does not take into account the courage of free men.""  ---------- khennessey@tribune.com Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey, Tribune Washington Bureau Caption: Photo: President Barack Obama, front, from left, Queen Elizabeth II  of Britain, French President Francois Hollande, Queen Margrethe of  Denmark and Russian President Vladimir Putin take part in a  photograph of world leaders at the 70th D-Day anniversary  ceremonies Friday in France.

219,1633776642.xml,"       CBS stations pulled from Dish in contract dispute Millions of Dish Network customers lost easy access to CBS  programming late Friday after the two media companies failed to  agree on a new contract.   Negotiations went down to the wire and continued 24 hours beyond a  Thursday deadline set by CBS. Negotiations continued Friday before  the two sides reached an impasse.   ""Effective today at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, CBS programming is no  longer available to Dish subscribers in New York City, Los Angeles,  San Francisco, Sacramento, Dallas, Denver, Boston, Chicago,  Pittsburgh and several other markets,"" CBS said in a statement.  ""CBS has been negotiating a carriage agreement with Dish for six  months and has already granted two extensions. During this time,  Dish has dragged its feet at our many attempts to negotiate in good  faith.""   Without an agreement in place, Dish was not authorized to  retransmit signals of CBS-owned television stations to its  customers in 14 markets.   The accelerated pace of talks during the last few days suggested  that both sides were motivated to reach an accord.   Dish doesn't want to lose CBS, the nation's No. 1 television  network, which boasts such popular shows as ""The Big Bang Theory""  and ""NCIS,"" as well as college and professional football games.   But the complexity of any pact -- along with complications over  whether Dish would disable its controversial ad-skipping Hopper  technology -- apparently proved too much to tackle in a compressed  time frame. CBS has complained for weeks that Dish was not  negotiating with a sense of urgency.   70 Chinese held in Kenyan cybercrime investigation   More than 70 Chinese nationals have been detained by Kenyan police  investigating allegations of cybercrime, operating private radio  services and being in the country illegally, their attorneys said  Friday.   China's Foreign Ministry said it was aware of the arrests and would  cooperate.   ""The Kenyan police have detained our clients for further  investigations,"" said lawyer Ian Maina.   The attorneys said their clients were detained Tuesday and  Wednesday in a residential district of Nairobi.   Germany's Left Party takes state's reins   BERLIN -- The reform communist Left Party took power in a German  state on Friday for the first time since reunification, ending a  quarter-century of conservative rule in Thuringia and raising the  chance of a left-wing threat to Chancellor Angela Merkel in the  next federal vote.   The Left, which traces its roots to the Socialist Unity Party that  ruled East Germany, will run the state southwest of Berlin with the  center-left Social Democrats and Greens in a three-way coalition.   2 decades later, arrests made in Bosnia killings   Fifteen former Serb paramilitaries and soldiers were arrested in  Serbia and Bosnia on Friday for the 1993 murder of 20 people --  mainly Muslims.   In one of the most notorious episodes in the Bosnian war, the  victims were forced off a train passing through Bosnia, then  robbed, tortured and executed.   Evidence has since emerged that political officials in Serbia knew  that forces planned to seize train passengers and possibly use them  in exchange for prisoners or their dead comrades.   Former Queen Fabiola of Belgium dies at age 86   BRUSSELS -- Belgium's Queen Fabiola, widow of King Baudouin and  queen between 1960 and 1993, died Friday at age 86, the royal  palace said.   The Spanish-born queen had been ill for some time and her breathing  never fully recovered from an infection in 2009.   ""Their majesties the King and Queen and the members of the royal  family announce with very great sadness the death of Her Majesty  Queen Fabiola,"" a statement from the royal palace of King Philippe  said.   THE NEWSMAKER   ICC withdraws charges against Kenya president   Prosecutors dropped charges of crimes against humanity against  Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday, marking a failure for  the International Criminal Court in the high-profile case. Kenyatta  was accused of fomenting ethnic violence after the 2007 election.   Families of MH17 crash victims seek U.N. probe   AMSTERDAM -- Relatives of MH17 crash victims, angered by what they  see as Dutch mishandling of inquiries into the disaster, want a  special U.N. envoy to launch an international investigation.   A letter sent to Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday said Dutch  officials failed to build a case. They asked that inquiries be  handed over to the United Nations.   Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed July 17 over eastern  Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew, two-thirds of them  Dutch.   HOLOCAUST FUND   $60M   Amount France agreed Friday to put into a fund managed by the  United States to compensate Holocaust victims deported by French  state rail firm SNCF to Nazi death camps, a deal that protects it  from future U.S. litigation. About 76,000 Jews were arrested in  France during World War II and transported in railway boxcars to  concentration camps such as Auschwitz, where most died.   Crow Nation joins states fighting emissions rule   The leader of the Crow Nation in Montana joined 17 state attorneys  general Friday in challenging the Obama administration's effort to  reduce carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent, saying it  would cripple the tribe's already fragile economy.   Crow Chairman Darrin Old Coyote said the administration's new  regulations would vastly reduce the tribe's coal exports to power  plants.

220,420145982.xml,"          When he first ran for the job seven years ago, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told voters that if he did not succeed in significantly reducing the number of unemployed, they should consider him a failure and give someone else a chance.    Since then, the ranks of the unemployed have grown by nearly a million, and a gloomy electorate appears ready to take Schroeder at his word.    The race has tightened considerably in the closing weeks, but heading into Sunday's election, polls showed Schroeder trailing his Christian Democratic challenger, Angela Merkel, by about 6 to 8 percentage points.    If the lead holds up, Merkel would become Germany's first female chancellor, and the first to come from the former East Germany.    ""I'm pretty sure Merkel will be the chancellor on Monday morning, but it is unclear what kind of coalition she can form,"" said Manfred Guellner, director of Forsa, one of Germany's leading polling organizations.    Cumbersome coalition    Merkel's preferred coalition partner is the Free Democratic Party, or FDP, but most polls suggest that the combined vote total for the Christian Democrats and the FDP will fall just short of the absolute majority needed to form a center-right government. Instead, Merkel may be forced to settle for a cumbersome ""grand coalition"" with the Schroeder-less Social Democratic Party, or SPD.    The mood across Germany going into Sunday's election was one of pessimism, frustration and contradiction.    ""I voted for Schroeder last time, but this time I'll vote for Merkel and the Christian Democrats,"" said Dieter Sonnenberg, 51, an engineer in the oil and gas industry. ""It's not that I have a lot of confidence in her, but if Schroeder continues to run the country, nothing will change.""    Voters fault Schroeder's party    Sonnenberg echoes the mood of many voters, according to Guellner, whose tracking polls indicate that voters still prefer Schroeder on a personal level but are unhappy with his party. The same polls also suggest that a majority of Germans recognize the need for reform but are deeply suspicious of it.    ""A lot of people are frustrated with the old government, but they have no hope for Merkel,"" Guellner said. ""She's not young, she's not dynamic, she's not modern, and that's going to be a problem.""    Merkel, 51, a former physicist, has been a tentative and somewhat unexciting campaigner. She spells out her economic reform proposals in clinical detail and cautions that there are no quick fixes.    Schroeder's biggest problem has been the economy. While large German companies continue to post healthy profits, the unemployment rate has soared to 11.6 percent overall and more than 20 percent in the former East Germany as tens of thousands of jobs are outsourced to Eastern Europe and Asia.    ""I won't vote for either of them,"" said Marc Knierim, a 33-year- old Berliner. ""Schroeder has failed, but I wouldn't want to vote for Merkel. She isn't going to change anything.""    Knierim, who is unemployed, is taking some business courses in hopes of finding a job, but he says he is pessimistic about his chances. In the last election in 2002, he voted for Schroeder.    ""This time, I am voting for the Greens,"" he said, referring to the Green Party, the junior partner in Schroeder's coalition.    Last hurrah?    A few weeks ago, there was a whiff of the last hurrah in Schroeder's performance on the campaign trail. But after his clear- cut triumph over Merkel in a televised debate on Sept. 4, their only one-on-one encounter, the 61-year-old chancellor surged in the polls and began campaigning as if he really believed he could win.    ""He's in good spirits and he's very energetic,"" said Bela Anda, Schroeder's spokesman. ""We are on the right track.""    Most pollsters forecast that he will come up short, with 34 percent or 35 percent of the vote, to 42 or 43 percent for Merkel's Christian Democrats. The FDP is expected to get 6.5 percent to 7 percent of the vote, so the combined total for the Christian Democrats and the FDP is in danger of falling below a 50 percent majority needed to form a government.    The likeliest outcome, according to many pollsters and pundits, is a grand coalition of the Christian Democrats and SPD that would be led by Merkel.    ""It's the worst thing that can happen,"" said Roland Koch, the Christian Democratic governor of the state of Hesse. ""Both parties cannot work together ... to manage the economic challenges of Germany. It's impossible to bring both together.""    Manfred Wilke, a political analyst at the Berlin Free University, agreed that a grand coalition probably would prolong the stalemate over reforms, but he also noted that a majority of the electorate likely would be content with such a coalition and would expect the two main parties to work together.    ""Unlike Americans, Germans believe that when there are problems, the state has to solve the problems,"" he said.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Campaign billboards in Mainz, Germany, tout chancellor candidates Angela Merkel and Oskar Lafontaine.

221,420486507.xml,"         A strange thing happened after Angela Merkel squeezed Gerhard Schroeder out of power last fall in an election that was as bitter and as close as the U.S. presidential race in 2000. Her popularity soared. Germans took to Merkel, though she often comes across as a dour technocrat.    The honeymoon didn't last, though. Merkel's support has fallen below 40 percent, according to a recent poll. Support for her party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), stands at just 31 percent, closely followed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) at 30 percent. In the beginning of this year, the SPD trailed the CDU by at least 14 percentage points in polls.    Merkel seems to be experiencing what Schroeder faced: The German public is impatient for evidence that the nation will thrive under reunification of East and West, and that the government will resolve some long-term financial problems.    Merkel may help to create public frustration because she tends to be super-cautious. But she can point to some achievements. She has largely repaired relations with the U.S., which were deeply strained when Schroeder was chancellor. She saved a compromise on the new European Union budget. She has shown an independent, self-confident attitude toward Russia; Schroeder at times seemed far too cozy with the increasingly autocratic President Vladimir Putin.    Germany, though, has not made much progress on deep problems with the social welfare system, government spending and unemployment. Merkel came to power by agreeing to a grand coalition with Schroeder's Social Democrats. So any substantial change in domestic policy will face political opposition from some faction she needs. And like U.S. voters, Germans want these problems fixed--but aren't necessarily going to be happy with how that will be done.    Many Germans aren't happy with Merkel's plans to increase Germany's value-added tax to 19 percent from 16 percent. Perhaps she will get a boost from news last week that Germany's economy grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter. That may sound anemic, but it was the best quarter Germany has seen in five years.    Not that she will have a ready chorus to cheer the news. Several powerful state governors in her own party are waiting for Merkel to falter. She's not part of their old network--she's a woman, and she's from the East. For their part, SPD leaders are coalition partners out of necessity, not loyalty. They want to return to power.    The grumblers in her own party won't take her on yet, and the grand coalition isn't likely to break soon. But patience in Germany looks to be wearing thin.  ",2006-08-25
222,1543264442.xml,"       Afghan candidate rejects results before release KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah has pre-emptively rejected the results of last month's election, set to be officially released Monday, saying the country's electoral commission was involved in widespread fraud that tarnished the legitimacy of the runoff vote.    ""Unless the clean votes are separated from those that are fraudulent, we will not accept the election results,"" Abdullah said at a news conference Sunday night. ""We will refer to the people"" on how to respond to Monday's announcement.    The stakes are high for a peaceful transfer of power, which would mark the first since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The fragile government here continues to battle a nationwide Taliban insurgency as foreign troops prepare to withdraw by the end of the year.    Abdullah's statement comes amid heightened concerns that the election outcome could plunge Afghanistan into further violence, possibly along ethnic lines. Abdullah, a former foreign minister who fought against Soviet forces, is of Tajik and Pashtun ethnicity. But he has been more associated with his mother's Tajik heritage, and Tajik communities have shored up support for his candidacy. His rival, former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, is a Pashtun who commands widespread support among the Pashtun populations in the country's southern and eastern regions.    Abdullah's campaign has called for a far-reaching recount of votes in several provinces where Ahmadzai's support is strong and where it says election officials rigged ballot boxes in favor of Ahmadzai.  Libya delays announcing voting results until July 20    Libya will announce results of last month's parliamentary elections July 20, the head of the elections commission said Sunday, pushing back the results another week.    Fewer than half of registered Libyans voted, reflecting disillusionment with the chaos since Moammar Gadhafi's overthrow. The government and outgoing parliament have failed to ensure security and curb militias that helped oust Gadhafi.    The North Africa oil producer voted June 25 in an election marred by violence.  N.Y. firefighter killed battling high-rise blaze    NEW YORK -- A New York City firefighter recently honored for saving the life of a boy was killed battling an electrical blaze at a high-rise building that began in a dangerously cluttered apartment, officials said Sunday.

Merkel says U.S. spying allegations are serious    BEIJING -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that allegations that a German man worked as a double agent for U.S. intelligence were serious and, if true, were a clear contradiction of what cooperation between partners is supposed to be about. She made the comments at a news conference while on a visit to Beijing.    The White House has declined to comment on the arrest of an employee of Germany's foreign intelligence agency.

Pope to hold 1st meeting with sex abuse victims    VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis on Monday holds his first meeting with victims of sexual abuse by priests, an encounter that some say should have happened long ago, and victims from his native Argentina say they are pained over their exclusion.    Six victims, two each from Ireland, Britain and Germany, will attend the pope's private morning Mass in his Vatican residence and then meet with him afterward, according to people who organized the meeting.

223,1716891732.xml,"       With its Syria policy in tatters and Europe alarmed at a tide of refugees, the Obama administration and its allies are contemplating a policy shift that once seemed unthinkable: a peace formula that would allow Syrian President Bashar Assad to remain in office, at least on an interim basis. Assad's future, and a possibly revamped U.S. strategy on Syria, are expected to be high on the agenda as the United Nations General Assembly meets Monday in New York and President Barack Obama sits down with Russian President Vladimir Putin.     Russia appears to be doubling down on its support for Assad, bolstering military aid to Damascus just as the West is wavering on its insistence that Assad must go.     The future of Assad has long been the major sticking point in resolving the Syrian conflict, which has become a multisided proxy war pitting the United States and its partners against the Assad government and its principal backers, Russia and Iran.     The European refugee crisis -- which has seen the effects of the more than four-year Syrian War spill onto Europe's frontiers -- has added urgency to jump-starting long-stalled peace talks. Many now see a place for Assad at the negotiating table, not sidelined with pariah status.     Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stunned many when she said that engaging with Assad was necessary.     ""We will have to talk with many actors,"" Merkel said after a European Union summit in Brussels. ""Assad will be part of that.""     Germany is expecting as many as 1 million asylum applicants this year, many from Syria. The flood of arrivals has also stretched resources in Greece, the Baltic states and Hungary, among other nations.     ""If we reach a deal on a transition authority and Assad is part of it, then it will be necessary to talk with him in his capacity as an actor in this process,"" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Friday in an interview in the French daily Le Monde. He added, though, that any Assad presence would have to be transitory.     ""Assad must go; he can't be part of Syria's future,"" Britain's top diplomat said, echoing longtime British and U.S. aims.     The Obama administration has not pulled back on its ""Assad must go"" ultimatum, first voiced by Obama in August 2011, but recent comments suggest that the White House could countenance an Assad role in a transition administration.     ""It doesn't have to be on day one or month one,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said in London last week when asked about the prospective timing of Assad's leave-taking. ""There is a process by which all the parties have to come together and reach an understanding of how this can best be achieved.""     While cloaked in diplomatic-speak, Kerry's comments are a long way from the definitive denunciations that he made during the last, failed Syria peace talks, in early 2014 in Switzerland.     ""There is no way ... that the man who led the brutal response to his own people could regain the legitimacy to govern,"" Kerry said in the Swiss resort city of Montreux, referring to Damascus' crackdown on anti-government demonstrators.     Now, after tens of thousands of deaths, the militant takeover of vast swaths of Syria and a refugee crisis overwhelming Europe, a new tone appears to be emerging. Where it all will lead remains unclear, as all previous diplomatic efforts have collapsed.     Likely providing a framework for any Syrian peace talks is the so-called Geneva communique, hammered out in June 2012 and approved by Washington and Moscow. The document calls for the creation of a transitional government in Damascus, agreed to by ""mutual consent"" of opposing sides in the conflict, leading to a new constitution and, eventually, multiparty elections.     However, achieving mutual consent has thus far posed an insurmountable challenge.     Many opposition groups will balk at any Assad role. They say he has blood on his hands and should be brought before an international war crimes tribunal. Keeping Assad around may also be a hard sell to Washington's major Middle Eastern allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, the latter another major backer of the Syrian opposition. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia view Assad's close ties to Tehran as toxic to their interests.     ----------    patrick.mcdonnell@tribpub.com Credit: By Patrick J.

224,1026556293.xml,"      Exuberant supporters were still out celebrating Francois Hollande's election as president of France when the first fissures began opening in the Franco-German motor that drives the rest of Europe. While officials on both sides of the Rhine vowed to continue their close political cooperation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a blunt rejection Monday of Hollande's pledge to renegotiate a continentwide fiscal treaty to rein in public debt.    Nor would she countenance deficit spending to boost the economic growth that Europe so desperately needs, pouring cold water on another of Hollande's campaign promises. Growth could come only through ""structural reforms,"" the conservative Merkel said.   It was an awkward start for the European Union's newest but most important power couple, the leaders of its two biggest economies and political heavyweights who together hold the key to how Europe deals with its debt crisis.   The global economy now depends in major part on what results from the collision between rigid German insistence on fiscal rectitude and the wave of anti-austerity anger sweeping through Europe, with left-leaning Socialist Hollande riding its crest.   Analysts say that an eventual compromise is likely, even inevitable. For all her unyielding words, Merkel will find it difficult to ignore the burgeoning popular opposition across Europe to Berlin's prescription of deep cuts in public spending. Equally, Hollande will no doubt discover where the rhetorical luxuries of campaigning end and the tough realities of governing begin.   ""Germany, just like France, knows that the two have to get into a close relationship as soon as possible. Given the sovereign debt crisis, the pressure's extremely high for neither side to show any major policy differences,"" said Daniela Schwarzer of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""If Germany and France appear divided, the credibility of promises to rebuild the eurozone is harmed.""   The markets, alert for the first signal to beat a retreat, are unlikely to give Hollande and Merkel time to sort out their differences.   For now, the momentum is with Hollande after his defeat Sunday of President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was such a close ally of Merkel's that pundits dubbed the pair ""Merkozy."" Hollande is expected to take office May 15, becoming France's first Socialist president in 17 years.   Besides France, voters in economically sinking Greece threw their weight behind anti-austerity parties Sunday, while popular protests against austerity also have sprung up in financially troubled Spain, Italy and Portugal.   Significantly, calls for a bigger emphasis on reviving economic growth in Europe also have come from the heads of the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Experts say that even before Sunday's elections, Merkel had begun to see the writing on the wall.   Two weeks ago, she signaled her support for bolstering the European Investment Bank and EU funds for infrastructure projects. EU officials have recommended that the bank increase its lending capacity by $13 billion.   Merkel publicly backed fellow conservative Sarkozy for a second term and snubbed Hollande, refusing to see or speak to him during the campaign. She tried to make some amends Monday, telling reporters: ""I will receive Francois Hollande in Germany with open arms.""   ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu,, Aaron Wiener, and Kim Willsher, Tribune Newspapers Chu reported from London, Wiener from Berlin and Willsher from Paris.

225,1012736809.xml,"      Voters in Germany's most populous state dealt a decisive blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union on Sunday, according to exit polls and television projections, a potentially ominous preview of things to come for the chancellor in next year's federal election. The polls and projections indicated Merkel's party was mustering about 26 percent of the vote in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a drop from 35 percent in 2010 and 45 percent in 2005, the year she took office. The opposition Social Democrats and Greens, about 39 percent and 12 percent respectively, appeared to have secured enough votes to form a majority coalition.  The upstart Pirate Party, a group primarily devoted to Internet freedom, rode its recent surge in popularity to about a 7 percent vote share and won entry into its fourth consecutive state parliament. Merkel's national coalition partner, the Free Democrats, managed a better-than-expected 8 percent, above the 5 percent threshold needed for representation, while the far-left Left Party was kicked out of the statehouse with less than 3 percent.  Election results in North Rhine-Westphalia have been harbingers of change in the past. It was a loss in this state in 2005 that brought down the chancellorship of Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder.  The North Rhine-Westphalia election is particularly significant, both because of the state's importance in Germany and because the campaign was largely framed as a referendum on Merkel's austerity policies.  The Christian Democrats' candidate for governor, Norbert Roettgen, who serves as Merkel's environment minister and is often mentioned as a potential successor to the chancellor, announced late Sunday that he would resign as the local party chief.  On the campaign trail, Roettgen hammered at the need for budgetary restraint and criticized what he labeled the free-spending ways of the current governor, Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft, whose deficit-raising budget proposal brought down her minority government and forced Sunday's election.

Fianna Fail received 22.2% of the votes. Fine Gael, the party of incumbent Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, got 20.9%.Sinn Fein's left-wing proposals for tackling Ireland's housing crisis and creaking health care system proved a powerful draw for young voters in a country that is still dealing with aftershocks of the 2008 global financial crisis, which hammered its debt-driven ""Celtic Tiger"" economy.Vote counting resumed Monday to fill all the seats in the 160-seat Dail, the lower house of Ireland's parliament.With more than three-quarters of the seats in parliament filled, Sinn Fein had taken 37, Fine Gael 29 and Fianna Fail 27.No party is likely to reach the 80 seats needed for a majority, making some form of coalition inevitable. But forming a stable alliance looks tough.Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael had said before Saturday's election that they would not go into a coalition with Sinn Fein because of its links to past violence. Interior Dept. drops trophy hunting panel amid court fightWASHINGTON -- Facing significant legal challenges, the Trump administration has disbanded its advisory board created to help boost trophy hunting and relax federal rules for importing the heads and hides of African elephants, lions and rhinos.The International Wildlife Conservation Council was created by then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former Republican congressman from Montana forced to resign amid a corruption scandal.A 2018 investigation by The Associated Press showed that the board was stuffed with big-game hunters, including appointees with direct ties to President Donald Trump and his family.A coalition of environmental groups later sued, alleging that the board's one-sided makeup violated the law governing the creation of federal advisory boards. German politics upended as Merkel's heir apparent quitsBERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's heir apparent shook up German politics Monday by declaring she would quit as the governing party's leader.Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose flagging support dropped further after regional Christian Democratic Union lawmakers ignored the party's instructions, told senior CDU members she won't seek the chancellorship in next year's election. The decision upended Merkel's plan to hand Kramp-Karrenbauer the reins after more than 15 years as chancellor.The announcement followed days of party infighting over the election of a governor in the state of Thuringia. CDU legislators there defied Kramp-Karrenbauer's advance appeals and voted with the far-right Alternative for Germany party to oust a left-wing incumbent.

He entered the pleas in federal court in Lafayette, and sentencing is set for May 22.""Matthews admitted to setting the fires because of the religious character of these buildings, in a self-promotional effort to raise his profile as a 'Black Metal' musician by copying similar crimes committed in Norway in the 1990s,"" the U.S. Attorney's statement said.

227,420622968.xml,"      President Bush, who has long refused to commit the United States to specific limits on pollutants contributing to global warming, took a new turn Thursday in proposing that the U.S. and other leading nations by the end of next year set ""a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases."" That is what the president will recommend to a summit of the Group of Eight major industrial nations in Germany next week, along with appeals to match the U.S. in dramatically increasing funding to fight AIDS in Africa and promoting freer international trade. But with its lack of specifics, the president's plan for addressing climate change falls far short of what the other world leaders hope to deliver at the G-8 summit, set in a serene Baltic Sea resort in Heiligendamm, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an ardent advocate for averting global warming. At the same time, European wariness of U.S. military involvement in Iraq-along with Russian concerns about a U.S. buildup of missile defenses in Eastern Europe-could contribute to an environment in which the American president, nearing the end of his second term, will have difficulty mustering support for his initiatives, U.S. and European analysts say. ""The Bush administration is in a very bad situation,"" said Philippe Moreau Defarges, senior fellow at the Institute for International Relations in Paris. ""It seems that Mr. Bush is really in a quagmire in Iraq and nobody is really ready to listen to him. ... It's too late for Mr. Bush. I think a lot of leaders are waiting for the next president."" Bush has long resisted strong action on climate change. But polls show that Americans increasingly view it as a problem. Presidential candidates of both parties are embracing plans to address global warming, and Bush may be seeking a positive platform to offset a bitter war in Iraq. Even so, Bush's plan is vague by the standards of European leaders and is likely to disappoint those ready to commit to specifics this year, experts say. ""The reality is that everyone knows the Bush administration has only 18 months left,"" said Phil Clapp, president of the Washington-based National Environmental Trust. ""What Europe and Canada and the rest of the G-8 are trying to do is set up negotiations that will conclude"" with Bush's successor. The White House insists that Bush is accelerating a global agreement among nations that have long been at odds. As James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, put it, ""Let's speed up the clock, and in the 18 months, see if we can get agreement on the basic elements of this framework."" Bush said he is ready to start negotiating a framework on climate protection now, not only with the other G-8 nations- Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada, Russia and Japan-but also with fast-growing industrial powers such as China, India and Brazil. The U.S. proposes to invite a dozen or more nations responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions to negotiations to frame strategies in the next 18 months. ""The United States takes this issue seriously,"" Bush said Thursday in an address at the headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Under his plan, he explained, the U.S. and other nations would set a worldwide goal for reducing greenhouse gases, while each country would establish specific national strategies. Bush has refused to let the U.S. join the Kyoto Protocol. More than 150 other nations have signed the treaty requiring nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5 percent by 2012. For bigger industrial nations, that involves a 15 percent cut. Bush has rejected this as an unfair throttle on U.S. economic development, because some economic rivals such as China are not a part of the Kyoto accord. Yet the president has increasingly concluded that global warming is a problem. At the G-8 summit starting June 6, some European leaders are ready to commit to a 20 percent cut in energy consumption over 20 years and a pledge to prevent the average temperature of the Earth from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius. But in talks leading to the summit, U.S. negotiators have refused to accept those numbers. ""We believe that the industrialized nations must lead the way here,"" Merkel said this week in an appearance in Germany with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). ""I am pleased that there is a broad bipartisan movement under way in Congress which attaches great importance to the issue of climate and energy."" A new generation of leaders is taking charge in Europe, including Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown, the successorin- waiting to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Russia plans presidential elections in March in which two-term Vladimir Putin cannot run. Merkel is a leader among these new heads of state in pushing for faster action on greenhouse gases than Bush seems likely to accept. But climate change is not the only area where G-8 agreement may prove elusive. Bush announced this week that he will press the U.S. to double its commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa, seeking $30 billion in the second phase of a program which the U.S. started in 2003 with $15 billion. And he said Thursday he will call on G-8 leaders to join him in this commitment and other work, including the removal of international trade barriers, to lift up underdeveloped nations. But Bush risks intensifying the opposition with some of his appearances surrounding the G-8. He will go to Prague and Poland, as well as visiting Pope Benedict XVI in Rome. The U.S. is negotiating with Poland for an installation of missiles and with the Czech Republic for a radar site, parts of a missile defense system that the U.S. insists is intended to protect Europe from threats by Iran, but which Russia has denounced as a threat to itself. ""The president will be going to the Czech Republic first and then immediately after the summit he will be going to Poland,"" said Simon Serfaty, senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""That ... is a distinctive message which is understandable in Russian as easily as it is in English. ""The message is that we're going to do what we're going to do, and your concerns ... are not going to impress me."" ---------- mdsilva@tribune.com - - - IN THE WEB EDITION Tribune White House correspondent Mark Silva is traveling next week with President Bush in Europe.

That is the largest number of reported deaths from a single U.S. airstrike in Somalia since the Trump administration approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaida.Al-Shabab is blamed for last month's truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 350 people.A Somali intelligence official said U.S. drone aircraft fired at least eight missiles at al-Shabab bases and training camps in Bur-Eylada, a village situated between the towns of Dinsor and Burhakaba in the Bay region. The official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity, said senior al-Shabab commanders were among the dead.The U.S. this month also began targeting a small but growing ISIS presence in northern Somalia.Separately, Africa Command said it conducted two airstrikes near Fuqaha in central Libya against Islamic State group militants -- one Nov. 17 and another two days later.

230,419058882.xml,"      German voters rebuked the scandal-ridden Christian Democrats in a state election Sunday, leaving the conservative party's search for a new leader wide open in the process. Voters in Schleswig-Holstein, a rural state bordering Denmark, chose a new legislature in the first electoral test since the scandal blew up around former Chancellor Helmut Kohl late last year. Support for the Christian Democrats fell to about 35 percent from 37 percent four years ago, according to unofficial results released by German television. The Social Democrats won 43 percent, up from 40 percent in 1996. The Christian Democrats' loss in the legislature, which elects the state governor, mean that Volker Ruehe, Kohl's former defense minister, would not unseat two-term governor Heide Simonis. But his showing was better than opinion polls predicted, giving the Christian Democrats a needed boost. The party's general secretary, Angela Merkel, said the results show it is bouncing back. ""The CDU is out of the bottom of the valley,"" she said in Berlin. ""It's back in step and will naturally continue to fight."" Ruehe's lead in the race disappeared as the scandal unraveled in December with Kohl's admission that he had accepted illegal cash contributions in the 1990s. The admission has led to investigations into whether government decisions were bought. Ruehe has avoided taint in the scandal despite serving in senior positions in 1989-98--a time in which Kohl allegedly hid millions in undeclared campaign contributions. Ruehe insisted his chances to become party chairman are still alive, noting that his showing was considerably better than the party's national poll levels of 29 percent. The party will choose a new chairman in April.  ",2000-02-28
231,2073344893.xml,"Mesut Ozil said Sunday he had no regrets about his controversial photograph with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that sparked questions about his loyalty to Germany's national squad ahead of the World Cup.
Breaking his silence over the snapshot that caused outrage during the tournament, the Arsenal midfielder said in a statement on Twitter that he was loyal to both his Turkish and German origins and insisted he did not intend to make a political statement.
""Like many people, my ancestry traces back to more than one country. Whilst I grew up in Germany, my family background has its roots firmly based in Turkey,"" he said.
""I have two hearts, one German and one Turkish.""
Ozil said he had first met Erdogan in 2010 after the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel watched a Germany-Turkey match together.
""Since then, our paths have crossed a lot of times around the globe,"" he said.
""I'm aware that the picture of us caused a huge response in the German media, and whilst some people may accuse me of lying or being deceitful, the picture we took had no political intentions.""
Ozil said despite the timing of the picture with teammate Ilkay Gundogan and Erdogan -- shortly before the president won re-election in a poll endowing him with sweeping new powers -- ""it wasn't about politics or elections, it was about me respecting the highest office of my family's country"".
""My job is a football player and not a politician, and our meeting was not an endorsement of any policies,"" Ozil said.
""I get that this may be hard to understand, as in most cultures the political leader cannot be thought of as being separate from the person. But in this case it is different. Whatever the outcome would've been in this previous election, or the election before that, I would have still taken the picture.""
Ozil, 29, came in for stinging criticism in Germany for their shock first-round defeat at the World Cup.
Team boss Oliver Bierhoff suggested after the debacle that Germany should have considered dropping Ozil after his failure to explain himself over the Erdogan picture.
Bierhoff later backtracked, saying that he ""was wrong"" to put Ozil under undue pressure, but the picture continued to draw scorn from fans on social media.
Germany is home to more than three million people of Turkish origin.

232,1013912734.xml,"      For months, President Barack Obama has been urging his European allies to balance their zeal for spending cuts with policies to spur economic growth. His pleas have mostly been ignored. But now, as Obama prepares to host the Group of Eight summit Friday and Saturday, his pro-growth argument has taken on new force and some measure of desperation.    The G-8 gathering at Camp David will cover a range of topics, including food security for Africa and support for Arab countries in transition. But given the escalating crisis in Greece, the future of the eurozone is likely to dominate the talks, raising the stakes for the summit and for Obama.    If the volatile situation in Europe persists, or worsens, it could provide enough of a jolt to global markets and trade to undercut the U.S. economic recovery and Obama's prospects for re-election. He's certain to press the European leaders to move closer to his position during their meeting at the wooded presidential retreat outside Washington.    ""This summit is as much about the U.S. elections as the eurozone crisis,"" said Kati Suominen, a trans-Atlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a think tank in Washington. That puts a greater onus on Obama, she said, to lead the G-8, which is made up of the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Russia.    Three leaders will be at their first G-8 summit: Japan's Yoshihiko Noda, Italy's Mario Monti and new French President Francois Hollande, a longtime bureaucrat who unseated Nicolas Sarkozy on a platform of ending austerity. Hollande will meet with Obama Friday at the White House, which could provide clues on how hard the French Socialist leader will push a growth agenda, risking a rift with the pro-austerity Germans.    Obama will try to persuade the Europeans to head off a potential disaster in July when the Greek government must make a debt payment, financed by bailout funds from European and international institutions. Those contributions are contingent on Athens making spending cuts. But the political standoff in Greece, Hollande's win in France and voter resistance to budget cutting in northern Europe have exposed cracks in the Germany-led focus on belt-tightening.    ""Now the situation, the circumstances, are evolving,"" said Domenico Lombardi, a senior scholar at the Brookings Institution. ""The Europeans are becoming more receptive to the idea that austerity is really self-defeating.""    That said, nobody is expecting Germany's leader, Angela Merkel, or the European Union to shift course after a two-day meeting in the United States. Besides, the larger G-20, which includes emerging nations and holds its summit next month in Mexico, is the main forum for leaders on global economic strategy.    The White House has sought to lower expectations, seeking to frame the G-8 meeting as a low-key gathering. But events in Europe are forcing world leaders to reassess the key economic question of the day, austerity or growth, and the steps needed to steady a global economy still suffering from the 2008 financial meltdown.    Greece remains the epicenter of the crisis. Its recent failure to form a government, at the hands of anti-austerity proponents, is forcing a new election June 17 and propelling the country closer to leaving the 17-nation eurozone, something that would plunge the currency union and the global economy into uncharted waters.    Merkel has insisted she won't change the terms of the Greek bailout or abandon the EU's commitment to prudent fiscal policies. But she has shown more willingness to accept a growth strategy that would accompany the fiscal one, such as increasing infrastructure spending and giving indebted countries more time to get their fiscal houses in order.    White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama would urge the European leaders to ""address the need for growth in Europe and the need to put people to work, including and especially young people in Europe.""    By all accounts, Europe is better prepared to withstand a Greek exit from the eurozone than it was last fall, when debt problems preoccupied the G-20 summit. Since then, the European Central Bank has flooded the continent's financial system with cheap credit. And last month, a number of G-20 nations made pledges that doubled, to more than $700 billion, the International Monetary Fund's ""firewall"" to contain the problem.    Still, analysts say it would be a mistake to assume that Europeans have enough means to handle the crisis, should the problems of Greece spread to Italy and Spain. And they warn that a worsening of the eurozone's troubles would surely inflict pain on the U.S. economy.    ""The likelihood (of a Greek exit from the eurozone) is rising every day,"" said Barry Eichengreen, a University of California at Berkeley professor of economics and political science and a former senior policy adviser at the IMF.    He likens the situation to a car driving down an icy road. He sees Europe shifting from austerity to a more-balanced approach that supports growth.    ""That wheel is spinning slowly,"" Eichengreen said. ""But the other wheel, the crisis, is spinning fast. And you know what happens to a car when two wheels spin at different speeds. It careens out of control.""    At the G-8 summit, Obama will be giving directions, from the back seat.    ----------   dlee@tribune.com Credit: By Don Lee, Tribune Washington Bureau Caption: Photo: Afghan President Hamid Karzai and German Chancellor Angela Merkel sign a long-term strategic agreement Wednesday in Berlin.

233,1915062122.xml,"Armed doctor kills himself, 1 other at NYC hospital; 6 hurt PARIS -- A doctor who was forced out from a New York hospital because of sexual harassment accusations returned Friday with an assault weapon hidden under a lab coat and shot seven people, killing one woman in an attack that left several doctors fighting for their lives, authorities said.The gunman, Dr. Henry Bello, fatally shot himself after trying to set himself on fire at Bronx- Lebanon Hospital, they said. He staggered, bleeding, into a hallway where he collapsed and died with the rifle at his side, officials said.Witnesses described a chaotic scene as gunfire erupted, spreading terror throughout the facility, as employees locked themselves inside rooms and patients feared for their lives. ""I thought I was going to die,"" said Renaldo Del Villar, 55, a patient who was in an emergency room getting treatment for a lower back injury.Law enforcement officials identified the shooter as Bello, 45, who was described on the hospital website as a family medicine physician. Officials said Bello used an AR-15 in the attack on the 16th and 17th floors.One female doctor was killed and six others wounded -- five seriously, said Police Commissioner James O'Neill. The patients were treated in the emergency room.Bello was allowed to resign from the hospital in 2015 amid sexual harassment allegations, according to law enforcement officials. In unrelated cases, he was arrested in 2004 on a charge of sexual abuse, according to a police report. He was arrested again in 2009 on a charge of unlawful surveillance, after two women said he tried to look up their skirts with a mirror.The 120-year-old hospital is one of the busiest emergency rooms in the city. 22 of Trump's aides earn at least $179,700, White House reportsWASHINGTON -- More than 40 percent of White House staffers earn in excess of $100,000 a year, according to new salary details released Friday.A White House staff salary document shows that 22 of Trump's aides are earning $179,700. They include chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway.Also making $179,000: Omarosa Manigault, the former ""Apprentice"" contestant who serves as director of communications for the White House office of public liaison.Among those forgoing pay are Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.The White House has been required to report the salaries and staff titles to Congress every year since 1995. U.N. agrees to cut peacekeeping budget, a reduction U.S. soughtUNITED NATIONS -- The General Assembly on Friday agreed to a significant cut in the budget for the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping missions, a reduction that the Trump administration fought hard to achieve though it wanted an even larger decrease.After heated negotiations, the assembly's budget committee agreed to a $7.3 billion budget for 14 peacekeeping missions for the year starting Saturday, a $570 million cut from the current budget of $7.87 billion.The 193-member world body voted by consensus to approve $6.8 billion. It also agreed to an additional $500 million for two missions that are in the throes of downsizing -- the joint U.N.-African Union mission in Sudan's troubled western Darfur region and the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti. White House panel on voting fraud asks states for voter dataSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- President Donald Trump's commission investigating alleged voter fraud in the 2016 elections has asked states for a list of the names, party affiliations, addresses and voting histories of all voters, if state law allows it to be public.A Wednesday letter from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity gives secretaries of state about two weeks to provide the voter data. That also would include dates of birth, the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers and any information about felony convictions and military status.Some officials, including Virginia's governor and the secretaries of state in California and Kentucky, refused to comply, saying the request invades privacy and is based on false claims of fraud. German lawmakers vote to legalize gay marriageBERLIN -- German lawmakers voted Friday to legalize same-sex marriage, a move widely supported across the country that brings Germany in line with many of its Western peers.Chancellor Angela Merkel voted against the measure, but paved the way for its passage by allowing members of her conservative party to vote according to their conscience.Lawmakers voted 393-226 to legalize ""marriage for everybody,"" with four abstentions.Underlining the delicate political tightrope that Merkel walked, the ""no"" votes came entirely from her conservative bloc, although some prominent party members voted for it.""This is a historic day,"" said Greens lawmaker Volker Beck, who leapt to his feet to applaud once the result was announced and was showered with confetti by supporters. San Antonio officer dies of head wound after shootoutSAN ANTONIO -- A police officer in San Antonio died Friday of wounds suffered when he and his partner were shot by a man they intended to question about a vehicle break-in, police said.Officer Miguel Moreno, a nine-year veteran of the police force, was shot in the head during the encounter with the man Thursday.The gunman fired on Moreno and partner Julio Cavazos as they stepped out of their patrol car. Police have not released the name of the gunman. Cavazos also was shot but returned fire and attempted to pull Moreno out of the line of fire.Cavazos underwent surgery and is expected to recover, police Chief William McManus said Friday. ""I'm at a loss to describe what a tragedy this is,"" he said.The gunman died in the shootout. Four Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa plan to shutter Friday, following then-Gov. Terry Branstad's approval of a budget in May that stripped it of its Medicaid funding. The organization is also planning to close six clinics in Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming over concerns of political attacks, officials said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is giving the military chiefs another six months before they begin allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services. The delay does not affect troops already in the military. Mattis' decision Friday endorses a pact hammered out last week by the heads of the four branches.CAPTION: Photo: Chinese leader Xi Jinping rides past soldiers on an airstrip as he inspects troops Friday in Hong Kong.

234,2572434129.xml,"His party is the biggest in Germany. It has won all but three elections since 1950, including the past four. Its departing chancellor is more popular than any politician in the country. And German voters crave stability and continuity.  Armin Laschet, the conservative Christian Democratic Union party's candidate for chancellor, should be riding high. The race to replace Angela Merkel was his to lose.So far, he appears to be doing just that.Weeks before Germans vote on Sept. 26 in their most important election in a generation -- one that will produce a chancellor who is not Merkel for the first time in 16 years -- Laschet is sinking, and he is pulling his party down with him.The race is still close enough, and Germany's coalition politics so unpredictable, that it would be dangerous to dismiss the conservative candidate. But after recent polls showed Laschet's party dropping to record lows -- of 20% to 22% support -- his position is so dire that even some Christian Democrats have wondered aloud whether they picked the wrong candidate.Laschet's campaign has prompted queasiness among conservatives who fear they could be seeing a weakness in the party's appeal that has been disguised for years by Merkel's own popularity and is now exacerbated by her inability to groom a replacement.In 2018, she announced her personally chosen successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a moderate centrist. But even with Merkel's support, Kramp-Karrenbauer had trouble stepping out of the chancellor's shadow and building her own base. She quit in 2020 as leader of the conservatives, leaving the door open for Laschet.Laschet had long boasted that if he could run Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where he has been governor since 2017, he could run the country. But then extraordinary flooding this summer called even that credential into question, exposing flaws in his environmental policies and disaster management.""The biggest problem for Laschet is that he has not been able to convince voters that he can do the job like Merkel,"" said Julia Reuschenbach, a political scientist at the University of Bonn.She cited images of him laughing as the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, made a somber speech after devastating flash floods that killed 180 people, and posing before a mound of trash to make a statement of his own.""He comes across as uncertain, flippant and unprofessional,"" Reuschenbach said.In recent weeks, Laschet has seen his popularity drop below that of his Social Democratic rival, Olaf Scholz, while support for Laschet's party has been in a free fall since late July.The situation is so dire that Merkel, who had said she wanted to stay out of the race, is now intervening and trying to rally voters for Laschet.""Let's be honest: It is tight. It will be very tight in the coming weeks,"" Markus Söder, the head of the conservatives' Bavarian branch, the Christian Social Union, and an erstwhile rival, said at an election rally on Aug. 20 that was meant to propel Laschet's campaign into a final, intense stretch. ""It is no longer a question of how we could govern, but possibly of whether.""Söder openly challenged Laschet this year for the chance to succeed the chancellor, and he still enjoys a higher individual popularity rating among Germans than Laschet.Germans elect parties, not a chancellor candidate. But over the course of Merkel's four terms in office, her party has enjoyed the so-called chancellor bonus, meaning the willingness of voters to effectively cast a ballot for consistency.Although Merkel remains Germany's most popular politician, her recent attempts to drum up support for Laschet have failed to turn his fortunes around, partly because they have appeared last-minute and halfhearted.Instead, Scholz now appears to be reaping the incumbent benefit, playing up his closeness to Merkel to become the second most popular politician in the country.""Even conservative voters tend to approve of Mr. Scholz,"" said Ursula Münch, the director of the Academy for Political Education in Tützing.Yet Laschet is known for comebacks, for surviving blunders -- including making up grades for exam papers when he was lecturing -- and for his ability to turn around a sagging campaign in the final stretch.In the weeks before the 2017 vote in North Rhine-Westphalia, he focused on the need to increase security against a backdrop of record break-ins, to better integrate migrants and to reposition the state's industry to focus on the future. The strategy worked and he defeated the incumbent Social Democratic governor, whom he had trailed in the polls for most of the race.Among Laschet's influences is his faith. At a time when more and more Germans are quitting the Roman Catholic Church, Laschet is a proud member. ""I am not someone who uses Bible verses in my politics,"" he said. ""But of course it has influenced me."" And Merkel has praised his Christianity as a guiding moral compass.Another influence for Laschet is Aachen, Germany's westernmost city, where he was born and raised. Growing up in a place with deep ties to Belgium and the Netherlands, Laschet has been integrated into the larger European ideal all of his life. He still maintains a home in Aachen with his wife, Susanne, whom he met through their church choir and youth group. Together they have three grown children, including Joe Laschet, a social media influencer and fashionista for classic menswear.This January, Laschet fought to become the leader of the Christian Democrats, beating Söder, who remains a more popular politician with many Germans, but whether Laschet can save himself remains to be seen.He has had some successes, including a feisty appearance in the first televised debate and deftly dealing with an angry vaccination opponent who stormed the stage at a campaign stop. Laschet has also assembled a team of experts, including former rivals, like Friedrich Merz, who is well liked among the party's conservative wing, in an effort to show his bridge-building skills.But none of these things have made a dent in the widening gap with the Social Democrats.At a campaign stop in Frankfurt an der Oder, a woman wielding a cellphone pushed her way toward the candidate as he stood on a bridge overlooking the Polish border, making a statement to reporters about Germany's role in Europe.Asked if she intended to vote for Laschet, she demurred. ""I don't know yet who I will vote for,"" said the woman, Elisabeth Pillep, 44. ""But I don't think it will be him.""CAPTION: Photo: Christian Democratic Union candidate for chancellor Armin Laschet and German Chancellor Angela Merkel talk prior to the party leadership meeting Monday at the CDU's headquarters in Berlin.

235,2571400193.xml,"The federal prosecutor's office in Germany said Friday it was investigating who was responsible for a spate of hacking attempts aimed at lawmakers, amid growing concerns that Russia is trying to disrupt the Sept. 26 vote for a new government. The move by the prosecutor's office comes after Germany's Foreign Ministry said this week that it had protested to Russia, complaining that several state lawmakers and members of the federal parliament had been targeted by phishing emails and other attempts to obtain passwords and other personal information.Those accusations prompted the federal prosecutor to open a preliminary investigation against what was described as a ""foreign power.""The prosecutors did not identify the country but did cite the Foreign Ministry statement, leaving little doubt that their efforts were concentrated on Russia.In their statement, the prosecutors said they had opened an investigation ""in connection with the so-called Ghostwriter campaign,"" a reference to a hacking campaign that German intelligence says can be attributed to the Russian state and specifically to the Russian military intelligence service known as the GRU.Russia was found to have hacked into the German parliament's computer systems in 2015, and three years later it breached the German government's main data network.Chancellor Angela Merkel protested over both attacks, but her government struggled to find an appropriate response, and the matter of Russian hacking is now especially sensitive, coming in the weeks before Germans go to the polls to select a successor after her nearly 16 years in power.Moscow denied it was involved in the hacking efforts.""Despite our repeated appeals through diplomatic channels, our partners in Germany have not provided any evidence of Russia's involvement in these attacks,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said at a briefing Thursday.She called the German allegations ""an extraordinary PR story,"" and said the suspicions appeared to be the work of ""individual politicians"" intent on showing they would ""not allow gaps in trans-Atlantic solidarity,"" in an apparent reference to Germany's strong ties with the United States.Merkel is not running for reelection and will leave office after a new government is formed, meaning the election will be crucial in determining Germany's future -- and shaping its relationship with Russia.CREDIT: By Melissa Eddy, The New York Times",2021-09-11
236,1648245987.xml,"       Membership in a club brings benefits, but also responsibilities: You must pay your debts. If you can't, and reject a special offer to stay, be prepared for an uncomfortable conversation with the club president. Then say goodbye to your favorite leather chair by the fireplace. This is where Greece may be headed after Sunday's election: out the door of the eurozone. Greece's departure would be shocking and costly for Europe, but far riskier for Greece. It's no longer an inconceivable scenario, though. There's a word for it: Grexit.   Greek voters raised the possibility of departure by supporting the radical left-wing Syriza party, which promised to spring the country from the painful terms of its $270 billion bailout. The Greek economy was on the verge of collapse in 2010 when it accepted billions from Europe's leaders in exchange for a pledge to overhaul the economy. That meant slashing government spending and raising taxes. It hurt.   Five years into the era of pain, the Greek economy is still in terrible shape. Unemployment is at 25 percent and Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said Greece has had enough. He was sworn in as prime minister Monday at the head of a coalition declaring an end to ""the vicious circle of austerity.""   Ah, if it were so easy. Tsipras wants to renegotiate terms of the international bailout, slash Greece's enormous debt load and spend some of that money at home to alleviate suffering and get the economy moving. He would restore cuts to salaries and pensions and provide food stamps and other assistance to the poor. In a direct challenge to European authority, he's told the ""troika"" of bailout lenders calling the shots -- the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission -- that he doesn't plan to listen to them.   Europe's not pleased. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the rest of the eurozone's leadership constructed the continent's recovery from the financial crisis on the idea that sick nations would be nursed back to help, but they were required to change their profligate ways. If Tsipras reneges, that's not only a potential deal breaker for Greece, it also encourages Ireland, Portugal, Italy and other countries to cheat on their diets. Eventually Europe risks falling back into crisis mode.   Europe's leaders are signaling a willingness to talk to Greece about bailout terms and cut it some slack, but nothing like what Tsipras has in mind. ""The most important thing is that if you remain in the eurozone you stick to the rules we have. That's true for all countries,"" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, who chairs the euro group of finance ministers.   So what we have is either the makings of a brutal negotiation ending in a compromise ... or Grexit.   Tsipras, a 40-year-old former Communist, is a wild card who doesn't have a lot of time to make his intentions known. Loan repayment dates loom on the calendar. Most Europeans expect a deal, which is one reason international markets weren't roiled Monday by the election results.   But there's another reason for the lack of panic: Europe is in a much healthier position these days. The bailouts have largely worked, and the weaklings have come back from the edge. Richer countries also have built a new financial fortress to protect the eurozone. It includes a $500 billion emergency fund and a pledge from the central bank to do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the currency.   If Tsipras and Europe can't compromise, the two sides have some thinking to do. Consequences of an exit from the euro aren't predictable, but they are manageable. Europe would accept the losses on its loans, and get over the embarrassment that the grand idea of European currency unity has limits. Greece would get out from under its debt but face worse conditions in the short run, partly because the value of bank deposits in euros would collapse.   But Greece never made a strong candidate in the eurozone, and the austerity plan designed to save the country is a bust. With the return of the drachma, the price of Greek exports and cost of a Greek vacation would fall. The country could wind up with a shot at a better future, though it would be taking an enormous risk to find out.   European leaders need to show they mean business. Greece will need some breathing room, but it's not likely to win a vacation from economic reality because its citizens say they want one.   If the two sides can't agree on the terms of membership in the eurozone, they just may have to part ways.  ",2015-01-27
237,1708801452.xml,"       When Barack Obama's people announced last week that they are  searching worldwide for an architect for the Obama Presidential  Center in Chicago, they won no points for transparency. Martin Nesbitt, chairman of the Barack Obama Foundation, declined  to identify the firms that were invited to submit qualifications  for the center or to say how many were invited. He did reveal,  though, that most of them are American and several are from  Chicago.  Having consulted sources, I can now name 11 of the firms and  observe that they are A) of high caliber; B) represent a broad  geographic and aesthetic spectrum; and C) include the established  firms one would expect to be invited.  Two of the firms -- Ennead Architects and Robert A.M. Stern  Architects, both of New York -- designed the most recent  presidential libraries (a modern one for Bill Clinton and a  traditional one for George W. Bush). If Obama wants to make a fresh  statement, one has to wonder, why would he want them?  Renzo Piano, the architect of the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern  Wing and New York's new Whitney Museum, also received a request for  qualifications. Michelle Obama publicly praised his Whitney  building after touring it earlier this year. Piano, an Italian, is  the 1998 winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the field's  highest honor.  Another invited architect attended a White House dinner with the  Obamas. But it's not the presumed front-runner for the job, the  London-based, Tanzanian-born architect David Adjaye, who sat with  them during a 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David  Cameron.  It's the German-born Chicago architect Helmut Jahn, who in 2011 sat  at the Obamas' head table at a state dinner in honor of German  Chancellor Angela Merkel.  ""I had dinner at the White House with Obama, too,"" said Jahn, whose  projects include the United Airlines terminal at O'Hare  International Airport and the Mansueto Library at the University of  Chicago.  The rumor mill already has the job going to Adjaye, whose projects  include the under-construction National Museum of African American  History and Culture in Washington. It was easy to interpret the  global search as a way of opening the door for him. He would be the  first non-American architect to design an American presidential  library.  If, as expected, Adjaye is on the list of invited architects -- his  spokeswoman did not respond to an email -- his chances won't be  hurt by fortuitous timing: On Sept. 19, three days after the  deadline for architects to send in their qualifications, the Art  Institute will mount a major exhibit devoted to his work.  For President Obama and the first lady, who will jointly choose the  architect for the presidential center, the museum's imprimatur  could offer political cover. They could argue that Adjaye isn't  being picked because of his African background -- he's getting the  job because he's good.  But that choice won't be made until late this year or early next  year. For now, other invited firms aren't ready to cede the  project, which is expected to cost at least $500 million and be  built in Washington Park or Jackson Park. Fifty or more firms are  thought to have been invited.  ""I don't believe that Adjaye is a shoo-in,"" said Mark Sexton of the  Chicago firm Krueck+Sexton, whose projects include the elegantly  faceted Spertus Institute at 610 S. Michigan Ave.  Using a political metaphor to describe the architectural selection  process, Sexton added: ""It's a little like the Republican  primaries. ... Whoever is on top right now, it changes. There's a  long, long way before the election.""  Technically, the process is open to any architect. Organizers have  pledged that all submissions will be considered, regardless of  whether they are from architects who were invited to submit  qualifications.  Other Chicago firms invited to compete include Ross Barney  Architects, led by Carol Ross Barney, a key designer of the  downtown Riverwalk who has won plaudits for new Chicago Transit  Authority rapid-transit stations. That experience could help  because part of the Washington Park site is next to a CTA Green  Line station.  Another local contender is the Chicago office of Perkins+Will,  whose chief designer, Ralph Johnson, has already run the gantlet of  slipping a museum into cherished parkland. His credits include the  Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in Lincoln Park.  Open-space advocates have expressed concern that the presidential  center will disturb the pastoral atmosphere of Washington and  Jackson parks, both of which were designed by Frederick Law  Olmsted.  Also invited is Chicago's Tigerman McCurry Architects, headed by  Stanley Tigerman and Margaret McCurry. The firm brings intellectual  heft and a longtime commitment to design for the disadvantaged, a  quality that's relevant because the Obama center will be built near  impoverished South Side neighborhoods.  The non-Chicago firms asked to complete are equally impressive and  just as well-established.  Besides the Piano, Ennead and Stern firms, they include New York's  Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which co-designed New York's wildly  popular High Line; the San Francisco office  of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which shaped an acclaimed U.S.  Consulate  in the Chinese city of Guangzhou; and North Carolina architect  Philip Freelon, whose firm last year became part of Perkins+Will.  Freelon's entry will be independent of the firm's.  Freelon designed a critically praised Washington public library  that Obama toured this year.  Chicago architect Jeanne Gang declined to comment on whether she's  invited, as did the Los Angeles-area firm Morphosis, whose  principal Thom Mayne in 2005 won the Pritzker Architecture Prize.  Some Chicago architects said they would compete for the job even  though they weren't asked.  ""You know, what the hell? I'm going to submit anyway,"" said  architect Juan Moreno, who designed the brightly colored El Centro,  a satellite building for Northeastern Illinois University along the  Kennedy Expressway.  Posted online, the request for qualifications tells interested  firms to submit information including descriptions of three to five  relevant projects. At this point, entrants are not being asked to  provide designs.  Later this year, the president and first lady will select firms  that go on to the next round. That round will culminate when  finalists make actual proposals to the Obamas and they select an  architect. The foundation expects to reveal the winner in early  2016.  Will Chicago-style politicking influence the choice?  ""We realize that this isn't something you lobby for,"" Sexton said.  ""Our goal right now is to simply make it into the next round.""  ---------- bkamin@tribpub.com  Twitter @BlairKamin Caption: Photo: Chicago architect Helmut Jahn designed the University of  Chicago's Mansueto Library.

238,420416871.xml,"         In its first concrete response to the emergence of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority, Israel will delay handing over customs and tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinians pending a government decision on whether to continue the transfers, a Cabinet official said Sunday.    The transfers of about $50 million a month are a crucial source of funding for the Palestinian Authority, which is effectively bankrupt and has run out of money to pay the salaries of its employees, according to Palestinian and American officials. This month's transfer was to have been made Wednesday.    Israel has said that it will not deal with a Palestinian government led by Hamas. The militant group is set to form the next Palestinian government after a landslide victory in parliamentary elections last week, winning 74 seats in the 132-member parliament, according to final results released over the weekend.    ""There is no intention to transfer monies that will be used for terrorism,"" Israel's acting prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said at a news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We are not prepared in any way, shape or form that money which the Israeli government transfers will come under the control of murderous elements who are interested in the destruction of Israel. Therefore at this stage we are studying the situation and following developments.""    Israel collects the Palestinian customs duties and taxes at ports and border crossings and transfers them each month.    The Israeli Cabinet official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said transfers have been delayed before and that there would be no particular problem if they are again postponed. He said the government has more pressing priorities this week, and no date has been set yet for a decision on the transfers.    Palestinian predicts trouble    However the departing Palestinian economy minister, Mazen Sinokrot, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Friday that the Palestinian Authority would face a financial crunch this week if Israel withheld the funds.    Sinokrot said the 135,000 Palestinian civil servants and members of the security forces are the main breadwinners for 30 percent of Palestinian families. ""If these salaries do not come in,"" he said, ""this is a message for violence.""    James Wolfensohn, the special envoy of the so-called quartet of Middle East mediators--the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia--sounded a similar warning at Davos.    ""The Palestinians are basically bankrupt,"" he said. ""If you do not have the money to pay 135,000 Palestinians, you are going to have chaos.""    The Israeli move comes on the eve of a meeting in London on Monday of quartet representatives to discuss the outcome of the Palestinian elections. Aid to the Palestinian Authority will be a major item on the agenda after the U.S. and EU have warned that they would withhold assistance unless Hamas renounced violence and recognized Israel.    Merkel said after meeting Olmert in Jerusalem on Sunday that the EU could not support a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority if the militant group did not meet the conditions set by the donors.    ""Such a Palestinian Authority cannot be directly supported by money from the EU,"" she said. The EU has been the biggest donor to the Palestinian Authority, contributing $615 million last year. Merkel is shunning meetings with Hamas officials but will meet in Ramallah with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.    Mahmoud Zahar, the senior Hamas leader in Gaza, told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer"" on Sunday that much of the Western aid given to the Palestinian Authority had been pocketed by corrupt officials, and that Hamas would seek alternative funding from Arab and Islamic countries.    Israeli leader sets terms    Olmert on Sunday ruled out all contacts with the Palestinian Authority unless Hamas is disarmed, recognizes Israel and renounces its charter calling for Israel's destruction. Speaking at the weekly meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, he said he had secured broad agreement to that position in recent discussions with foreign leaders, including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah II, creating a united diplomatic front.    Olmert added that Israel would work with the international community to ensure that ""no dialogue is conducted with Hamas or the Palestinian Authority"" before Israel's conditions are met, including the disarming of Hamas.    Asked about the demand to recognize past agreements with the Israelis, Khaled Mashal, the top leader of Hamas, who is based in Syria, said Saturday that the group would ""honor our Palestinian commitment according to the criteria of the interests of our people.""    ""We will treat any agreement or law that is valid today realistically and according to the interests of our people,"" he added.    Zahar told CNN that Hamas would be willing to accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and a long-term truce with Israel, but he sidestepped questions about whether Hamas would recognize Israel's right to exist.    ----------    jogreenberg@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO (color): German Chancellor Angela Merkel and acting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert meet Sunday at a Jerusalem hotel.

239,2069763311.xml,"President Donald Trump shook things up every turn in his trip to Europe, making statements on NATO, Britain, Germany and more that were meant to provoke, and they did. And many of them were false.
A week in review:
Trump: ""I didn't criticize the prime minister."" — news conference Friday with British Prime Minister Theresa May.
Facts: He criticized her.
In an interview with Britain's Sun newspaper, he complained sharply about her approach to taking Britain out of the European Union and suggested she isn't living up to the will of voters who called for that step in a 2016 referendum. May is proposing to maintain certain trade and economic ties that Trump thinks should be severed.
""I would have done it much differently,"" he said in the interview. ""I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me. She wanted to go a different route. I would actually say that she probably went the opposite way. And that is fine. She should negotiate the best way she knows how. But it is too bad what is going on. ... The deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one the people voted on.""
He went to so far as to say that if Britain remains partly integrated economically with the EU, ""that would probably end a major trade relationship with the United States"" and ""kill"" chances for a bilateral U.S.-U.K. trade deal.
He also lauded Boris Johnson, May's ex-foreign minister who resigned in protest over her handling of Brexit and who may challenge her for leadership of the Conservative Party, making him prime minister.
Then he backtracked at the news conference, calling the Sun interview ""fake news"" and telling May ""whatever you do is OK with me"" and he anticipated completing a ""great bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom. This is an incredible opportunity for our two countries and we will seize it fully.""
___
Trump, speaking Friday after a NATO summit marked by his scorching rhetoric and capped by a contentious emergency meeting: ""There was a lot of love in that room.""
Facts: It does not appear Trump's NATO partners were feeling the love.
Despite attempts to tone down differences, Trump continues to leave doubts about the depth of his commitment to the alliance. ""I was prepared to do things that would have been somewhat harsh yesterday,"" Trump said Friday, touching on concerns by NATO partners that the U.S. commitment might be shaky. He also asserted that NATO ""helps Europe more than it helps us."" This, after saying at the conclusion of the summit: ""I believe in NATO.""
In Trump's telling, unity was ultimately restored by a new commitment he wrung out of NATO partners to increase their military spending to relieve pressure on the U.S. budget. ""A lot of people were surprised that NATO all came together at the end,"" he said. But European leaders said they merely agreed to keep doing what they've been doing — raising military spending under a goal set in 2014 to devote 2 percent of their gross national product to defense by 2024.
___
Trump, in Sun interview: ""I was cutting a ribbon for the opening of Turnberry — you know they totally did a whole renovation, it is beautiful — the day before the Brexit vote. I said, Brexit will happen. The vote is going to go positive, because people don't want to be faced with the horrible immigration problems that they are being faced with in other countries.""
Facts: He's mixing up his predictions and his days. A month before, he did predict accurately that Britain would vote to leave the European Union. The day after the 2016 vote — not the day before — he predicted the EU would collapse because of Britain's withdrawal. That remains to be seen. He predicted EU's collapse while at a ribbon-cutting for his Scottish golf resort in Turnberry.
___
Trump, claiming progress from his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Kim: ""We'll see where it all ends, but there have been no missile tests, there have been no research where there has been. They have blown up a site. I hear they're blowing up another missile site."" — news conference Thursday in Brussels.
Facts: North Korea has not said it blew up launch sites. Before the summit, it destroyed something else — its test site for underground nuclear blasts. Journalists witnessed the demolition of three tunnels and nearby buildings. The site may have already been compromised by the earlier, nuclear explosions and its destruction was one step among many that would be needed to achieve denuclearization.
If anything has been done to pull back on missile launch sites, it's marginal at best. Officials have not verified reports that North Korea may have demolished a stand used for missile-ejection tests in May. Ejection tests are a limited step short of a full-blown launch.
There is even some recent evidence from satellite photos that North Korea is improving its nuclear facilities.
___
Trump on NATO: ""Everyone's agreed to substantially up their commitment. They're going to up it at levels they've never thought of before."" And, ""I can tell you now that NATO now is really a fine-tuned machine. People are paying money that they've never paid before. They're happy to do it. And the United States is being treated much more fairly."" — news conference Thursday in Brussels.
Facts: There's no outward sign that Trump's aggressive posturing changed anything for the alliance other than bruise its veneer of unity.
NATO members had already agreed in 2014 to stop cutting their military budgets and set a goal of moving ""toward"" spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their own defense by 2024.
On Wednesday, Trump roiled the summit by calling on NATO members to more than double their military budgets, suggesting a new benchmark that would have them devote 4 percent of their economy to defense. (NATO lists the U.S. as spending an estimated 3.5 percent of its GDP on its military budget this year.)
But by Thursday, leaders from France, Germany and Italy offered no support for Trump's claim that he had wrung new concessions out of the alliance on their military spending. ""I made clear that we know that we have to do more and that we have been doing so for quite a while,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""That turning point has long been initiated.""
French President Emmanuel Macron said allies had reaffirmed in their communique their intention to meet the goal of 2 percent by 2024 and no more.
___
Trump, in his Sun interview: “Two per cent isn’t enough. The US pays 4.2 per cent of a much larger GDP. In fact, the GDP since I've take over has doubled and tripled, so it is a very unfair number.""
Facts: Growth in the GDP of developed nations is, if they're fortunate, measured in a few percentage points per year. Real GDP grew by 2.3% last year. To say the GDP of the United States has tripled in less than two years is a laughably false assertion, bordering on delirium.
___
Trump: ""I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the costs of NATO."" — news conference in Brussels.
Facts: Not true. The U.S. military budget compromises about 70 percent of the military spending of all NATO countries together, not 90 percent.
NATO has a largely administrative budget of about $3 billion for its headquarters and certain civilian and military costs. The U.S. share of that is capped at 22 percent. The United States may bear higher costs of certain military missions under the NATO banner.
___
Trump: ""Germany is a captive of Russia because they supply (energy). They got rid of their coal plants. They got rid of their nuclear. They're getting so much of the oil and gas from Russia. I think it's something that NATO has to look at."" — remarks Wednesday.
Facts: He's wrong about coal-fired and nuclear energy and overstated Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas. In 2017, Germany got more than one-third of its energy for electricity from coal and nearly 12 percent from nuclear plants. One-third came from renewable energy. Only 13 percent came from natural gas, with Russia as the major supplier.
Trump was objecting to Germany's acceptance of a new pipeline project that will bring more natural gas from Russia.
Germany plans to retire nuclear plants by 2022 and intends to reduce its reliance on coal. But Germany has not ""got rid"" of either.
___
Trump: ""One of the states we won, Wisconsin ... I didn't even realize this until fairly recently — that was the one state that Ronald Reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time. He didn't win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin."" — news conference Thursday in Brussels.
Facts: Trump has said this before; it's not true. Reagan won Wisconsin in the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections.

240,1980469062.xml,"Who is the leader of the free world? Important as the question sounds, I'm beginning to wonder if it's better left unanswered. The U.S. president is no longer the obvious choice. Even the new U.S. national security strategy, filled with bombastic statements such as ""the whole world is lifted by America's renewal and the re-emergence of American leadership,"" acknowledges growing competition among powers. And of course ""America first"" is the slogan of a national, not a global, leader.So who, if not Donald Trump, qualifies for the job? Let's first consider its history.The origin of the term ""leader of the free world"" is somewhat uncertain. Dominic Tierney of The Atlantic tracked it back to a 1948 New York Times article, in which British economist Barbara Ward called upon the U.S. to lead the West in fighting the communist threat. But a Google Books search suggests the title was first used during World War I and has made regular appearances in English-language books since the late 1930s. In any case, its use surged at the peak of the Cold War in the early 1960s (when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev began referring to ""the free world"" with heavy irony), declined toward the detente of the mid-1970s, then gained again through the Soviet Union's collapse and up until its last peak in 2007, just before the global financial crisis.Typically applied to the U.S. president, the title has acquired a bitterly ironic flavor since the election of Trump, who studies suggest is broadly mistrusted in democratic countries. As a result, some pundits have been discussing whether a more globally respected politician, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could take over the role. As recently as September, Hillary Clinton called her ""the most important leader in the free world right now.""Merkel, however, probably doesn't fit the bill. Weakened by the last election, she has found herself embroiled in the longest coalition talks in Germany's post-World War II history. Even if she's back on top by Easter, global leadership will be pretty far from her mind as she settles into what's likely to be her last term in power. She doesn't even have an obvious successor in her party. Besides, she has always shown much more interest in shaping the European Union to Germany's benefit than in leading the world, free or otherwise.Other European leaders don't qualify, either. Almost all lead precarious, painstakingly built coalitions with domestically focused agendas, while others -- mostly in Eastern Europe -- aren't interested in being part of any liberal order.The only notable exception is French President Emmanuel Macron, mockingly called ""Jupiter"" and compared to the Sun King by his compatriots. But, at 40 and in his first year as an elected official, he's unproven. Also, France has been in the doldrums for too long and has too many institutional and economic problems to be a credible global leader.Top EU officials could take a shot. The European project unites most established democracies, is the world's biggest trade bloc and has a consistent track record of defending liberal values. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, besides being something of a comical pair, have proved powerless even to bring the EU closer together. They're negotiators and compromise-makers, not leaders. And the EU, for all its economic power, is a peace project, so its role in resolving global conflicts will remain minimal.One could make a case for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He's a liberal favorite, branded ""the free world's best hope"" by Rolling Stone. He acts the part, emphasizing his differences with Trump on immigration, climate change and gender equality. He has also boosted Canada's military spending. But it wouldn't be easy for Canada to emerge from the shadow of the U.S., and Trudeau isn't particularly popular with Canadians (his approval rating just slipped below 50 percent).There still is a free world, in which citizens elect political leaders rather than tolerate authoritarian succession as in China or Russia. It doesn't, however, appear to have a credible leader -- one who would be both powerful and committed to clear, attractive values.Moreover, it's hard to see where one would come from. The U.S. will be eyed with mistrust after Trump. Its values are in flux and hard for outsiders to understand, and its military power is not necessarily relevant to modern conflicts, as Europe's Middle Eastern refugee crisis has demonstrated. Germany, for its part, is weighed down by its history and held together by a rebuilt communitarian tradition, in which leadership-hungry politicians are unlikely to flourish.The question, then, is whether the free world needs a leader. Perhaps the path forward requires collective decisions and compromises, inclusiveness and consensus, negotiation and civilized debate. It sounds boring, even weak, and the outcomes may often appear suboptimal, but freedom and strong leadership have always been a little at odds.Quiet, soft power as practiced by European nations, Canada and Japan might work better as an advertisement for democracy than U.S. assertiveness has since the end of the Cold War.----------BloombergLeonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.CAPTION: Photo: Poles gather in Warsaw for a July address by President  Donald Trump.

241,1020825910.xml,"      The French Socialist Party won a historic majority in parliament Sunday, providing recently elected President Francois Hollande a free hand to govern. French Socialists control all of the country's main political institutions, including both houses of parliament, the majority of France's regional councils and the political authorities in the most important French cities, giving Hollande and his government the most power the left has ever had.  The surge of support provides Hollande a green light to move forward with his election manifesto that promised to tax the rich, impose greater controls on financial institutions and balance France's economic books.  It was also seen as an endorsement of his growth-not-austerity approach to the economic crisis engulfing Europe that has put him at odds with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has insisted countries in the eurozone rein in spending.  The election also marked the return of France's far-right National Front to parliament for the first time in 24 years. Party President Marine Le Pen narrowly lost her election bid in the industrialized heartland of northern France. But her niece, 22-year-old Marion Marechal-Le Pen, won in Provence. She became the youngest lawmaker to enter parliament since 1791.  The Socialist Party and its affiliates secured 307 seats in the parliamentary election runoff, according to the final count for mainland France, comfortably more than the 289 needed for a majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.  The left-wing triumph means Hollande, elected in May, won't need to rely on the environmentalist Green Party candidates, who won 16 seats, or the Communist-dominated Left Front, with 10 deputies, to pass laws. The center-left already controls the upper house of parliament, the Senate.  ""This gives power and a backbone to the government,"" said Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici.  The mainstream conservatives, who oppose Hollande's plans to raise taxes on the rich, won 224 seats.  ",2012-06-18
242,420605514.xml,"      France's new president goes jogging in a New York Police Department T-shirt. Britain's likely new prime minister is known to vacation on Cape Cod, Mass. And Germany's chancellor once got an impromptu back rub from President Bush. Welcome to the new ""old Europe."" At the beginning of 2003, the United States had all but written off the historical power brokers of continental Western Europe. France and Germany, dead set against going to war in Iraq, were ""a problem,"" then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said. Washington's favor had tilted toward the east, where it found solid support among the European Union's newcomers. Four years later, a new set of players emerging on the old Europe bench could tip the balance back toward the Atlantic. Britain, France and Germany are fielding potentially the most pro-American group of leaders to emerge in Western Europe in years. ""In many ways, the galaxy of international leaders has never been better for the United States,"" said Erik Goldstein, head of the international relations department at Boston University. 'Changing of the guard' Nicolas Sarkozy's election as French president, Angela Merkel's earlier debut as German chancellor and Gordon Brown's expected succession as British prime minister bring into play three leaders who share a commitment to engagement with the United States and ideological orientations that more or less coincide with Washington's on issues as far-ranging as liberal economics and Israel. Four years after Americans were debating whether to change the name of french fries because of then-French President Jacques Chirac's fierce opposition to certain Washington policies, his successor spent most of his campaign being dubbed ""Sarko the American."" Brown, a brilliant and bookish student of policy long fascinated by U.S. political thought, counts among his friends Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Merkel grew up in the ""new"" Europe of East Germany with a penchant for Western blue jeans and has made repairing the connections between Washington and Berlin a starting point for her administration. ""On balance, the changing of the guard is good for the United States, and good for the Atlantic relationship,"" said Charles Kupchan, director of Europe studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The U.S. now has in Paris and in Berlin leaders that are pro-American and pragmatic. ""I don't want to suggest that we're out of the woods on the Atlantic relationship,"" he said. ""I think it's going to be very rocky. But rocky is better than where we've been, which is in the abyss."" The emergence of a new triumvirate in Europe depends first on whether leaders succeed over the next few months in negotiating a new European Union Constitution aimed at streamlining lethargic institutions and crafting a uniform voice for European policy, a goal Europeans argue benefits the U.S. as much as it does Europe. Still some unknowns Washington has no illusions that Euro-American relations will do an overnight about-face. For one thing, the departure of British Prime Minister Tony Blair means the loss of the most reliable U.S. ally on Iraq. Brown's views are not yet clear on a range of foreign policy issues that probably will determine the agenda for the foreseeable future. The treasury chief has made his mark with Britain's booming economy but has said next to nothing about how he would handle Europe's substantial energy dependence on Russia. Likewise, his policies on the Arab-Israeli conflict and tough sanctions against Iran are all largely unknown. Brown, who knows he has to distance himself from his predecessor's image as Bush's ""poodle,"" has emphasized that British ""national interest"" will be a component in the relationship with the U.S. In any case, most analysts say, no full detente with Europe is possible until Bush leaves the White House. ""He's deeply unpopular, and he's a lame duck,"" said Michael Cox, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.

243,1878730215.xml,"The clash over President Donald Trump's explosive but still-unproven claim that he was targeted for surveillance by the Obama administration will be in the spotlight Monday when FBI Director James Comey testifies before the House Intelligence Committee.  Comey has come under growing pressure from lawmakers to say publicly whether the FBI conducted wiretapping or other secret surveillance of Trump or his associates before or after the 2016 election as part of a criminal probe or a counterintelligence investigation.On Sunday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said that there was no proof in new documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department on Friday to support Trump's claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower.""Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction,"" Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""He added, ""There was no FISA warrant that I'm aware of to tap Trump Tower"" -- a reference to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a federal law that governs the issuance of search warrants in U.S. intelligence gathering.Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the panel's top Democrat, said: ""We are at the bottom of this: There is nothing at the bottom.""Schiff, speaking on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said he expected Comey to testify clearly at Monday's hearing that there is no factual basis for Trump's wiretapping claims. ""I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase, because what the president said was just patently false,"" the Democrat said. ""It's continuing to grow in terms of damage, and he needs to put an end to this.""Trump last week refused to back down from his tweets on March 4 that claimed President Barack Obama ""had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory"" and compared it to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. But no credible evidence has emerged to support those claims, and the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said last week that they have seen nothing that supports the allegation.In a statement Friday, the Justice Department said it had complied with requests from leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees and judiciary committees ""seeking information related to surveillance during the 2016 election."" The statement did not say whether the FBI had uncovered any surveillance that either targeted Trump or inadvertently captured him while targeting someone else.A spokesman for Obama described the claim as ""simply false.""On Friday, at a joint news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump appeared to joke about the dispute by reviving a diplomatic flap from Obama's tenure.""As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,"" Trump said in response to a question as he stood beside Merkel.In 2013, leaks from Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency, which conducts surveillance overseas, had eavesdropped on Merkel's cellphone as part of its efforts to spy on foreign leaders.Obama later apologized to Merkel and said he had stopped the wiretap. The two leaders ultimately repaired the rift.The House hearing Monday will be the first in Congress to publicly address the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Russian spy agencies used cyberattacks and other tactics to interfere with the U.S. presidential race.In a report released on Jan. 6, before Trump took office, the intelligence community assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the operation in an effort to hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and help Trump.The report said hackers backed by Russian intelligence had stolen and leaked thousands of emails from Democratic National Committee computer systems. Some of the emails were embarrassing to Clinton's campaign.Comey also is likely to face questioning about whether the FBI opened a formal investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials -- a question the FBI has been unwilling to answer in public.Committee leaders have said that classified and sensitive details about the FBI will be discussed in a closed session.Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will also testify Monday.Numerous Trump associates and campaign aides have had dealings with Russia, but no proof has emerged to indicate wrongdoing by the president or his associates.Regarding the wiretapping claim, GOP Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said: ""Frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, then ... President Obama is owed an apology in that regard.""----------David.cloud@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: California Reps.

244,2207009738.xml,"The similarities between Trumpism and Brexit support have been frequently noted. And indeed, it's hard for an American to spend a week in Britain, as I recently did, without feeling a certain amount of deja vu. Yet it's also hard to spend any time talking to Brexiteers without noticing one key difference: Unlike President Donald Trump's fans, Brexit supporters show no noticeable hostility to free trade.  A number of Brexiteers are actually ardent free traders who want to leave the European Union precisely because they see the EU as an obstacle to trading elsewhere. To be sure, the bulk of ""leave"" voters are more concerned with other things -- sovereignty, regulation, migration. But even among those voters, I struggled to find anyone who talked about trade the way Trump voters do. And the Britons I asked about it reassured me that I wasn't finding them because they weren't there.In fact, the only anti-trade complaints I heard all week seemed to span the political spectrum. As Britain started thinking about the sort of trade deals that might be done in a post-Brexit world, one issue united left and right, ""leave"" and ""remain"": a collective terror of chlorinated U.S. chicken. Americans unaware that some of their chicken is washed in chlorine might be baffled, but the Britons were passionate on the subject and deafeningly unanimous.But to the extent that restricting trade with the United States had any political valence at all, it was being deployed by ""remain,"" not ""leave."" That's because of the current tussle about Northern Ireland's border with the Republic of Ireland. If anyone suggested that the EU's demand for a hard border was a strategic move to make it harder for Britain to leave, rather than an actual necessity, remainers had a ready answer: Of course, the EU could not allow the United Kingdom to serve as a gateway for a U.S. invasion of the continent with brigades of chemical-soaked poultry.Opposition to trade liberalization was a major strand of Trumpism; it is somewhere between absent and reversed in polarity in Britain. Can two political movements with such different manifestations really be called part of the same phenomenon?Political scientist Eric Kaufmann argues that it can. His book ""Whiteshift,"" published in February, makes a convincing case that a single phenomenon is rolling across the West, one that has little to do with free trade, pro or anti. Instead, it is the inevitable reaction of demographic majorities to massive, immigration-induced demographic change.""When you have groups that are culturally quite distant, and a lot of them,"" he told me, ""you're going to get a response."" The trigger for this international response may have been German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision a few years ago to let about 1 million refugees into Germany, which sent a chill down the spine of immigration skeptics everywhere. But even if Merkel was the proximate cause, Kaufmann said she merely kicked an already emerging phenomenon into high gear.And thus, the political convulsions that have unsettled politics throughout the West. The United States got Trump. In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany, which in 2013 couldn't even muster the 5 percent of the vote needed to be seated in the Bundestag, is now the largest opposition party. In France, the right-wing populist party was the runner-up in the 2017 presidential election; in Italy's last parliamentary election, the populists won. Denmark and Austria checked the populist advance toward power only because the center-right co-opted the anti-immigration portion of their agenda. And Britain has Brexit.Opposition to migration may be the driving force, but it occasionally stops to pick up hitchhikers on the road to power. In the United States, protectionism managed to thumb a ride because both outsourcing and immigration were eating away at native employment in blue-collar jobs. But Britain had no established base of trade skeptics; what it had instead was a broad dislike of the EU. And because the EU was, among other things, facilitating an influx of Eastern European migration, the Brexiteers suddenly had a vehicle for their cause.That suggests that both protectionists and Brexiteers may be fooling themselves about the depth of the political support for the issues they care about. But the more troubling conclusion is that the core issue, migration, is going to continue to convulse Western politics for years to come. Populists and their opponents will experience varying degrees of success during that time, but either way, the United States and Britain and the rest of the West would at best check the growth of an already large foreign-born population. Which means they will probably not be able to check the growth of the populist movements that want them gone.----------Washington Post Writers GroupMegan McArdle is a Washington Post columnist and the author of ""The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success.""CAPTION: Photo: (A pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporter takes part in a protest outside the Houses of Parliament) KIRSTY WIGGLESWORTH/AP  <CREDIT: By Megan McArdle",2019-04-11
245,1434564026.xml,"       Her necklace made more of a statement during a televised debate  than she did, with beads the colors of the German flag. Even her  supporters admit she's no soaring orator. A giant campaign  billboard features a close-up of her hands, not her face. But the owner of that patriotic jewelry and those hands with the  fingertips pressed together looks poised to renew her claim as the  world's most powerful woman.  Germans go to the polls Sunday, and almost all indications are that  Chancellor Angela Merkel will serve a third term atop Europe's  biggest economy.  Which party she'll have to govern with in coalition remains a  tossup. But Merkel, 59, is almost certain to extend her streak as  one of the longest-serving leaders in the West.  Another term would boost her time in office to 12 years and  introduce her to her third sitting U.S. president.  Her opponents say she lacks vision, but Merkel confounds them with  her talent for making anodyne statements of little substance that  somehow succeed in soothing her compatriots, who have nicknamed her  ""Mutti"" -- ""Mommy."" (She has no children of her own.)  ""I'm not saying in a Freudian way that Germans have a mother  complex, but she does seem to put a lot of people at ease, and the  record seems to justify that trust,"" said Joerg Forbrig, an analyst  with the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin. Her  calm, unruffled air has lulled voters into complacency, critics  say, and turned this election into one of the dullest in recent  memory, even though the outcome has implications beyond Germany's  borders.  Europe's debt crisis is quiet for now, but could flare at any  moment, triggered by political instability in Italy or by Greece's  ongoing problems.  Economists urge Germany, the continent's undisputed leader, to take  bold reparative steps -- writing down more Greek debt, agreeing  with eurozone partners to issue government bonds, signing up for  radical banking reforms -- but Merkel has clung to an incremental,  at times ponderous, approach.  Yet the election has sparked little national discussion of the big  issues. Instead, voters have been distracted by such sideshows as  an image of Merkel's main rival, Peer Steinbrueck, flipping the  bird.  Merkel's party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, has  built its campaign almost entirely around her, relying on  personality rather than policy. ""At the moment, the 'mother of the  country' (image) works OK,"" said Martin Lodge, an expert on German  politics at the London School of Economics. ""But if Germany goes  downhill in the next few years, she will quickly lose support.""  Although many Germans appreciate Steinbrueck's reputation as a  straight shooter, his policy proposals -- a national minimum wage,  higher taxes on the rich -- have failed to catch fire.  Most Germans, aware of their country's disastrous experience with  charismatic leaders, have responded positively to Merkel's  risk-averse style. During her only debate with Steinbrueck, at  which her necklace spawned its own Twitter account, she somewhat  paradoxically described her government's achievements as  ""relatively sensational.""  Whether a third term would embolden her to broadcast a wider vision  for Germany and Europe is unclear. Some Germans hope it will.  ""She seems to be responding to developments rather than shaping  developments,"" Forbrig said. ""She is the most powerful woman on  Earth, and she leads one of the largest industrial countries in the  world. There's a need for German leadership.""  ---------- hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers Caption: Photo: A supporter holds a poster with the image of Chancellor Angela Merkel's hands that has symbolized her campaign.

246,420374524.xml,"         After weeks of public bickering and quiet deals over late-night dinners, Germany soon will swear in its first female chancellor.    The nation's political crisis eased Monday when conservatives and liberals agreed to form a coalition government around Angela Merkel, a physicist raised in the former communist East Germany. The deal crystallized when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced he would step aside and allow his Social Democrats to share power with Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union.    Germany has been in political disarray since Sept. 18 elections gave neither party a clear majority. Schroeder initially refused to concede, but the pressures of a troubled economy and an agitated public forced him to accept compromise. Schroeder and Merkel spent recent nights negotiating Cabinet posts and finessing an agreement their parties are expected to finalize by mid-November.    ""We have achieved something big,"" Merkel said in a news conference after a morning negotiating session that assured the CDU the chancellery.    ""We have set our aim to create a coalition that stands for new policies,"" she said. ""We want to work together for the people of this country.""    When asked how she felt about the seemingly certain prospect of becoming chancellor, a tired-looking Merkel smiled and responded: ""I'm doing well. I'm in a good mood, but I have a lot of work ahead of me.""    The presumed chancellor did not elaborate on foreign policy, but indicated she would strengthen relations with the United States, which have been strained over German opposition to the Iraq war. ""That doesn't mean we have to agree on every issue,"" Merkel said. ""But there needs to be a good trustful relationship.""    Merkel's ascension marks the final weeks of Schroeder's seven years in office. An affable leader with a fondness for crisp suits and cigars, Schroeder began reforming his nation's vast welfare state but failed to reduce high unemployment and bolster the economy. He might be remembered best for challenging President Bush on Iraq and urging Germany to move beyond the stigma of the Nazi past to become a world player.    Schroeder had no immediate statement on his future, but it appeared he would not have a role in the new government. ""I have a different plan for my life,"" he reportedly told a German newspaper.    The CDU and Social Democrat Party, or SPD, are expected to hold party conventions and endorse the agreement next month. The new parliament takes office Oct. 18, but probably won't vote on a chancellor until the party meetings are concluded. Schroeder will remain in office until Merkel is appointed.    The political deadlock in what was called the ""chancellor war"" emerged three weeks ago when Merkel, a reticent political tactician, squandered a 20-point lead in the polls to finish 1 percentage point ahead of the Social Democrats. Despite the setback, the Christian Democrats including some officials who had wanted to replace Merkel, ultimately rallied around the 51-year-old daughter of a Lutheran minister.    Schroeder sensed he would not remain in power, but his charisma and adamant tone after the election gave Social Democrats leverage in negotiating Cabinet posts. Under the agreement, Merkel was forced into major concessions, giving the SPD eight ministries, including foreign, justice and labor and social affairs. Her party will control the chancellery, six ministries and an additional Cabinet post.    The coalition is called ""grand,"" but it is expected to be fragile. The closeness of the election underscored German apprehension over social and economic reforms necessary to reduce 11.6 percent unemployment and rejuvenate Europe's largest economy. Schroeder had called for moderate reforms and trims to the welfare state. Merkel has proposed harsher measures, but Schroeder's rise in the polls before the election indicates the CDU might have to temper its plan.

247,2279236374.xml,"Plan allows drilling, grazing near Utah national monument SALT LAKE CITY -- A new U.S. government management plan unveiled Friday clears the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land that used to be off limits as part of a sprawling national monument in Utah before President Donald Trump downsized the protected area two years ago.The plan released by the Bureau of Land Management would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be ""adverse effects"" on land and resources in the monument.But while allowing more activities, the plan would also add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren't in a proposed plan issued last year.Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and canceling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas.The BLM says no land will be sold from the 1,345 square miles that were cut from what had been the 3,000 square miles of the monument.The monument has seen a 63% increase in visitors over the past decade, hosting 1.1 million people from October 2017 through September 2018, according to federal government figures.Conservation and paleontology groups have filed ongoing lawsuits to stop the downsizing.They say the new plan lacks adequate protections for the land and reiterated their concern that the years spent creating the plan were a waste of taxpayer resources because the lawsuits remain unresolved. Work on more border wall starts in Arizona, New MexicoSANTA TERESA, N.M. -- Work crews in Arizona and New Mexico are forging ahead with construction of taller border fencing being funded through a national emergency declaration by President Donald Trump.His hallmark campaign promise is taking shape along a 46-mile stretch of desert west of Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and on 2 miles of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona.At the New Mexico site Friday, about 20 workers placed rebar frames for concrete footers along the path of the wall.Environmentalists have sued over some of the construction, saying the government unlawfully waived dozens of laws to build on protected lands.They say more barriers would be detrimental to wildlife habitat and block migrations of animals such as bighorn sheep and wolves. Protesters form human chain in Hong Kong, call for democracyHONG KONG -- Supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement lined city streets and part of the city's harbor front Friday, inspired by a human chain in a historic Baltic states protest against Soviet control 30 years ago.Some raised linked hands while others switched on their smartphone lights and held the devices aloft to create a row of white lights against the nighttime skyline.It was the latest protest in a nearly 11-week-old movement that began with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill and has widened to include demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.In a protest on Aug. 23, 1989, nearly 2 million Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians formed a human chain 370 miles long. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., drops out of presidential raceWASHINGTON -- Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Harvard-educated Marine veteran who struggled to gain traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field, announced Friday that he would close his campaign, making him the third candidate to depart in the past eight days.""I am ending my campaign for president,"" Moulton said in a Friday speech in San Francisco at the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting. ""Though this campaign is not ending the way we hoped, I am leaving this race knowing that we raised issues that are vitally important.""Moulton argued that his veterans-focused campaign challenged President Donald Trump ""where he's weakest, as commander in chief,"" and worked to ""take back patriotism from"" the GOP. Court upholds ruling on fees in gay marriage caseLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Federal appeals judges have upheld a ruling that the state of Kentucky must pay $224,000 in legal expenses stemming from a former county clerk's refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses.News outlets report a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati on Friday upheld a 2017 ruling that the state must pay attorney fees and costs incurred by same-sex couples who sued.Lawyers for Gov. Matt Bevin, who supported former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis when she ran for election in 2015, argued in January that Davis should pay the fees, not the state. A Bevin spokesman said in a statement, ""We respect the court's decision.""The lower court ruling said the state should pay because it's primarily responsible for regulating marriage. Former acting FBI Director McCabe is hired by CNNWASHINGTON -- CNN announced Friday that it had hired former FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe as a contributor, drawing a swift backlash from conservatives, including President Donald Trump's eldest son and a representative of Trump's reelection campaign.McCabe, who authorized an investigation into Trump for alleged ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice, was fired in March 2018 after the Justice Department inspector general found he made an unauthorized disclosure to the media and lied to investigators about it.Earlier this month, McCabe filed a lawsuit against the FBI and the Justice Department, alleging he was illegally demoted and fired as part of a plot by Trump to remove those who were not politically loyal to him. In Russia: Paul Whelan, the 49-year-old American who was arrested here eight months ago on suspicion of being a spy, was told by a judge Friday that he will have to spend another two months in jail while prosecutors continue their pretrial investigation.He said he was the victim of a ""political kidnapping.""Whelan, an ex-Marine who holds passports from four countries, was arrested in his room at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow in late December. He had come to Russia on a tourist visa.His defense lawyers have argued that a flash drive containing ""state secrets"" was planted in his pocket. So far, no evidence against him has been presented in court.CAPTION: Photo: A portrait of G-7 leaders in Biarritz, France, on Friday, the day before the summit.

248,1869686109.xml,"Led by Vice President Mike Pence, the Trump administration is  seeking to calm tensions among anxious allies at a high-level  security summit in Germany after weeks of puzzling statements from  Washington that threatened to reorder decades of U.S. foreign  policy. The annual Munich Security Conference represents a major  opportunity for the fledgling administration to clarify U.S.  foreign policy and security priorities to heads-of-state, foreign  ministers and others worried about President Donald Trump's policy  shifts toward Europe, Russia, China and the Middle East.Although Defense Secretary James Mattis, who is here with Secretary  of Homeland Security John Kelly and several members of Congress,  gave opening remarks Friday, it will fall to Pence to allay  concerns about Trump's freewheeling style and turbulent White House  when he addresses the summit Saturday.Pence also will sit down with several European leaders, including  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who have yet to meet senior  members of a new administration that has been distracted by  infighting and leaks, including details of Trump's phone quarrels  with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.""The first theme is reassurance,"" said a senior White House foreign  policy adviser. ""We're there to reassure Europe's role both as our  indispensable partner and the commitment to our allies.""Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the United States  who now runs the Munich summit, said Pence's appearance was highly  anticipated.""We're all hoping the American vice president will give a statement  on ... all of these questions that we in the past weeks have  wondered: 'What does America under Trump really want?' ""The dismay of European leaders who have converged here is palpable,  particularly from the Baltic states. They see an increasingly  aggressive Russia on their borders, and are fearful of Trump's  oft-stated admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin two  years after his troops seized Crimea and began backing armed  separatists in eastern Ukraine.""His uncritical embrace of Putin, who most European Allies view as  a thug who poses a grave danger to European security, is deeply  disconcerting,"" said Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO  and current president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.  ""Alliances are based on trust and that trust has been severely  tested.""More than anything, European leaders are hoping for firm answers  from a White House that has challenged the network of multinational  alliances, including NATO, that has kept most of the continent at  peace since World War II.Without naming Trump, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen  criticized the president's support of Britain's decision to leave  the European Union as well as his repeated criticism of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization.""Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO  has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,"" von der  Leyen said. ""A stable European Union is also in America's interest,  as is a strong, unified, determined NATO.""Beyond that, foreign leaders are concerned about the turmoil in  Trump's national security team.Trump this week dismissed his national security adviser, Michael  Flynn, for being untruthful about his contacts with Russia's  ambassador, and has struggled to find a replacement, leaving the  National Security Council adrift nearly a month into his  presidency. High-level staffing gaps also have hampered operations  at the State Department and other federal agencies.At a rambling press conference on Thursday, Trump blamed the  growing concerns on Capitol Hill about alleged contacts between  members of his campaign and Russian authorities during last year's  presidential race for thwarting his hopes of thawing relations with  Moscow.Most of Europe now views Trump with ""considered wariness, prompting  cautious engagement,"" said Joe Devanny, a research fellow with the  International Center for Security Analysis at King's College  London.He said leaders worry that further damaging revelations will emerge  about the Trump team's contacts with Russia.----------W.J.

250,420726887.xml,"      A heavyweight  delegation of U.S. officials -- led by Vice President Joe Biden and National Security Adviser James Jones -- headed to Europe this weekend to hash out security and defense concerns with some of the nation's oldest allies. Biden was to speak Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, an annual pulse-taking among top political leaders and military experts. Speculation was rife this week about Biden's message in these gloomy economic times, but the vice president will almost certainly press for unity -- and likely seek more soldiers from European armies -- to support NATO and U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Biden's speech has been touted as the first major foreign policy speech of the weeks-old Obama administration. Serious bilateral talks are planned at the conference that began Friday; European leaders including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be consulted. But Biden -- who will be the highest-profile figure among envoys including Richard Holbrooke and Gen. David Petraeus -- will also enjoy a clear ""feel-good"" reception in the conference halls of the five-star Bayerischer Hof hotel in the center of town, analysts said. President Barack Obama's election and message of change, following eight years of Republican President George W. Bush, were generally embraced by Europeans. Quick decisions by Obama, notably the order to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, stirred further goodwill. Europeans are so happy to not have Bush ""that they're going to carry [the Americans] on their shields and strew them with garlands,"" said professor Michael Cox of The London School of Economics and Political Science, an expert on security threats and U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. ""But after the feel-good?"" he said. ""There is the long shadow of the economic crisis over all their considerations."" Challenges abound, and the notable deployment of U.S. officials to Munich underscores the stakes. Afghanistan remains a millstone for NATO. Iran's pursuit of nuclear enrichment has proved unstoppable despite international demands and sanctions. Russia, represented by Deputy Premier Sergei Ivanov, opposes a U.S.-proposed missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Ivanov reiterated that stance in a speech Friday during the opening afternoon of the conference. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is nimble on U.S. policy and interests. But analysts speculated that the administration sent Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Holbrooke, newly named envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, to rally backing for the American fight against the Taliban. ---------- cspolar@tribune.com Credit: By Christine Spolar, Tribune correspondent Caption: Photo (color): Vice President Joe Biden, who will be among a delegation of U.S. officials, was to speak Saturday in Munich.

252,1772785307.xml,"       A populist far-right German party that has fiercely attacked the  government for letting in more than a million refugees in the last  year is expected to be the big winner in three important state  elections Sunday that will serve as a referendum on Chancellor  Angela Merkel's controversial open-door policies. The party has aimed its appeal to German voters with a strong  anti-foreigner bent that has some similarities to Donald Trump's  bid to win the Republican nomination for U.S. president.  The Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has campaigned hard  against refugees streaming into the country, and it has surged in  public opinion polls from about 3 percent last summer to as high as  20 percent ahead of elections in three of Germany's 16 states. That  is far above the 4.7 percent the AfD won in the 2013 federal  election just half a year after it was formed mainly to oppose  Europe's single currency, the euro, and the expensive European  Union financial bailouts to Greece.  Political leaders across the board say there is zero chance of the  AfD taking power in the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg,  Rhineland-Palatinate or Saxony-Anhalt because the other four  mainstream parties running in those states have vowed to reject any  kind of a coalition with it. Still, the AfD's projected electoral  triumphs have upset the political establishment in Germany.  The party's success could give Merkel a black eye in the most  important German elections this year ahead of the 2017 federal  election. It may also make it harder for the other parties to pull  together 50 percent of the seats in the state assemblies to form  working coalitions after the bellwether vote.  ""These state elections and the increasing strength of the AfD could  cause a considerable amount of uncertainty for Merkel,"" said  Thorsten Hasche, a political scientist at the University of  Goettingen. ""It's usually only state issues that decide these  elections, but this time it's all been turned into a referendum on  Merkel's refugee policies.""  Hasche said the AfD, which is polling between 10 percent in the  rural western state of Rhineland-Palatinate and 20 percent in the  impoverished eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, has succeeded in  tapping support from frustrated voters with low incomes and  educations the same way that Trump has attracted many such voters  in the U.S.  ""Trump has won over voters who are disappointed with the  establishment, and the AfD has won over voters disappointed with  mainstream parties,"" he said.  A number of small postwar far-right parties have emerged in  Germany, but, because of its Nazi past, they by and large have been  repudiated after surges in support to as high as 10 percent. None  have held seats in any state or federal government, and support for  most all but collapsed within a few years.

253,420387929.xml,"         Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday dismissed the Holocaust as a myth and renewed his call for the transfer of Israel from the Middle East to Europe or North America.    ""They have created a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets,"" Ahmadinejad declared in a speech in Sistan-Baluchistan province that was broadcast on state television. He said the Palestinian people should not suffer if Europeans committed a crime against the Jewish people.    ""Why do you want to enforce Israel on the Holy Land of Palestine by killing Muslims,"" he asked. ""Give a piece of your land in Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska so the Jews can create their own state.""    Since his election in June, the hard-line president has made a series of shocking statements about Israel, calling in October for the Jewish state to be ""wiped off the map."" Last week, he stirred controversy by raising doubts about the Holocaust, stating that ""some European countries insist on saying that during World War II, Hitler burned millions of Jews.""    Ahmadinejad's latest comments drew swift criticism Wednesday in Jerusalem, Washington and Europe, where Britain, Germany and France have taken the lead in pursuing negotiations to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.    In Israel, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mark Regev accused Ahmadinejad of acting outside international law and legitimacy. ""The repeated outrageous remarks by the Iranian president unfortunately indicate the real mind set of the ruling clique,"" Regev said.    'Incomprehensible'    German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the remarks were ""incomprehensible"" and called for the European Union to issue a formal condemnation. In Germany, it is a crime to deny the Holocaust.    White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan said of the Iranian leader: ""His comments and statements only underscore why it is so important that the international community continue to work together to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.""    Ahmadinejad, a former Tehran mayor, swept the June presidential election in a landslide, with the help of populist slogans and support by religious fundamentalists as well as a broad cross- section of the economically disadvantaged.    Even before he took office, Ahmadinejad repeated Iran's determination to develop what it calls a peaceful nuclear program but what the West fears could lead to the development of nuclear weapons. He repeated that insistence Wednesday.    ""Those who have made and are still manufacturing nuclear and chemical weapons and use them against humanity have no right to deprive Iran,"" he said.    Several analysts said Wednesday that Ahmadinejad's comments on the Holocaust seemed aimed at shoring up support among his followers at home and staking out a claim of leadership in the region as a voice against Israel.    ""Ahmadinejad has no support among the educated in Iran, and through his extremism tries to establish himself as a champion and revolutionary symbol for the base of support that he has,"" said Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University. ""But he does that at a cost to our national interest.""    Glen Rangwala of the Center of International Studies at the University of Cambridge said the speech appeared to be Ahmadinejad's effort to ""outbid his rivals for political prominence, not just within Iran but within the whole Muslim Middle East.""    ""Earlier this year, you had both Bahrain and Qatar making closer ties to Israel, as part of what their governments are trying to do in the near future,"" Rangwala added. ""What Ahmadinejad is doing is essentially appealing over the heads of these leaders to their populations, saying that he now is the true leader of the anti- Israeli campaign in the gulf area.""    Remarks called a distraction    Mostafa Tajzadeh, a reformist politician, said Ahmadinejad made such extremist comments to draw attention to the international arena and distract Iranians from domestic problems.    ""By making such inflammatory remarks he is able to distract people from the fact that they are choking from pollution in Tehran and that the economy is at a standstill,"" Tajzadeh added.    However, one of Ahmadinejad's former colleagues on the Tehran City Council said the Iranian leader truly believes what he said, as do many in the Muslim world.    ""This is a scenario created by the West to justify their strategic interests to take part of Palestine,"" Amir Reza Vaezi- Ashtiani said of Israel's existence. ""If it wasn't true, the West wouldn't hurt so bad and react so strongly.""

254,2065748960.xml,"The day the White House announced plans for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump publicly doubted whether Moscow had interfered with the campaign that landed him in the White House.  ""Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!"" Trump tweeted, contradicting the persistent conclusions of his own country's intelligence agencies.Such statements have stirred controversy here for the last two years. Now they're also rattling U.S. allies in Europe, where Moscow has deployed some of the same disinformation tactics that it used to manipulate the 2016 U.S. campaign.As Trump prepares to meet with Putin on July 16 in Helsinki, Finland, there's little sign that he's willing to take a hard line against election interference.""We're going to be talking about elections,"" Trump told reporters recently. ""We don't want anybody tampering with elections.""However, he didn't blame Russia for any of its actions.U.S. and foreign experts and government officials point to a series of incidents across Europe that show Moscow's ambition to spread political chaos on the continent.Hackers released a trove of emails from Emmanuel Macron's campaign last year while Russia was backing the right-wing candidate, Marine Le Pen.Latvia has seen a wave of disinformation that officials fear may increase in the months leading up to parliamentary elections this fall.Sweden is strengthening efforts to counter fake news spread through social media in hopes of deterring Russian interference in its government.""The Russians have discovered it works very well. It's cheap. It's effective,"" said a European diplomat who requested anonymity to candidly discuss international relations.Trump will likely get an earful about the problem shortly before he meets with Putin, when he attends the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's summit in Belgium.He's shown little affection, however, for the alliance, which was created in the wake of World War II as a bulwark against Russian influence.A harbinger came during a NATO meeting last year, when Trump became the first U.S. president in decades not to reiterate U.S. support for Article 5, the provision that requires each NATO member to defend all others against attacks. Once his failure to support the treaty provision became a point of public controversy, Trump eventually endorsed it.Trump has also undermined German Chancellor Angela Merkel, criticizing her leadership as she faces political challenges at home.""It's no longer clear who's the fox and who are the chickens,"" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.The goals of Russia's election interference efforts have often seemed to align with Trump's own goals.Russia wants to undermine a united Europe, represented by the European Union and NATO, and thereby expand its own power, according to the majority view of U.S. government and private analysts.""For Russia, a disunited Europe is better than a united Europe,"" said Angela Stent, who directs the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University.Trump has expressed interest in dealing with European countries on an individual basis in an effort to seek better trade deals, undercutting long-standing international organizations. He also cheered on the Brexit movement splitting the United Kingdom from the European Union -- a campaign that has been accompanied by its own allegations of Russian interference.Trump has been sensitive to questions about Moscow's meddling, believing they're used to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency.He tweeted last week that he doubted law enforcement had adequately investigated the issue. ""So many questions, so much corruption!""U.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that Russia released hacked emails and spread disinformation on social media to boost Trump's candidacy. Whether anyone from Trump's campaign or his circle of associates participated in that effort remains under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.""Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,"" said a declassified report from the intelligence agencies that was released before Trump was inaugurated.""We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" the report said.The conclusion was backed up last week by a bipartisan report from the Senate intelligence committee that said not only that Putin had directly ordered the interference, but that Russia sought to boost Trump's candidacy.Similar tactics have been used in Europe, notably in countries along Russia's western border that used to be part of the Soviet Union before it was dissolved in 1991.""Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are clearly on the front line of the Kremlin's malign influence operations and have suffered from some of the most egregious cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns yet seen in Russia's near abroad,"" said a January report from Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.When Canadian troops were stationed in Latvia last year, fake articles on Russian websites accused them of living large in luxury apartments, littering and spending their time buying beer.Latvia is particularly vulnerable to Moscow's propaganda because roughly one quarter of the population speaks Russian. The country's experience has led to new efforts to counter fake news by teaching students to sort through propaganda.Russia appeared to take even bolder steps last year before France's elections.The right-wing National Front party received 9 million euros in loans from the First Czech Russian Bank at a time when it was struggling to find financing from French institutions.""They didn't even cover their tracks. It's the Prague branch of a Russian bank,"" said Charles Lichfield, a London-based analyst at the Eurasia Group, an international consulting organization.Much like Clinton's campaign in the U.S., Macron's team saw its emails hacked and released on the internet. Some security consultants have pinned the blame on groups with links to Russian intelligence.Macron still defeated the National Front's Le Pen in a landslide.----------chris.megerian@latimes.comCAPTION: Photo: Few expect President Donald Trump to take a hard line  against election interference in his meeting with Vladimir Putin.

255,420420332.xml,"         Chancellor Angela Merkel's government strengthened its grip on German politics Sunday, with partial results showing the two parties in the ruling coalition likely to win three state elections.    In the first electoral test since she took office in November, Merkel's Christian Democrats won in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony- Anhalt states, preliminary results showed, while the Social Democrats were dominant in Rhineland-Palatinate.    The outcome will likely see the main opposition party, the pro- business Free Democrats, pushed out of one or two of the three state parliaments.    That would strengthen the majority that Merkel's coalition holds in the upper house of parliament, where Germany's 16 states are represented.    Merkel's consensual approach and a flurry of well-received foreign trips have sent her approval ratings soaring.  ",2006-03-27

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa took a commanding lead early Monday in Poland's first direct presidential election, but not by a margin wide enough to avoid a runoff.


Early unofficial returns and an exit poll conducted by a German research firm showed Walesa outdistancing his nearest rivals 2-1 but falling well short of the majority needed to avert a runoff.


Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and political outsider Stanislaw Tyminski were locked in a race for second place to determine who would meet Walesa in the Dec. 9 runoff.


Polish television broadcast an exit poll, conducted by the respected Bonn-based research firm INFAS, which predicted Mazowiecki and Tyminski would finish in a virtual tie for second place, each with 20.5 percent of the vote.


INFAS, which conducted exit polls with great accuracy in Romania and Czechoslovakia earlier this year, estimated Walesa would win 41 percent of the vote, with the remaining 18 percent split among three minor candidates.


Unofficial returns compiled by state television and the government seemed to confirm the INFAS trend. At midnight, four hours after the polls closed, state television said results from 395 of Poland's 22,241 precincts showed Walesa leading with 39.3 percent of the vote, followed by Tyminski with 23.2 percent and Mazowiecki with 19.9 percent.


The government's statistical bureau estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the 27.5 million eligible voters cast ballots. Final results were expected late Monday or Tuesday.


It appeared that the second runoff position could be determined by the Poles who cast absentee ballots in Chicago and scores of other cities around the world over the weekend.


Polish election officials estimate that hundreds of thousands of expatriates were eligible to vote in the U.S., Europe, Canada, China, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and aboard merchant marine vessels. Their votes were being relayed to Warsaw by telephone and telex.


An official of the Polish Consulate in Chicago said Walesa won about 60 percent of the vote among Poles in North America who cast ballots, while Mazowiecki received about 33 percent and Tyminski got 3 percent.


The showing for Walesa was even stronger in Chicago, where he got 76 percent of the vote, according to Wojciech Jarominski of the Polish Consulate. The total number of votes cast Saturday at the three locations in Chicago was 9,810, well below pre-election predictions.


Ald. Roman Pucinski, who was at the Polish American Congress when the votes were tallied, said many of Chicago's Poles will be disappointed by election rules that permit them to take part in the initial balloting but not in a runoff.


Poland allows naturalized U.S. citizens who hold Polish passports to vote, as well as newly arrived immigrants and visitors.


The election was Poland's first direct presidential vote in history. Previous presidents were chosen by parliament.


Before Sunday's vote, Walesa said he might refuse to participate in a runoff if he failed to win a majority in the first round. He said such a result would prove he lacked support for his calls to speed up reform in Poland.


The Solidarity leader also said he would be so embarrassed he would consider leaving the country if Tyminski won the right to meet him in a runoff.


But at a postmidnight news conference in Walesa's hometown of Gdansk, his campaign manager, Jacek Merkel, said Walesa would take part in the second round of voting.


Walesa refused to make any statement. But Merkel said Walesa believes those who cast ballots for Tyminski were ""voting for dreams.""


Tyminski, a self-made millionaire who has lived abroad for the last 21 years, wooed voters by promising to use his business instincts to turn around Poland's battered economy.


In a brief appearance on national television, Tyminski boasted he was in the runoff and called for Walesa to debate him before the second round of voting.


However, Mazowiecki, who just 459 days ago became Poland's first non-Communist prime minister in four decades, refused to concede the election.


""Let's wait for the real results,"" he said after sipping champagne with supporters at his campaign headquarters in Warsaw. ""No matter what the results, we gave a new start to democracy in Poland.


""But if you want to know my first reaction, I will tell you that the first results give a picture of the crisis that Poland is undergoing. It is a result of the destructive attitudes of the past few months and the past few weeks.""


Mazowiecki's mention of recent ""destructive attitudes"" was a reference to the bitterness of the campaign.


Tyminski was the focus of much of that bitterness. He caused a national uproar eight days before the election when he accused Mazowiecki of ""betraying the people"" by trying to sell state assets at grossly undervalued prices.


Government prosecutors threatened to bring slander charges against Tyminski for his statement, which apparently was incorrect. He cited the wrong figures from government documents when he made his allegations.


Tyminski, 42, was virtually unknown when the campaign began four weeks ago. But he built a large enough following to tip the balance of power in the election by appealing to voters disenchanted at having to choose between Walesa and Mazowiecki-the two heroes who together led Solidarity's fight to topple communism.


""Tyminski is my man because he is the only real alternative,"" said Andrew Steven, 29, a Warsaw native who emigrated to Australia several years ago and returned after Solidarity came to power.


""Solidarity hasn't done anything. It is time for a change.""


Tyminski, who owns a computer company in Canada and a cable TV franchise in Peru, also appealed to voters looking for quick solutions to the economic hardships caused by a crash reform program introduced by the Mazowiecki government.


That reform program is succeeding, but at a painful cost. Inflation has been reined in, the zloty is on the way to becoming fully convertible and shops are filled with goods for the first time in more than a generation. But real incomes have dropped nearly 40 percent and more than 1 million people are out of work.


The winner of the presidential race will replace Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist general who declared martial law in Poland in 1981 and ordered the arrests of thousands of anti-Communist activists, including Walesa and Mazowiecki.


Jaruzelski was elected to a six-year term in July 1989 with the support of his former enemies in Solidarity as part of a behind-the-scenes deal that gave Poland its first non-Communist government in 42 years.


In September, amid growing pressure from Walesa, Jaruzelski asked parliament to cut short his term and call elections.


Under the current constitution, the next president will serve a five-year term as head of state and commander-in-chief of the military. He will have power to appoint a prime minister, dissolve parliament and, in strictly defined circumstances, declare a state of emergency.


However, the president's powers will be redefined under a new constitution to be written before May 3, 1991, the 200th anniversary of Poland's democratic constitution.


""From a legal standpoint this presidential election is upside down,"" said Jerzy Baczynski, deputy editor of the respected left-wing weekly newspaper Polityka. ""We are picking a president before we define a presidential role.""


The president will be able to exert strong influence on the shape of the new constitution. Walesa's aides say he would promote a powerful presidential system of government similar to that of the U.S.

The center-left Hollande narrowly beat the conservative Sarkozy 28.6 percent to 27.1 percent, the Interior Ministry said, with 99 percent of votes counted, but Marine Le Pen stole the show by capturing 18 percent, the biggest result for a far-right candidate.  The results were a blow for Sarkozy, who opinion polls show is the most unpopular French president to run for re-election. It was the first time a sitting president had failed to win a first-round vote in the past 50 years. He faces an uphill struggle to capture Le Pen's supporters and defeat Hollande.  ""The battle of France has only just begun,"" Le Pen, 43, daughter of former paratrooper and National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, told cheering supporters. Declaring that her wave of support is ""shaking the system"" of mainstream consensus politics, she said: ""We are now the only real opposition.""  Sarkozy struck a defiant tone after his setback, steering to the right to try to attract Le Pen voters by vowing to tighten border controls and stop factories from leaving France. He challenged Hollande to three live television debates during the next two weeks instead of the customary one.  Recent opinion polls have shown a double-digit lead for Hollande in a runoff with Sarkozy.  A victory would make the 57-year-old Hollande, sometimes criticized for being bland, only the second Socialist leader in France's history. He supports controlling financial speculation, regulating banks, and taxing the rich and large, profitable companies.  Hollande has pledged to renegotiate the deal Sarkozy struck with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to rein in budget deficits in European Union countries. He supports encouraging growth over austerity programs and proposes a 75 percent tax rate on personal earnings of more than $1.3 million a year.  Sarkozy, 57, of the Union for a Popular Movement party, has never shaken the image that, as a conservative leader, he is the ""president of the rich.""  Sarkozy had said he would turn France away from its traditional partnership with Germany and remold the country along more Anglo-Saxon free-market lines. His France would be more dynamic and competitive. But the economic crisis resulted in rampant unemployment, a damaging public spending deficit and the loss of France's triple-A credit rating.  The government came up with two austerity plans in quick succession: The first amounted to about $15.2 billion in tax increases and spending cuts, the second to about $26 billion, including reductions in health services and a higher retirement age. Supporters say Sarkozy has shown strength in the face of economic turmoil. Credit: By Kim Willsher, Special to Tribune Newspapers Reuters contributed.

258,1979894391.xml,"Every December, I ask readers to help me predict the news events of the coming year, and 12 months later I come back for a look at how their predictions and mine matched up against actual events.  I'll spare you the suspense. After my narrow victory in 2016, the plurality predictions of the hive mind killed me in 2017, with a 62 percent accuracy rate against my 44 percent.On only 10 predictions out of 34 -- most of them fairly easy -- readers and I were correct. We said that ...* Democratic Rep. Michael Madigan would be re-elected as Illinois House speaker.* Democrats would not select U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota to be their national chairman (they chose Tom Perez).* President Donald Trump's job approval number in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll in mid-December 2017 would be under 40 percent (it's hovering around 35 percent).* Congress would not approve substantial funding for a new wall at the Mexican border.* The Trump Justice Department would not launch a ""lock her up!"" effort to prosecute Hillary Clinton.* The U.S. gross domestic product would grow at a rate of from 2 to 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2017 (the reported estimate was 3.3 percent, compared to 3.5 for the third quarter of President Barack Obama's last full year in office).* President Trump would not block commercial flights from the U.S. to Cuba.* The U.S. would not withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal (though Trump is strongly signaling that we will soon).* The White Sox would not make the postseason.* The Blackhawks would not win the Stanley Cup.Eleven times, readers were right and I was wrong. I foolishly disagreed when they said that ...* Someone other than Jay Cutler and Matt Barkley (remember him?) would start the season as quarterback for the Bears. (It was Mike Glennon, remember him?)* President Trump would move to block federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities.* Trump would bail out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP).* There would be more than 500 homicides in Chicago (we are already over 650 but thankfully not on pace to exceed the 2016 total of 792)* Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel would not fire police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.* The U.S. Senate would confirm President Trump's first pick for the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.* Right-wing firebrand Marine Le Pen would lose the French presidential election.* Incumbent German Chancellor Angela Merkel would win re-election.* The Cubs would not repeat as World Series champions.* Trevor Noah would still be the host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central.* Fred Hoiberg would still be the coach of the Bulls.In only five instances was I right and readers wrong. They disagreed with my guesses that ...* Republicans would fail in their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).* One of Trump's Cabinet nominees would fail to be seated (Labor secretary candidate Andrew Pudzer withdrew).* Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett would get a prison sentence of from four to seven years (she got 4 1/2; readers thought it would be seven to nine years).* U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock of Peoria, charged for misuse of funds, would still be awaiting trial.* The U.S. would not suffer a terrorist attack in 2017 worse than the June 12, 2016, attack on an Orlando nightclub in which 49 people were killed.The last one is debatable. I didn't count the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 dead as a terrorist act, because the gunman's motive remains unclear and seems unrelated to foreign or domestic terror efforts.And eight times, readers and I were both wrong when we predicted that ...* The Dow Jones Industrial Average would be lower than 22,500 (it's well over 24,000 at this writing).* The state budget stalemate would not end.* The unemployment rate would rise to 4.7 percent or higher by November 2017 (it was 4.1 percent).* 2017 would be another global warmest-year-on-record. Experts say it will fall just short of the 2016 record.* J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy would not both run for governor.* The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide would be higher than $2.75 (it's roughly $2.42).* Alabama would win the college football crown (it was Clemson).* Bears coach John Fox would be fired.Technically, our record will improve slightly if Fox is given his inevitable walking papers before Jan. 1, but due to deadlines, these predictions have always been based on a year ending just before Christmas.Given this record of futility, the question comes up: Why do this? Why try to look ahead through the fog when a monkey with a dart board could do just as well?Because making and later reviewing predictions is simply another way of planting a flag in the present -- of taking note of the puzzles that now concern us and looking back with humility at how life has confounded us.Now, for instance, many of us are wondering if the Democrats will retake one or both chambers of Congress in the November elections, if the soaring stock market will come back to earth in 2018 and who else will be indicted in the probe of Russian interference into the 2016 election.We're wondering if Congress will protect the ""Dreamers,"" if the U.S. will take military action against North Korea and if the U.S. Supreme Court will allow bakers to refuse to sell wedding cakes to gay couples.We're wondering where President Trump's job-approval number will be in 12 months, or if he will even still be in office.We're wondering who's going to win the gubernatorial election in Illinois and if Republicans can flip the state House and seize the speaker's gavel from Michael Madigan.We're wondering who's going to throw a hat in the ring to challenge Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the February 2019 election.I have my hunches on these and other questions, and you probably do too.

259,1642143041.xml,"       The ongoing slump in the price of oil is starting to become a headache for the stock market. On Monday, oil plunged, dipping below $50 per barrel for the first time in more than five years. The sharp drop prompted a big sell-off, not just in the energy sector, but across the entire stock market.    Stocks had already endured a weak open amid concerns that Greece could exit the euro, adding to worries about the poor outlook for growth in that region. As oil continued to slide, the losses deepened and the Standard & Poor's 500 index ended the day with its biggest loss in three months.    The price of oil has been falling since last summer amid mounting evidence that the world is oversupplied with the commodity after a surge in U.S. production. After six months of falling prices, investors are now getting jittery that the slump is attributable to more than just the supply glut; it could also be signaling a weakening global economy.    ""The lower that oil prices go, the more it reinforces into the market's mind that perhaps this is more of a demand issue than a supply issue,"" said Burt White, Chief Investment Officer at LPL Financial. That raises questions ""about the robustness of this recovery.""    The S&P 500 index dropped 37.62 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,020.58. That was the biggest one-day slump for the index since Oct. 9. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 331.34 points, or 1.9 percent, to 17,501.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 74.24 points, or 1.6 percent.    Energy stocks led the drop, plunging 4 percent, as the price of oil closed down $2.65 at $50.04 a barrel, after dipping below $50 during trading. But the declines were broad, and even airline stocks, usually a beneficiary of lower oil prices, ended the day lower.    Most analysts and economists say that, on balance, a decline in oil prices is a boon for the broader economy because it reduces energy costs for industrial companies. Lower gas prices also put more money in the pockets of consumers.    But there are downsides as well.    As the price of oil slumps, some companies in the energy industry will go out of business. Not only will that cost jobs in the sector, but it will also cut spending on things like plants and equipment.    Transocean, a company that provides offshore drilling services to oil companies, was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 index on Monday. The company's stock slumped $1.28, or 7.1 percent, to $16.84.    Another area for concern is Europe.    Investors were already worried about the poor growth prospects in the euro region, and the impact that it would have on global growth. Now, they also have to contend with renewed speculation that Greece may exit the euro.    European stock markets slumped and the euro plunged against the dollar on reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel no longer believes it would be too risky for the 19-member eurozone if Greece dropped out of the currency bloc. Elections in Greece this month could be won by the Syriza party, which wants to renegotiate the terms of the country's international bailout, threatening its place in the euro group.    The outlook for economic growth in Europe and other regions matters to companies in the U.S., as nearly half the sales from S&P 500 companies are generated outside the U.S.    Just one week ago, the S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high of 2,090.57. The energy sector aside, company earnings should remain strong, and the economy is still growing. Last quarter the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 5 percent.

260,1862557104.xml,"President Donald Trump made a flurry of phone calls to world  leaders Saturday as he began shaping his new administration's  foreign policy, but none was as anxiously anticipated as the first  official president-to-president contact with Russia's Vladimir  Putin.Trump sat in the Oval Office and spoke with the Russian president  on his desk phone, at one point peering out of the windows at the  White House journalists watching from across the Rose Garden. The pair discussed combating terrorism, confronting Islamic State  militants, the crisis in Ukraine and the Iranian nuclear deal,  according to a statement from the Kremlin. Moscow said the topic of easing U.S. sanctions against Russia over  its 2014 annexation of Crimea did not come up. And the two agreed to a set a possible date and venue for a  personal meeting and vowed to maintain ""regular personal contacts,""  the Kremlin statement said. In its own statement after the one-hour call, the White House said,  ""The positive call was a significant start to improving the  relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need  of repair. Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful  that after today's call the two sides can move quickly to tackle  terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern."" Trump's budding relationship with Putin is certain to be one of the  most closely watched of his administration, both at home and around  the world. Trump has alarmed European leaders and U.S. lawmakers from both  parties with his praise and unusually friendly overtures toward the  Russian leader, whom much of the world considers an authoritarian  who has taken increasingly aggressive actions in Europe and the  Middle East. And Trump's oft-stated desire to improve relations with Russia  comes despite the recent conclusion by American intelligence  agencies that Russia hacked into the email systems of U.S.  political organizations last year in an audacious bid to interfere  with the presidential election and help Trump. Trump said Friday that having Russia as an ally ""would be an  asset."" He said Russia can help the U.S. defeat Islamic State  militants in Syria, even though Putin's priority so far in Syria  has not been attacking Islamic State but supporting his ally,  Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is opposed by the U.S. Trump's pick for secretary of state, America's top diplomat, has  further cemented the concerns. Rex Tillerson, the former chief  executive officer of Exxon Mobil, has acknowledged a close  relationship with Putin, honed through years of multibillion-dollar  deals for oil exploration and drilling in Russia. Both Trump and Tillerson have been less than enthusiastic about  economic sanctions imposed on Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine  and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Trump even suggested the  U.S. could lift the sanctions if Russia agreed to compromise on  nuclear arms, an unrelated matter. Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator and former chairman of the  parliamentary foreign relations committee, said Saturday that the  phone call marked the start of a new, closer U.S.-Russia  relationship. ""The Trump-Putin conversation will give a new beginning to the  fight against IS, a solution of the crises in Syria, Ukraine.  (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel only has old solutions,"" he  tweeted. Trump supporters said that his outreach toward Russia was intended  to curb Putin's aggressive behavior. ""I do think they are going into this with a general negotiating  tactic: Offer Russia a chance to back off and not be antagonistic,""  said James Jay Carafano, a senior fellow at the conservative think  tank Heritage Foundation, who briefed Trump on foreign affairs  during the transition. ""That is different from placating (Putin)  and giving him whatever he wants."" In addition to the chat with Putin, Trump made phone calls Saturday  to four other world leaders: Merkel, French President Francois  Hollande, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime  Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump and Abe agreed to meet Feb. 10 in Washington and affirmed the  importance of their alliance, Abe said, after the U.S. strained  relations by withdrawing from a Pacific trade pact. ----------christi.parsons@latimes.comCredit: By Christi Parsons and Tracy Wilkinson, Washington Bureau; Special correspondent Mansur Mirovalev in Moscow and Bloomberg News contributed.Caption: Photo: Donald Trump chatted with five world leaders, including  Vladimir Putin, on Saturday.

261,2551497818.xml,"Overdose deaths soared to a record 93,000 last year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government reported Wednesday. That estimate far eclipses the high of about 72,000 drug overdose deaths reached the previous year and amounts to a 29% increase.""This is a staggering loss of human life,"" said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University public health researcher who tracks overdose trends.The nation was already struggling with its worst overdose epidemic but clearly ""COVID has greatly exacerbated the crisis,"" he added.Lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get, experts said.While prescription painkillers once drove the nation's overdose epidemic, they were supplanted first by heroin and then by fentanyl, a dangerously powerful opioid, in recent years. Fentanyl was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasing been sold illicitly and mixed with other drugs.""What's really driving the surge in overdoses is this increasingly poisoned drug supply,"" said Shannon Monnat, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University who researches geographic patterns in overdoses. ""Nearly all of this increase is fentanyl contamination in some way. Heroin is contaminated. Cocaine is contaminated. Methamphetamine is contaminated.""Fentanyl was involved in more than 60% of the overdose deaths last year, CDC data suggests.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed death certificates to come up with the estimate for 2020 drug overdose deaths. The estimate of over 93,000 translates to an average of more than 250 deaths each day, or roughly 11 every hour.Merkel visit to US: In a meeting intended to reflect the importance of U.S.-German ties, Kamala Harris will hold talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel at the vice president's residence Thursday, the first time she has hosted a foreign leader at the Naval Observatory since taking office.At their breakfast meeting, Harris intends to emphasize the need for the allies to confront an array of global challenges, from the coronavirus pandemic and climate change to the threats posed by Russia and China.""It underscores the special nature of this partnership and America's special role in the world that she is able to host her at her home,"" said Phil Gordon, the vice president's deputy national security advisor.Harris and Merkel also will discuss the need to promote and defend democracy at home, ""acknowledging, frankly, that we face challenges in our own countries and we need to talk about that,"" Gordon said.Also expected to come up is the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as the role of NATO and Germany in maintaining stability in Afghanistan in the aftermath.Merkel will visit the White House later Thursday to meet with President Joe Biden. That session is expected to cover many of the same issues, in addition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which his administration opposes.Marijuana proposal: The Senate's top Democrat is backing a bill that would strike down a longstanding federal prohibition on marijuana, embracing a proposal that has slim chance of becoming law yet demonstrates growing public support for decriminalizing the drug.Proposals to legalize marijuana are nothing new.But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a sponsor of the effort unveiled Wednesday, underscoring how a once-fringe idea is increasingly mainstream.The measure would erode a central pillar of the decades-long war on drugs, which has disproportionately affected communities of color in the United States.""I will use my clout as majority leader to make this a priority in the Senate,"" said Schumer, of New York, who is the first Senate leader to support such an effort. ""It's not just an idea whose time has come, it's long overdue.""The bill would treat marijuana much like alcohol or tobacco, allowing it to be taxed and regulated. States could still outlaw its use. And those under the age of 21 couldn't purchase it. It would remain illegal to sell significant quantities without proper licensing and authorization, much like bootlegging alcohol. It would also clear the path for additional cannabis medical research.2022 fundraising: The committee charged with helping Republicans wrest control of the House in 2022 raised $45.4 million over the last three months, a record quarterly haul during a year without a national election.That total was bolstered by $20.1 million raised in June, the highest ever monthly off-year total, according to numbers shared with The Associated Press before a public filing deadline.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last week announced that it had raised $14.4 million in June, bringing its second-quarter total to about $36.5 million -- its best ever for that stretch.Hiccups in Brazil: After 10 consecutive days of hiccups, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was admitted to a hospital Wednesday with what doctors said was an intestinal obstruction that could require emergency surgery.Bolsonaro, 66, was admitted to the Armed Forces Hospital in the capital of Brasilia early in the morning and was ""feeling well,"" according to an initial statement that said doctors were examining his persistent hiccups.But hours later, the president's office said the surgeon who operated on Bolsonaro after he was stabbed in the abdomen during the 2018 presidential campaign decided to transfer him to Sao Paulo, where he will undergo additional tests to evaluate the need for an emergency surgery.Chronic hiccups are usually the manifestation of an underlying problem, such as an obstructed intestine, that might require surgery, said Dr. Anthony Lembo, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In some cases, part of the intestine might need to be removed, he said.Pope out of hospital: Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.Francis, 84, stopped at St. Mary Major Basilica to give thanks for the success of the operation and pray for others before returning home, the Vatican said. The pope always visits the basilica after a foreign trip to pray at a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary.CAPTION: Photo: Bastille Day: France celebrated its national holiday  Wednesday with thousands of troops marching in Paris, warplanes overhead and parties around the country, after last year's events were scaled back because of virus fears.

262,1011075751.xml,"      For more than two years now, they have all imposed their will on  Europe's raging debt crisis: German leaders. Panicked governments.  Jittery financial markets. Bossy international agencies. The people? Not so much.   Across the continent, officials have forced through brutal budget  cuts despite mass protests from Paris to Prague. In Greece and  Italy, technocratic prime ministers have been installed without a  single citizen going to the polls. Of the 25 European nations that  have agreed to a new treaty limiting public spending, only Ireland  is bothering to let voters rule on it.   But Sunday, the people of France and Greece will have their say, in  elections that have the potential to recast the debate over how to  solve an economic unraveling that shows little signs of abating.   ""Democracy is on its way into the euro crisis,"" said Hugo Brady of  the Brussels office of the London-based Center for European Reform.  ""While we don't know what that means, it does mean the end of a  solely technocratic response to it.""   Sunday's elections are likely to see new leaders brought to power  on pledges to revisit their countries' strict adherence to the  austerity and fiscal discipline prescribed by Germany as the cure  for Europe's ills. That the challenges come from these two  countries is significant: France has been Germany's most important  ally, while Greece sits at the epicenter of Europe's debt problems.   But changes to the current game plan also could unsettle investors  allergic to the slightest whiff of uncertainty.   When they open Monday, the markets could greet a possible shift in  strategy as welcome recognition that new ideas are needed to pull  Europe out of its economic and financial tailspin. Or they could  view it as a worrisome relaxation of fiscal stringency and push up  borrowing costs for nations such as Spain and Italy, causing  another escalation of the crisis.   But popularly elected governments should not allow markets to call  the shots, said Juan Somavia, director-general of the International  Labor Organization.   ""In a democracy, it is more important to retain the long-term trust  of people -- especially the most vulnerable groups -- than to gain  the short-term confidence of financial markets,"" Somavia wrote in a  recent opinion piece.   Increasing numbers of economists and analysts warn that the  single-minded focus on belt-tightening is stunting growth, and  without growth there is no way out of Europe's financial hole.   ""This austerity has to end, and both the political establishment  here and Europe have to get that message,"" said literature  professor Magda Christidou, 48, who joined a May Day protest in  Athens. ""People are suffering. They're jumping off balconies and  hanging themselves because they can't take it anymore.""   Greeks have seen their standard of living plunge after budget cuts  demanded by creditors as a condition of Athens' two international  bailouts. Yet another austerity package is to come before lawmakers  next month.   Antonis Samaras of the conservative New Democracy party, which  leads the opinion polls for Sunday's parliamentary elections, has  alarmed some European officials by vowing to renegotiate elements  of the rescue deal, which he says is killing, not saving, the Greek  economy. Anger over the harsh conditions also has boosted the  fortunes of several fringe parties that are expected to win a crop  of seats in the Greek parliament.   Among them is Golden Dawn, a far-right, anti-austerity group that  is on track for its strongest showing ever at the ballot box.  Similar parties are on the rise across the region, including  France, where the vociferously anti-Europe National Front scored a  record 18 percent in the first round of the presidential election  on April 22.   But even mainstream politicians are challenging policy decisions  made in Brussels rather than in national capitals, or by powerful  leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.   ""It's not for Germany to decide for the rest of Europe,"" declared  Francois Hollande, the French left-wing Socialist candidate who is  expected to defeat incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday's runoff.   Hollande has become the highest-profile and most influential  advocate of a reset of the current strategy to combat the debt  crisis.   With public opinion behind him, he has promised to reverse some of  Sarkozy's cutbacks. Throwing down the gauntlet to Germany, Hollande  also wants to revise the new treaty to cap public spending, which  Merkel considers the cornerstone of her crisis-fighting policy.   France has not formally ratified the pact. (Neither has Germany,  for that matter.) Hollande says that fiscal rigor can't be the  be-all and end-all, and he insists that Europe come up with an  agreement on measures to promote economic growth in suffering  countries.   That view is gaining currency across the continent, on the streets  and in the corridors of power, so much so that European leaders  might cobble together such a deal at a summit next month.   For Brady at the Center for European Reform, time is of the  essence.   ""At some point, voters are going to have to step in and say, 'Snap  out of this navel-gazing and address the problems here and now,' ""  he said. ""It could be equally destabilizing. But I have faith in  democracy to do the right thing at the end of the day.""   ----------  hchu@tribune.com Credit: By Henry Chu, Tribune Newspapers  Special correspondents Anthee Carassava in Athens and Lauren Frayers in Barcelona, Spain, contributed.

263,1520620700.xml,"       In the worst day of bloodshed yet, armed clashes left scores of  people dead in Ukraine on Friday as President Barack Obama and  German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to impose far stiffer  economic sanctions on Russia if it disrupts upcoming Ukrainian  elections, effectively setting a new trigger. Officials said 42 people were killed in battles between government  supporters and Russian-backed separatists in the southern city of  Odessa, which has largely escaped violence until now. The Black Sea  port is predominantly Russian-speaking, but physically and  culturally closer to the pro-European western areas of Ukraine.  Thirty people died when fire and smoke engulfed the central trade  union building, where pro-Russia separatists were said to be  shooting from upper floors at pro-unity demonstrators in the  streets, police said.  Eight others died when they jumped out of the burning building,  authorities said.  The deadly blaze followed a day of running street battles in the  historic port. At one point, rival groups of protesters converged,  setting off a melee of hurled Molotov cocktails, stun grenades and  cobblestones, according to news agency reports. That clash left  four dead and at least 15 wounded, police said.  In eastern Ukraine, the focus of the deepening crisis, pro-Russian  rebels shot down two Ukrainian MI-24 military helicopters trying to  retake the separatist stronghold of Slovyansk, one of more than a  dozen cities held by the rebels.  The fledgling government in Kiev has launched an offensive in the  Slovyansk area with armored columns and aircraft, but so far its  troops have struggled to gain ground.  Ukrainian officials said two soldiers were killed and seven  injured, but most of the city of 130,000 apparently was still in  rebel hands.  ""We are holding on to our positions and are not planning a  retreat,"" the self-proclaimed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav  Ponomaryov, said in a telephone interview.  He said six military inspectors from the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe and their translator, who were abducted  by separatists April 25, ""are well and taken care of in a safe  place in town.""  The day's death toll was the highest in more than two months of  turmoil in eastern and southern Ukraine.  Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, blamed Moscow for  fueling the growing violence, and accused pro-Russian forces of  hiding behind civilians.  ""Our power structures are engaged in a fight with mercenaries from  a foreign state and criminals which take hostages, kill and torture  people,"" Turchynov said in a televised address.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on the interim  government in Kiev to withdraw its military from the east, ceding  control to the separatists. Moscow has deployed tens of thousands  of Russian troops near its border with Ukraine and claimed the  right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians.  Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the ITAR-Tass news agency  Friday that Russia ""is making efforts to de-escalate and resolve  the conflict"" and blamed Kiev for a ""punitive operation"" in  Slovyansk that hurt chances for peace.  In Washington, Obama and Merkel presented a united front against  Russia at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden. The two  leaders threatened broad sanctions against Russia's major economic  sectors if Moscow does not rein in the armed militants who have  destabilized eastern Ukraine and threaten to disrupt presidential  elections later this month.  ""The next step is going to be a broader-based sectoral sanctions  regime,"" Obama said. ""If in fact we see the disruptions and the  destabilization continuing so severely that it impedes elections on  May 25, we will not have a choice but to move forward with  additional, more severe sanctions.""  Obama has warned of tougher penalties if Putin ordered his troops  to invade Ukraine. But U.S. and European travel bans and asset  freezes on several dozen of Putin's political allies and business  associates, plus a handful of banks and companies, have shown no  sign of persuading the Russian leader to pull his troops.  On Friday, the two leaders appeared to adjust the trigger point for  more aggressive action, with Merkel calling the elections  ""crucial.""  The recalibration reflects a growing view in the West that the  upcoming elections present the best, if still long-shot, hope for a  peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis.  Obama vented frustration with Putin's claims that Russia is not  supporting the militants.  ""Generally, local protesters don't possess that capacity of  surface-to-air missiles or whatever weapons were used to shoot down  helicopters,"" he said.  Germany, the largest economy in Europe, is viewed as a linchpin in  the West's attempts to craft a unified response to the Ukraine  conflict.  The German economy is closely linked to Russia, especially its  energy supplies, and major German businesses and industries have  lobbied against imposing penalties that will damage their bottom  line.  ---------- khennessey@tribune.com Credit: By Kathleen Hennessey and Sergei L.

264,1783859461.xml,"       Obama rejects N. Korea's demand U.S. end drills President Barack Obama said the U.S. won't back down from strengthening its military alliances and defenses against North Korea until the country ""shows seriousness"" toward eliminating nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.   ""If North Korea shows seriousness in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, then we will be ready to engage in serious conversations with them to reduce tensions,"" Obama said Sunday at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Hannover, Germany, the final stop of a three-nation international tour.   North Korea would ""have to do better"" than announcing ""via press release"" that it intends to step back from nuclear weapons development, he said.   North Korea on Saturday test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine, according to the U.S. Strategic Command. It wasn't clear how far the missile flew, and the U.S. said it ""did not pose a threat to North America."" The move was the latest in a string of military provocations from the regime of Kim Jong Un.   North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong told The Associated Press on Sunday the country was willing to halt its nuclear tests if the U.S. suspended annual joint military exercises with South Korea.   The U.S. and South Korea intensified the military exercises, which are expected to continue through the month, after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. Approximately 300,000 South Korea troops and 17,000 U.S. troops are participating in the drills, according to the joint U.S. and South Korean military command.  At hill service, Armenians mark 1915 massacre   American actor George Clooney on Sunday joined Armenians marking 101 years since a massacre by Ottoman Turks of some 1.5 million ethnic Armenians.   Clooney attended a service at a hilltop memorial in the capital, Yerevan, led by Armenian Church leader Catholicos Karekin II to commemorate the victims of the massacre. Modern Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, vehemently rejects that the deaths constitute genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest.  Suicide attacks target Iraqi troops; 14 killed   BAGHDAD -- Suicide attacks targeting security forces in two Baghdad suburbs have killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens, officials said Sunday.   A suicide car bomb struck a checkpoint in the eastern suburb of Husseiniyah late Saturday, killing six civilians and four soldiers, a police officer said. The Islamic State group claimed the attack. Another police officer said a suicide car bomb struck a passing military convoy in the southern suburb of Arab Jabour, killing four soldiers.  Israel frees Arab girl, 12, who was planning attack   HEBRON, West Bank -- A 12-year-old Palestinian girl, imprisoned by Israel after she confessed to planning a stabbing attack on Israelis in a West Bank settlement, returned home Sunday after she was freed early following an appeal.   Dima al-Wawi is believed to be the youngest female Palestinian ever imprisoned. According to court documents, she approached the settlement of Carmei Tsur on Feb. 9 with a knife under a shirt before surrendering the weapon when she was stopped and questioned.  Report: Mexican cops beat abduction suspects   MEXICO CITY -- There is strong evidence that Mexican police tortured some suspects arrested in the disappearance of 43 students, according to a report released Sunday by an outside group.   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expert group says that a study of 17 of the approximately 123 suspects arrested in the case showed signs of beatings. The 43 students have not been heard from since they were taken by local police in September 2014 in Guerrero state.  THE NEWSMAKER   El-Sissi urges defense of Egypt ahead of protests   Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi urged citizens to defend the state and its institutions from the ""forces of evil"" on Sunday, a day before planned demonstrations against his policies, including the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia.  Slaying of 8 relatives in Ohio is called planned   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Attorney General Mike DeWine said Sunday that the slayings of eight family members in rural southern Ohio on Friday ""was a pre-planned execution"" and he expects the investigation will be lengthy.   The killings at four different homes near Piketon was ""a sophisticated operation,"" DeWine said at a news conference. Authorities found marijuana-growing operations at three of the four locations of the shootings, but DeWine would not say what, if any, role they had in the deaths.  Far-right strong in first round of Austrian vote   VIENNA -- Initial results show that the candidate of Austria's right-wing, anti-immigrant party has swept the first round of Austria's presidential elections, gathering over 35 percent of the vote and leaving the other five candidates far behind.   The apparent triumph by Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party reflects widespread voter dissatisfaction with the center-left Social Democrats and the centrist People's Party. Hofer is expected to face a challenger in a runoff on May 22.  Serbia's pro-EU party wins vote in early results   BELGRADE, Serbia -- The incumbent pro-European Union populists swept Serbia's parliamentary election in a landslide Sunday, leaving pro-Russia nationalists far behind, according to preliminary unofficial results.   The independent CESID polling agency shows Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic's Progressive Party winning 49 percent of the vote and its Socialists coalition partner with 11 percent.

265,2338913957.xml,"Many women are acquainted with a certain type of boyfriend. He's generous with gifts, meals and compliments. In public, he's the picture of devotion. But when you need him, he's not there. When you have a problem, it's your fault. Eventually, you have to accept: He's just not that into you. For the U.S. military, Donald Trump is that kind of boyfriend. He claims to be their greatest champion. But by now it should be clear he doesn't really love our men and women in uniform. He's merely using them.He's even open to renting them out. He explained his deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia: ""I said, 'Listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops? I'm going to send them to you, but you have to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank.'""The drone attack that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani was not really about protecting Americans. The Wall Street Journal reported that after the strike, Trump ""told associates he was under pressure to deal with Gen. Soleimani from GOP senators he views as important supporters in his coming impeachment trial in the Senate."" Soldiers who survived a subsequent Iranian missile attack on their base in Iraq now know they could have died to help Trump survive impeachment.His latest breach of faith is taking funds from our armed forces to build his border wall. The Washington Post reports that he intends to divert $7.2 billion this year. After he did the same thing last year, the Post noted, the Pentagon had to postpone or suspend an array of projects, ""including road repairs, a waste treatment plant and school construction projects on military bases."" The children of soldiers bear the burden of the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for.When it comes to supporting our troops, Trump is reliably unreliable. It took him nearly three years to make his first visit to Afghanistan -- something Barack Obama did three months into his first term. On Veterans Day 2018, Trump didn't bother visiting Arlington National Cemetery, claiming he was ""extremely busy on calls for the country.""That no-show came after he skipped a ceremony in France honoring Americans killed in World War I. He blamed the rain, though French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel braved the elements to be there.The signals of disrespect are big and small. During the campaign, Trump mocked John McCain's credentials as a war hero and insulted a Gold Star family. He sent troops to the southern border just before the 2018 elections -- which former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey called ""a wasteful deployment of over-stretched soldiers and Marines.""He offered a crass account of family members at Dover Air Force Base when the bodies of those killed in action are returned: ""They'll break through military barriers, they'll run to the coffin and jump on the coffin. Crying mothers and wives, crying desperately."" Retired Adm. James Stavridis rebuked him for this violation of their privacy: ""It's inappropriate. That's why we don't have cameras in situations like that.""Trump has no use for the rules that our service personnel have been trained to follow. He proved that in the case of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL commander court-martialed on charges of murder and attempted murder after being accused by members of his team, who called him ""freaking evil"" and a ""psychopath.""Gallagher was convicted only of posing with a corpse, but Trump pardoned him and extolled him as a hero. When the Navy moved to demote Gallagher, Trump intervened to protect him.The president treats accomplished, battle-tested military leaders as if they were caddies at Trump National Doral. During the campaign, he boasted, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" After a SEAL was killed during a 2017 raid in Yemen, he blamed military leaders. ""This was something they wanted to do,"" he said. ""And they lost (him).""But when missions go well, Trump rushes to take credit. After the raid that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, he bragged: ""I've been looking for him for three years."" The Delta Force commandos who risked their lives were turned into supporting players in Trump's brassy theater of self-glorification.They should not have been surprised. When Trump looks at the military, he's not thinking: ""What can I do for our troops?"" He's thinking, ""What can our troops do for me?""----------Steve Chapman, a member of the Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/chapman.schapman@chicagotribune.comTwitter @SteveChapman13CAPTION: Photo: U.S. soldiers cheer as President Donald Trump arrives at Bagram Air Field for a Thanksgiving visit last year.

266,1011170933.xml,"      Greek conservatives won at the polls Sunday in national elections but fell far short of enough seats to take power, deadlocking parliament and deepening unease over the country's economic future and its continued membership in the eurozone. With 72 percent of the votes counted, Antonis Samaras and his center-right New Democracy party had 19.7 percent of the vote, giving them 111 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament. Samaras, 61, has three days to try to form a coalition before passing on the task to the runner-up party.   With the parliament split among at least seven parties -- many of them formed in protest of austerity cuts that have crippled the economy -- the electoral result could take weeks to untangle at a time when Europe's debt crisis threatens to flare up again.   It's the most fractured legislature in Greece since the restoration of democracy in 1974.   ""This is a seismic political shift,"" said Dimitris Mavros, managing director of the MRB polling group, adding: ""We're looking at the end of a political era in which the conservatives and Socialists dominated the political spectrum. Voter intent (was) clear: to demolish that system and produce a new, highly fragmented political kaleidoscope.""   The uncertainty could spook investors who are left to wonder whether Greece will stick to the terms of two international bailouts that have enabled the country to avoid default but have plunged the economy into a deep recession through multiple rounds of spending cuts.   Samaras has vowed to try to renegotiate elements of the rescue packages, while most of the fringe parties that made gains in Sunday's vote reject the bailout terms. Those anti-austerity groups include the radical leftist Syriza party, which unseated scores of Socialist and conservative backbenchers and came in second with 16.3 percent and 50 seats.   The far-right Golden Dawn party, which has sparked concern with its anti-immigrant stand, won 6.9 percent of the vote and 21 seats.   ""Athens will have to show that it wants to make the effort to stay in the eurozone,"" said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, referring to the 17 nations that use the euro. ""If it doesn't, then that could spark contagion"" of Europe's debt crisis to larger nations such as Italy and Spain.   The Socialists emerged as the big loser Sunday. Under a new leader, former Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, the party managed to gain 42 seats with 13.6 percent of the vote, down 30 percentage points from its landslide victory in 2009.   Both Samaras and Venizelos were distraught over the poor performance of their respective parties, once the dominant forces in Greek politics.   By contrast, Alexis Tsipras, who heads the new leftist Syriza party, flashed a victory sign to supporters.   He billed his victory a ""peaceful revolution"" and warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that ""her fiscal-austerity policy has been defeated.""   For Samaras, 37, stitching together a coalition will be a tricky proposition.   He has already said that he would rather force another election than form a government with Venizelos, his archrival.   And even if their once-mighty parties did succeed in forming an alliance with the help of a third, smaller party, it would probably be short-lived, pundits and politicians said.   ""We have a Plan B, C and D,"" a senior adviser to Samaras said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We have to wait and see how the final chips are going to fall.""   Whatever the outcome, the new government will face a tough task. By June, Athens will have to detail about $14 billion in added cuts to cover budget gaps through 2014.   Last week, Europe's paymaster, Germany, warned Athens that any failure to meet its signed commitments would carry serious consequences.   Locked out of international markets, Greece has relied on foreign credit since its European peers and the International Monetary Fund cast Athens its first lifeline of about $150 billion in May 2010.   A deepening recession and the need for a second, $170 billion bailout, plus a massive debt-restructuring deal, forced the Socialists and New Democracy into a fractious coalition in November.   Greeks have watched their living standards plunge. The unemployment rate has soared past 21 percent and public services have collapsed.

267,1841722067.xml,"       In a brief, presumably final, encounter, President Barack Obama on Sunday appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to fulfill agreements to scale back incursions into eastern Ukraine and work with the U.S. to bring order to chaotic Syria. The night before, Obama sat with his Chinese counterpart to note important cooperation on climate change and regional security issues, particularly with regard to North Korea, before President Xi Jinping warned that relations with the U.S. were at a ""hinge moment.""   Left unsaid in the diplomatic readouts by American officials was the specter of President-elect Donald Trump and the likelihood that he would take a far different approach in managing the most complex U.S. relationships abroad.   Under different electoral circumstances, Obama's trip this past week -- his last, scheduled presidential tour overseas -- could have been something of a valedictory march: a sweeping speech on democracy in its birthplace, Greece; a final fond farewell and early endorsement in Berlin for his most important partner, German Chancellor Angela Merkel; and an economic summit here of Asian and Pacific leaders.   White House officials had even envisioned a chance of putting a bow on Obama's strategy of reorienting U.S. attention to Asia by persuading a lame-duck session of Congress to consider the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal.   Trump's election put an end to all that.   Instead, Obama was warning about the threats to democracy in an era of ""active disinformation"" that left the public struggling to separate fact from fiction. He and Merkel sternly lectured Trump from a distance about the obligations of leadership and the need to abide by international norms of behavior.   In a Sunday news conference before leaving Peru, Obama said he thinks -- though he can't guarantee -- that Trump may govern more moderately than the way he campaigned.   ""I can't be sure of anything,"" Obama said of Trump's approach. But the presidency, he said, ""has a way of shaping your thinking and in some cases modifying your thinking because you recognize the solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility America has as the most powerful country in the world.""   Obama had thought he would be handing off leadership of the Western powers to Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state who ran a campaign largely on a platform of continuing Obama's policies. Instead he appeared ready to pass that mantle off to another leader, Merkel, who now plans to seek a fourth term as chancellor.   ""I do believe that Chancellor Merkel and Germany are a linchpin in protecting the basic tenets of a liberal, market-based democratic order that has created unprecedented prosperity and security for Europe, but also for the world,"" Obama said in a joint interview with German reporters.   In his news conference, however, he cautioned against any U.S. withdrawal from leadership of global institutions, saying the world is far safer, more secure and prosperous than it was when the current international system was put into place.   ""The United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order,"" he said. ""Before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years,"" he noted. ""In the second one, 60 million people were killed,"" he added.   In Asia, ""You routinely saw famines of millions of people,"" he said.   America can't carry the sole burden of sustaining the modern global system, but other countries can't replace U.S. leadership. If the U.S. shuns the role of heading the global order, ""then it collapses ... there's nobody to fill the void,"" he said.   ""That's a burden we should carry proudly,"" Obama added.   As he concluded his trip, Obama also made clear that he plans to govern through to the final day of his term, without regard for what Trump may have in the works.   In his brief conversation with Putin, for example, he said he held fast to his position that Russia should respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and work for a peaceful resolution in Syria.   He also made clear that his administration will move ahead with new environmental rules, even though Trump and the Republicans may not like them.   The proposals are well-considered rules that have been under scrutiny and public discussion for a long time, he said, and they shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.   ""I feel strongly these are the right things to do,"" he said, ""and I'm going to do them.""   ----------  michael.memoli@latimes Credit: By Michael A.

268,420367465.xml,"         Germany's political elite spent three weeks playing the ultimate power game--""The Chancellor War."" After last month's muddled election failed to produce a clear winner, the country's political movers and shakers gathered in backrooms in Berlin to find a leader, forge a government and divvy up power in the country with the world's third largest economy.    On Monday, the process yielded the designated leader of the next government, Angela Merkel, who will become Germany's first female chancellor. Merkel's story is compelling--a Protestant minister's daughter, she was schooled in the ways of Western politics by longtime Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    She learned the nuts and bolts of governing, but she was a lousy campaigner. Merkel lost most of a 20-point lead in the polls. Her party clung to a narrow victory, though it received only 35 percent of the vote.    Still, when the backroom deals were made, Merkel held her own. She's in and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder--who stubbornly tried to cling to power even though his party got only 34 percent of the vote- -is out.    Now Merkel has to prove that she can become an agent of change in a country dealing with vast economic problems. The accommodations reached to end the political stalemate, though, will only make that task more difficult for her.    Germany could have used a dose of American-style, winner-take- all politics--one side wins, the other loses. But Germany operates under a proportional representation system, with parliamentary seats allocated by the percentage of votes. A party can lose and still claim some power. The system is designed to produce political consensus and make sure that most every vote and view is considered. That can leave people feeling empowered, but leave a government nearly powerless.    Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union are expected to preside over a fractious government that includes their rivals, the more liberal Social Democrats. Merkel and the Christian Democrats are expected to control the chancellery, six ministries and an additional government post, while the Social Democrats control eight ministries.    The odd man out is Schroeder, who is unlikely to be part of the next government. Schroeder opposed the Iraq war and irritated the Bush administration. Merkel probably will keep German troops out of Iraq, but her government's tone toward the U.S. will be more friendly.    Merkel will make a good start with improved relations with the United States. But the greater task that faces her is how to restore Germany's economy. The promise of a so-called grand coalition between rival political parties only raises more doubts that Germany has the stomach to make the necessary reforms in pensions, taxation and spending. Voters shied away from a bold break to bring Germany's economy into the future, so political leaders made a deal that may only allow their nation to tread water.  ",2005-10-11
269,2571563241.xml,"They call him ""the plagiarism hunter."" He calls himself ""meticulous"" and an ""addict.""  However he is characterized, in German-speaking countries where titles are important signals of social standing, Stefan Weber is the undisputed terror of academics, politicians, celebrities and a panoply of other potential culprits.Weber, an Austrian communications professor, has ended the careers of several people and made life difficult for many others. And what started as a hobby has now developed into a business with five freelance ""collaborators,"" as he calls them, working with him to reveal the misdoings of lazy, sloppy or downright sneaky writers.His latest target: Annalena Baerbock, the Green Party candidate to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor in elections this month.Weber, 51, got started on what would become his life's work in 2005, when he himself was plagiarized by a German theologian, Joachim Fels, who explained that his failure to acknowledge Weber's work properly in his doctoral dissertation was the result of an editorial mishap.Weber's public complaint ultimately triggered a university investigation revealing that 86% of the first 100 pages of Fels' dissertation was plagiarized from Weber's work. The fraud was covered prominently in major news media outlets; Fels was ultimately stripped of his doctorate.In the intervening years, armed only with commercial software and a nearly photographic memory, Weber has gone after a variety of prominent figures, including, most recently, Baerbock.Following allegations that she embellished her CV, Weber ran her newly published book, ""Now: How We Renew Our Country,"" through Turnitin and other plagiarism-detection programs. It marked at least 12 passages as almost identical with other sources.""Willful deceit,"" said Weber, who once worked as a tabloid journalist.As the issue played out in front-page articles, experts cautioned against applying standards for doctoral dissertations to a short nonfiction book by a politician. Many saw a concerted campaign to discredit a highly accomplished woman, while others wondered if the far-right had bankrolled Weber's research. (He said it did not.)Still, the episode strengthened a sense of Baerbock as ""dubious and sloppy,"" Weber said. The number of passages in the book found to be cribbed from blogs, news columns, books and the Greens' election program has since grown to more than 100. She led the polls in the spring, and her support has since dropped to less than 20%, though the plagiarism scandal is not the only factor.Critics describe him as a persnickety crusader who takes pleasure in character assassination. Even his supporters acknowledge that his drive to hold writers, academics and others to the highest standards can be vexing.""He always wants to be the best, and he also demands that of others,"" said Peter Bruck, a former academic mentor to Weber.""I know when I'm annoying people with my meticulousness,"" Weber said over lunch at an Italian restaurant near his office in a scruffy industrial district on the outskirts of Salzburg, Austria, while explaining the business side of things.That consists of investigating academics' publications, court experts' opinions and books, for which he bills as much as $400 an hour. But the bulk of his clients typically fall into two categories: men seeking to discredit their ex-wives amid or after a divorce (but never vice versa) and people trying to undermine their neighbors' credibility in nasty disputes over property lines.He said he now receives about 50 inquiries a month and that people have begun sending him tips on big cases like the one he mounted against Christine Aschbacher, the Austrian labor minister who stepped down in January after a plagiarism scandal.""It's a gold mine,"" he said of Austrians' schadenfreude.Weber took an odd life route to his current station. Born in Salzburg to a strict and controlling office clerk father who checked his school bag each evening and a mother who worked as a homemaker, young Stefan Weber showed early signs of being a math prodigy.""May you remain humble in triumph,"" a teacher cautioned the 11-year-old Weber, who excelled in most subjects.As a student at the University of Salzburg, Weber realized that the triumph his teacher had foreseen long ago was not going to be found in math. Despite his prodigious memory, he was unable to follow the university math professors and instead turned to ""the idiot degree everyone studies: communications.""Communications was a breeze, and Weber went on to teach at eight universities of applied sciences in Austria and Germany, always vying for tenure. He never attained it.At 37, Weber moved to Dresden, Germany, where his partner at the time worked as a civil servant. While helping to care for their two children, Maximilian and Anna, he taught at universities and worked as a communications consultant.He also published books critiquing new media and continued to work with Bruck, who still lauds Weber's intellect and ambition but has little patience for his new career. ""From a useful tracker, he transformed into an illegitimate detractor,"" he wrote in a 2007 op-ed rebuking Weber for accusing Johannes Hahn, then Austria's science minister, of plagiarism. (Hahn was eventually cleared of the accusation.)In 2014 Weber returned to Salzburg, splitting with his former partner the following year.Most of those he has named and shamed have neither lost their titles nor jobs, Weber said, pointing to Hahn, who went on to become a European Union commissioner. This year, however, when he exposed ""plagiarism, wrong citations and poor knowledge of German"" in the academic work of Aschbacher, she stepped down within two days.For more than a decade, Weber promoted plagiarism as a discipline worthy of publicly funded research, but it was only with the Aschbacher case that the government began to take notice. ""Only since politics has been hit,"" he said, ""has politics become interested.""Now, with government funding, he is evaluating how Austria's universities deploy plagiarism-detection software and is creating a Wiki that is to become the ultimate guide to proper sourcing, quoting and referencing. Eventually, he said, he wants to raise standards so high that he puts himself out of work.But for now, he needs to scan and digitize the dissertations of two high-ranking civil servants. Weber picked up the bound volumes from the passenger-side floor of his navy blue Volkswagen and noted that they were written in the aughts, a time when plagiarism flourished.""That's already making me suspicious,"" he said with a mischievous grin.CAPTION: Photo: Stefan Weber, an Austrian communications professor and self-appointed plagiarist hunter, in Salzburg, Austria.

270,2119842666.xml,"Voters in the southern German heartland of Bavaria appeared to have dealt a stinging blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative allies Sunday.  The result, if confirmed, marks a humbling moment for the Christian Social Union, a party that has governed for decades, while boosting the fortunes of players to the left and the right in an election defined by polarized opinions about immigration.Votes for the Bavarian state parliament rarely have been competitive in modern lifetimes. The CSU has been a juggernaut of postwar Bavaria, leading the region for 61 consecutive years and rarely needing a partner to do so.The party is expected to continue to govern even after Sunday's election. But projected results based on exit polls Sunday evening showed the CSU's share of the vote falling dramatically, from nearly half in 2013 to barely more than one-third, with 35.5 percent. Parties on either ideological flank -- the Greens on the left, with an estimated 19 percent, and the Alternative for Germany on the far right, with 11 percent -- severely dented the CSU's traditional dominance.If the results hold, the CSU will need to cut a deal with one or more rivals to stay in power in a state known for its Alpine beauty as well as its industrial might.The projected results sent a stream of green confetti raining down on jubilant Greens activists at the party's election night headquarters. There was a similarly exuberant celebration among AfD supporters.It was a different story for the CSU, with a stern-faced Bavarian state premier Markus Soder telling the party faithful that the result ""isn't easy.""""We will accept it with humility. We will need to learn from it. We need to analyze it precisely,"" he said.But Soder insisted the CSU will continue to lead the state's government, despite a result that is the party's second worst in its history. The CSU, he said, ""isn't only the strongest party, but it received a clear mandate to govern.""The election was watched closely in Germany, and the results appear to fit a pattern seen within the country and across the continent. Traditional centrist parties that once flirted with absolute majorities of the vote are withering. Niche and politically extreme parties are gaining as the electorate fragments into ever finer shards.At the national level, that has meant a record seven parties in the parliament since elections last year and a deeply dysfunctional governing coalition of three.Sunday's result likely will reverberate loudly in Berlin, where it will be seen as yet another blow to Merkel's once-mighty fusion of her own Christian Democratic Union with its Bavarian sister, the CSU.Since the CDU/CSU faction disappointed in last year's vote, Merkel has seen her authority diminish at home and abroad as she has struggled to cling to a job she has held for 13 years.Yet the CSU's apparent humiliation also could make Merkel's life easier in one respect: Her primary rival within the government, Interior Minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer, likely will face calls to resign.Seehofer has provoked repeated clashes with his boss this year about immigration.CAPTION: Photo: Robert Habeck, center, co-leader of the Greens, reacts after the first exit polls Sunday.

271,1317581705.xml,"       Facing global market turmoil, Cyprus on Monday ordered its banks shut through Thursday, delaying a key parliamentary debate on whether to impose a levy of up to 10 percent on bank deposits in exchange for a $13 billion international bailout. European banks and officials also weighed in, allowing Cyprus' newly elected government time and leeway to revise parts of the controversial bailout.  The rescue would see funds from Europe and the International Monetary Fund pour in to prop up the island republic's faltering banks. Money would also come from the tax on bank deposits, a controversial feature not included in the bailouts of other countries.  Failure to push the bailout plan through the 54-seat parliament -- the vote was planned for Monday, then pushed back to Tuesday -- could lead to a chaotic default that would further endanger the fate of Europe's single currency, the euro, which has been caught in a stubborn debt crisis for five years.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, a conservative who was elected just three weeks ago, said in a nationally televised address over the weekend that the deposit tax was the only alternative to a disorderly bankruptcy.  The unprecedented scheme, part of a bailout package hammered out by European officials over the weekend, would subject account holders with more than $130,000 to a 9.9 percent tax and those with less to a 6.75 percent levy.  Anastasiades acknowledged that the plan was painful but said it would ""eventually stabilize the economy and lead it to recovery.""  He vowed to try to modify some elements of the plan to protect small savers. The Reuters news agency reported that officials were hoping to cut the tax to 3 percent for deposits under $130,000 and increase the rate to 12.5 percent for larger deposits.  Still, critics warned, by forcing common Cypriots to pony up much of the bailout funds needed for the banks' rescue, the European Union was not only breaching its own rules of protecting depositors' savings, but setting a precedent that could spook people in other countries with troubled banking sectors.  The worst fear is that savers in larger European countries become nervous and start withdrawing funds, although there was no sign of that Monday.  ""If I were a saver, certainly in Spain or maybe Italy, I think I'd be looking askance at these measures and think this could yet happen to me,"" said Peter Dixon, global financial economist at Commerzbank.  Fears of fallout from the Cyprus plan shook global markets. The euro fell sharply, and in the U.S., the Dow dipped 62 points.  A favorite tax haven for Russian oligarchs, the island holds some $24 billion in Russian-controlled bank accounts, according to reports attributed to the German national intelligence agency. That, according to analysts and officials, appeared to be one reason that Germany insisted on the levy, fearing that European bailout funds would sink in a pit of corruption.  ""German Chancellor Angela Merkel is up for re-election this fall,"" said Napoleon Marveyas, professor of economics at the University of Athens. ""There is no way she would have convinced her own to effectively come to the rescue of Russian oligarchs."" Credit: By Anthee Carassava, Tribune Newspapers; Reuters contributed.

273,1319441737.xml,"       Mention the tiny island nation of Cyprus, and the first thing that  comes to my mind is Paul Newman and ""Exodus."" In the 1960 film of  Leon Uris' novel, Newman stars as Zionist leader Ari Ben Canaan,  who goes to Cyprus in 1947 to rescue Jewish refugees being held in  British internment camps. All it takes is a borrowed ship, a few forged signatures, a hunger  strike, and a threat to blow up the vessel and everyone on it to  persuade the British to allow the renamed Exodus to set sail for  Palestine.  Today's plot involving Cyprus is more complicated. Any resolution  will be less uplifting. And the heroes, if there are any, have yet  to emerge.  The story so far: As a precondition for a 10 billion-euro ($13  billion) bailout of its financial system, Cyprus was told by  eurozone finance ministers, the International Monetary Fund and the  European Central Bank that it had to contribute 5.8 billion euros  by levying a tax on bank deposits: insured and uninsured, at sick  and well-capitalized banks.  The Cypriot parliament on Tuesday rejected the ""solidarity levy"" --  the only solidarity was the opposition to it -- sending the parties  back to the drawing board and newly elected Cyprus President Nicos  Anastasiades looking for alternative financing, perhaps from  Russia.  Without a capital infusion, Cyprus' two largest banks will  collapse, destabilizing the financial system and presaging an early  exit from the 17-member euro area. Oh, and that guarantee of  deposit insurance on accounts up to 100,000 euros? Sorry.  The issues: Why the authorities decided that when it comes to  Cyprus, the last (depositors) will be first, and the first not at  all, is anybody's guess. Although it's true Cyprus' banks are  largely deposit-funded, why not give the bailout a patina of  respectability by making the senior bondholders take a hit? That's  standard when it comes to resolving insolvent financial  institutions.  Instead, Europe's leaders chose an arbitrary policy that sets a bad  precedent and carries a scary message: Your deposits aren't safe.  The state can confiscate them any time it wants. Even the Russians,  who excel at seizing entire fortunes and portfolios of companies,  are up in arms.  The politics: Facing parliamentary elections in September and  pressure from both sides, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in no  position to offer up bailout-weary taxpayers as sacrificial lambs.  Because Cyprus is reputed to be a haven for Russian money  laundering, supporting a deposit tax enabled Merkel to strut her  populist credentials by sticking it to Russian oligarchs.  Anastasiades didn't want to jeopardize Russia's 2.5 billion-euro  line of credit by forcing large depositors to absorb the entire  hit. The initial plan had the government imposing a tax of 6.75  percent on all bank deposits of less than 100,000 euros -- the  deposit-insurance limit -- and 9.9 percent on larger accounts.  What's more, Russian banks have loans to Cypriot companies, which  may be fronts for Russian companies. Lastly, Russian energy giant  OAO Gazprom reportedly offered to prop up Cyprus' banks in exchange  for natural-gas exploration rights.  The implications: Cyprus is a small country. It is three-fifths the  size of Connecticut with a population of 1.1 million, annual output  of $23.6 billion (less than 0.2 percent of the eurozone economy)  and a banking system more than eight times the size. What happens  in Cyprus isn't supposed to affect the entire eurozone. Instead,  events of the past week may turn out to be a bigger deal than the  country's size alone would suggest.  First, the decision to tax depositors represents a confiscation of  private property. If a country is willing to cross that line once,  the second time is a lot easier.  Second, violating a guarantee of deposit insurance in one country  creates anxiety in others and undermines efforts to institute  uniform banking practices across the euro area. It's puzzling why  depositors in countries such as Spain and Italy aren't aggressively  withdrawing money from their accounts. For the small price of 17.57  euros a person, European leaders could have raised the same amount  of money and preserved the sanctity of deposit insurance, according  to Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in  Valhalla, N.Y.  Third, the decisions taken by European governments this week may  hasten the single currency's demise. They are using what amounts to  ""blackmail to confiscate deposits,"" said Athanasios Orphanides, a  former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus. ""What we are  witnessing is the slow death of the European project.""  Which brings us to the real issue: The European monetary union was  never a real union. Nor does it seem to be moving in that  direction. Yes, these 17 countries share a common currency, a  common market and common rules. They even give voice to a common  purpose. But people still think of themselves as German or French  or Cypriot first, not European.  Their actions are at odds, as well. Despite Europe's social  democratic foundation, decisions are still made by governments (in  general, Germany's) on the basis of what's good for the  nation-state, not the whole.  Banks in Cyprus remain closed until the authorities can arrange for  security to deal with an onslaught of angry depositors. A mass  exodus would be no surprise, even without Paul Newman.

274,1636645100.xml,"       On a velvety green patch of the French  countryside, organic farmer Jean Cabaret gave a little shudder. A  looming trade deal with the United States, he fears, may make his  worst culinary nightmare come true: an invasion of Europe by  American ""Frankenfoods."" ""Hormone-boosted beef. Chlorine-washed chicken. Genetically altered  vegetables. This is what they want for us,"" warned Cabaret,  standing before his majestic herd of free-range cows. ""In France,  food is about pleasure, about taste. But in the United States, they  put anything in their mouths. No, this must be stopped.""  In Europe, this is a season of angst -- even paranoia -- over a  historic bid to link the United States and the 28-nation European  Union in the world's largest free-trade deal.  Passage of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or  TTIP, could be a globalization milestone, creating a megamarket of  800 million consumers from Alaska to Finland, Hawaii to Greece.  Import duties, many of which already are low, could be further  reduced.  More important, the deal could finally tackle non-tariff barriers,  including differing data protection and food safety standards that  have long stood in the way of trans-Atlantic commerce.  But even as time is running out for President Barack Obama to sign  a deal before leaving office, European and U.S. advocates have been  surprised by the increasingly hostile reception on this side of the  Atlantic. It is jeopardizing the chances of a deal that proponents  say could create millions of new jobs by dramatically boosting  U.S.-EU trade.  There is dissent in the United States, too, where some critics fear  Washington may bargain away the ""Buy America"" clauses that give  U.S. companies an edge in government contracts. But in Europe, no  single issue is inflaming the debate more than food -- specifically  U.S. calls for Europe to open its door to long-banned American  foodstuffs that are hormone-treated, chemically sanitized or  genetically modified.  Many European critics also are taking aim at other aspects of the  deal, with the most flustered opponents insisting it could usher in  an era of American-style capitalism to Europe that puts  corporations and consumerism above all else.  ""With these talks, you are seeing the European fear of  globalization turning into something more specific -- a fear of  America,"" said Thomas Snegaroff, a French radio commentator and  U.S. expert at the Paris-based Institute for Strategic and  International Relations.  Leading European food safety authorities have determined that  several U.S. practices in contention, such as sanitizing poultry in  lightly chlorinated water, are safe. Yet increasingly, the debate  here is not just about health but what European critics decry as  ""less natural"" methods deployed by mass producers of food in the  United States.  It is pitting science against food culture in places such as  France, where gourmands are lamenting widespread industrialization  on farms in the country and the growing practice of Paris bistros  serving flash-frozen meals to unsuspecting diners. Letting in  artificially treated U.S. foods, they warn, could water down French  cuisine even more, leading to pool-scented chicken chunks served  with flavorless sides of bionic broccoli.  ""If this happens, if these U.S. foods come into Europe, we are  talking about more than safety risks,"" said gourmand and food  writer Camille Labro. ""You are afraid of food in the United States.  You have to blast it with chemicals to kill all the bacteria. Don't  you know what that does to flavor? If we allow that kind of food  here, we are talking about the death of taste.""  French opponents are staging events nationwide in which activists  dressed as chickens are handing out fliers at grocery stores,  calling all concerned citizens to town hall meetings aimed at  ""educating"" society on the dangers of TTIP. That move comes after  actors in chicken outfits in one French protest troupe dubbed the  ""chicken brigade"" tried to ""chlorinate themselves"" in a public  pool.  French President Francois Hollande has openly backed the trade  deal. But in an interview with The Washington Post, Matthias Fekl,  France's new secretary of state for foreign trade, said he could  not envision any deal that opens the door to controversial U.S.  foods.  ""This is about lifestyle, about way of life,"" Fekl said. ""Nothing  will force us to expand entry into Europe of chlorinated chicken or  hormone beef.""  In October, tens of thousands of people from 22 EU countries took  to the streets to protest the deal. The protests included flash  mobs in Belgium and a demonstration in Copenhagen that used a  24-foot Trojan horse to symbolize the hidden risks of the trade  deal. Even in Britain, a nation hardly known for the glories of its  national cuisine, fear and loathing of modified American foods, and  the trade deal in general, appear to be running surprisingly  strong.  An August poll by YouGov found that only 13 percent of Britons were  in favor of TTIP, while 39 percent were opposed.  ""It's possibly one of the most dangerous agreements,"" the British  TV chef Jamie Oliver told The Times of London. He added: ""We don't  have hormones in our meat; that's banned. But not over there. We  don't have hundreds of poisons and pesticides that have been proven  to be carcinogenic. They do.""  U.S. officials and food producers call European fears misguided,  describing U.S. standards of food safety as among the highest in  the world. U.S. officials point to studies showing U.S. standard  practices including chlorine washing of chickens as unquestionably  safe.  ""We're not trying to force anybody to eat anything,"" said Michael  Froman, the U.S. trade representative. But, he added, ""we do feel  like the decision as to what is safe should be made by science.""  It was the European Union, a region mired in stagnant growth and a  crisis of unemployment, that approached the Obama administration  about a prospective trade deal.  The administration seized the opportunity, opening talks in 2013  and making a deal with Europe, as well as raising hopes for an  ambitious agreement with Asia, the cornerstone of its trade policy.  Leading European leaders, including British Prime Minister David  Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, remain firmly behind  TTIP.  In recent months, chances of any major breakthrough have been  hindered by elections on both sides of the Atlantic. An eighth  round of talks is set for February.  Given the lengthy process for legislative approvals required in  Europe and the United States, however, analysts say a deal must  come together by late 2015 or early 2016 if Obama is to sign it.  Otherwise, an agreement will rest in the hands of the incoming  administration.  In some EU countries including Poland and Sweden there appears to  be solid support. But in other nations, the opposition seems to be  less rooted in more than just food.  In Europe, a certain brand of anti-Americanism is almost always  just under the surface on the political left and the far right. But  with the TTIP talks, at least some of those sentiments appear to be  going mainstream. In parts of Europe, including Germany -- a nation  still smarting from revelations of U.S. spying -- staunch  opposition has built up around the possible inclusion of an  investor-rights clause in TTIP.  Often viewed as almost perfunctory in trade deals, such clauses  allow companies to take governments to arbitration if the companies  think investor rights are being violated. But loud European critics  insist that the provisions could give U.S. corporations the legal  leverage they need to challenge everything from Europe's high  environmental standards to its universal health care systems.  Such fears may not be as broadly held in Europe as opponents  suggest. But their frequent public airing has made the debate over  TTIP in Germany increasingly personal. During a recent skit on the  popular ""Heute-Show,"" a sort of German version of ""The Daily Show,""  host Oliver Welke pretended to address the U.S. Congress.  Calling for an end to the trade talks, he quipped: ""The dirt of  your broken colony is spilling into Europe. We endured  cheeseburgers, Halloween and 'Baywatch,' and our asses will soon be  as big as those of your fat wives.""  He concluded with a statement in German that roughly translates as,  ""Why don't you shove your free-trade agreement where the sun  doesn't shine?""

275,420689516.xml,"      Over the past decade, as borders and barriers across an increasingly integrated Europe seemingly fell with each passing day, new ones were being constructed around Serbia. Most Serbs chafed under their deepening isolation, but a sense of national martyrdom and the refusal to turn over two  alleged war criminals converged to keep Serbia on Europe's doorstep, a festering trouble spot for the continent. The European Union made clear that impoverished Serbia would be kept in penury as long as its government refused to make a serious effort to arrest former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his top general, Ratko Mladic, the men accused of authorizing the executions of thousands of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. But with the dramatic capture of Karadzic, who investigators said Tuesday had hid in plain view for years in Belgrade, the door to Europe may have begun to swing open for Serbia. When he was grabbed on a Belgrade bus, the 63-year-old Karadzic looked more like a Balkan Santa Claus than the former leader who had become Europe's most wanted man. His trademark shelf of silver hair was gone, replaced by a flowing white beard and long, silvery mane. Karadzic was arrested in what appears to have been a carefully planned operation. According to Serbian authorities, he had been practicing medicine in Belgrade under a false identity, attending public meetings, appearing on local television and even contributing articles on ""spirituality"" to a wellness magazine. He reportedly possessed fake documents and lived under the name Dragan Dabic, a guise that prosecutors said allowed him to walk freely around Belgrade. ""His false identity was very convincing,"" Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Tuesday in Belgrade. ""Even his landlords were unaware of his identity."" The arrest was hailed across Europe, which had demanded Karadzic and Mladic's arrests as a non-negotiable condition of Serbia's entry to the EU. ""We have waited for this for 13 years. Finally. Finally,"" French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said in Brussels. ""This is a very good thing for the rapprochement of Serbia with the European Union."" For much of the 1990s, Karadzic and Mladic were the face of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, crimes they are accused of committing in full view of the public while European governments sat by. Karadzic spoke of the ""necessity"" of subjecting the civilians of Sarajevo to a siege that lasted nearly four years, and of how his campaign to force Muslims and Croats from their homes in Bosnia was really doing them a favor. Mladic served as eager executioner. Darkest chapter The two are accused of writing the darkest chapter of recent European history in July 1995 when they orchestrated the execution of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, in an area supposedly protected by UN forces. That November, the two were indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague to face genocide charges. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Karadzic's arrest a ""historic moment."" ""The victims need to know: Massive human rights violations do not go unpunished,"" she said. Karadzic's political career crashed soon after Srebrenica with the signing of the Dayton peace agreements, which ousted him as leader of the Republika Srpska. He and Mladic had already been indicted by the war crimes tribunal. And thus they began their careers as fugitives. Karadzic was widely believed to have taken refuge in  monasteries in Bosnia and neighboring Montenegro. Despite the presence of thousands of NATO troops in Bosnia, and frequent reports of sightings of the bushy-haired leader and his red Mercedes sedan, he managed to elude capture. Mladic, meanwhile, lived relatively openly in Belgrade under the protection of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav leader who died in a Dutch jail cell in 2006 while standing trial himself for alleged war crimes. Mladic, 66, remains at large. He is believed to retain a support network of former Yugoslav soldiers, and taking him alive could be tricky. Among a shrinking core of extreme Serb nationalists, Karadzic and Mladic are still regarded as heroes. But the EU's refusal to consider Serbia for membership until it arrested the two most infamous war crimes suspects has gradually turned public opinion against them. When Boris Tadic, a pro-Western moderate, was re-elected president earlier this year on a promise to steer Serbia toward EU membership, the arrests of Karadzic and Mladic seemed increasingly likely. ""The parliamentary election opened the door -- and it showed that the public was ahead of the politicians,"" said Sonja Biserko of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia. ""Karadzic was a symbol of the Milosevic policy. [Former Serbian President and Prime Minister Vojislav] Kostunica was installed as someone who had to keep the same policies by other means. This is now the end. Karadzic is the end of these two epochs,"" she said. Tadic defeated a hard-line nationalist, Tomislav Nikolic, in a close election last February. He was not able to form a new government until early this month. Last Friday, the Cabinet replaced the head of the secret police; Karadzic's arrest followed. His lawyer said Karadzic was arrested Friday, but the government says the arrest came Monday night. Street protests His capture generated   protests in Belgrade, with police at one point clashing with about 200 nationalists who were demonstrating against the government. There was a lot of chatter, as well. Dragan Ilic, host of Belgrade Radio B92's top morning show, said the station was flooded with calls, including some from people who had seen Karadzic at local appearances and on Serbian television shows. ""Two girls called in and told me that he was very nice,"" Ilic said. ""He was calm and was a good lecturer."" He added that most of the talk was focused on the surprise elements of Karadzic's capture. No one quite expected the Bosnian Serb leader to be captured on a bus. And no one, Ilic said, expected him to ""look like Santa Claus."" Karadzic's next grand stage will be the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, where he will face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. If convicted, he would probably spend the rest of his life in prison. ---------- thundley@tribune.com cspolar@tribune.com Credit: By Tom Hundley and Christine Spolar, TRIBUNE REPORTERS Tom Hundley reported from Chicago and Chris Spolar from Barcelona.

276,420767915.xml,"      Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama received an effusive welcome Friday from French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative leader who has pointedly embraced the Bush administration but who declared at a news conference that his nation would be ""delighted"" if Obama were elected president and dropped plenty of hints that he would be as well. The French president greeted Obama on the steps of the Elysee Palace, the presidential residence, as he would a visiting foreign leader. And while careful to note that the U.S. presidential election is a matter for Americans to decide, he gushed over the bond he said Europeans felt with Obama at a news conference after the two politicians met. ""Barack Obama's adventure is an adventure that rings true in the hearts and minds of the French and of Europeans,"" Sarkozy said. Popularity a dilemma Obama's five-hour visit to France, where his only meeting was with Sarkozy, followed an outdoor rally in Berlin a day earlier that drew more than 200,000 to hear Obama deliver a call for strengthened commitments to the U.S.-European alliance. In Germany, the arrival and departure of his plane was covered live on television. The enthusiasm in Europe over Obama presents a political dilemma for some of the continent's leaders as they balance an interest in maintaining friendly relations with the Republican Bush administration and public opinion at home that polls show is highly supportive of Obama's candidacy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised objections to a later-discarded plan  for Obama to speak at the Brandenburg  Gate but greeted him with a wide smile, though she made no comments to the media. Likewise, popularity abroad can be a double-edged sword for an American politician like Obama, lest it arouse suspicion among voters at home. In fact, at the news conference, a French reporter asked Obama whether ""is it a good thing to be loved by the French in the United States,"" noting that greater popularity abroad did not appear to help Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004. Obama deflected the question, saying that the ""average American has a great fondness for the French people."" Limited benefit David Axelrod, Obama's chief political strategist, said  signs of potential for building strong relations with foreign leaders were probably a net political plus, but only up to a point. ""I think it's helpful to see a spirit of cooperation. But, obviously, Americans are going to determine the outcome of the American election,"" said Axelrod, who has accompanied Obama for most of his foreign tour. Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian Jewish immigrant father whose parentage marks him as a barrier-breaker in French politics, showed no reservations about how to receive Obama. Sarkozy wished Obama ""good luck"" with his candidacy. And, despite his close relationship with the Bush administration, he seemed to suggest that Obama in the White House would be an improvement, calling ""very attractive"" the possibility of ""an America that would set as a priority being sensitive to and listening to the concerns of our friends."" At one point he recalled a meeting he had with Obama in  the Democrat's Senate office in 2006, shortly before Sarkozy was elected president of France. ""One of us became president. Well, let the other do likewise, huh? I mean, that's not meddling,"" Sarkozy said. Obama canceled a visit with wounded troops at Ramstein Air Base  in Germany planned for earlier in the day, drawing criticism from Republican rival John McCain. Obama communications director Robert Gibbs said the Illinois senator canceled the visit after the Pentagon raised concerns Wednesday evening that it could be viewed as a campaign event. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Defense Department had not tried to dissuade Obama from the visit but that it had made clear that the Pentagon was squeamish about the possibility of wounded soldiers being used for campaign purposes. ---------- mdorning@tribune.com Credit: By Mike Dorning, TRIBUNE CORRESPONDENT Aamer Madhani contributed from Chicago.

277,2045209520.xml,"Conservative, leftist head to contentious Colombia runoff BOGOTA, Colombia -- The conservative protege of a powerful former president and a leftist former guerrilla who has galvanized voters with an anti-establishment message are headed for what promises to be a polarizing presidential runoff after gaining the most votes in Sunday's election.With almost all quick-count results in, former senator Ivan Duque was leading with 39 percent of the ballots cast, short of the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a June runoff. One-time rebel and ex-Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro trailed in second place with 25 percent, edging out former Medellin Mayor Sergio Fajardo, who garnered nearly 24 percent.Duque and Petro represent opposite ends of Colombia's political spectrum and have presented dramatically different visions for the future of the Andean nation as it moves forward with a historic peace process with leftist rebels.Duque is the handpicked candidate of Alvaro Uribe, the ex-president and chief critic of the nation's 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. He is promising to amend aspects of the accord like ensuring that drug trafficking is not an amnestied crime and blocking guerrilla leaders from political office.Petro supports the accord and has galvanized youth voters angered by deeply entrenched corruption and income inequality. He is vowing to end Colombia's dependence on oil exports and raise taxes on vast swaths of unproductive land in hopes of boosting agricultural production. Critics have warned his rise could push Colombia toward the left and rattle markets. New bout of heavy fighting in Yemen kills 150 in four daysSANAA, Yemen -- Heavy fighting in Yemen between pro-government forces and Shiite rebels has killed more than 150 people in the last four days, Yemeni officials and witnesses said Sunday.Government forces have been trying to seize rebel-held areas along the western coast, while an allied Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the rebels with airstrikes in the northwestern Saada provinceThe offensive is being waged by ground troops carrying sophisticated weapons, including shoulder-fired missiles, with air cover from the coalition, the officials said.Security officials say a Saudi-led airstrike near a gas station in the capital, Sanaa, killed four civilians Saturday and wounded 10.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media 5,000 nationalists in Berlin met by 25,000 counter-protestersBERLIN -- Supporters of the nationalist Alternative for Germany party marched through central Berlin to protest against Chancellor Angela Merkel's government Sunday and were kept away from counter-demonstrations by a police.Police said over 5,000 people turned out for the demonstration organized by the anti-migration Alternative for Germany, known by its acronym AfD. A variety of counter-protests against the far right attracted well over 25,000 people, they said.The AfD event opened with German flags, placards such as ""No Islam in Germany"" and chants of ""Merkel must go"" outside Berlin's central train station. The party's supporters then marched to the landmark Brandenburg Gate. Opponents chanted ""Nazis out"" from the other side of the monument. With a roar, flash flood smashes into a Maryland communityELLICOTT CITY, Md. -- Roaring flash floods on Sunday struck a Maryland city that had been wracked by similar devastation two years ago, its main street turned into a raging river that reached the first floor of some buildings and swept away parked cars, authorities and witnesses said.News outlets showed photos and video of sudden, violent floodwaters surging down Main Street in Ellicott City, some 13 miles west of Baltimore. The community, set along the west bank of Maryland's Patapsco River, was also stricken by deadly flash flooding in July 2016.This time, witnesses said, the flash flooding came with a roar of onrushing water after hours of heavy rain had soaked the region around Baltimore. Emergency officials had no immediate reports of fatalities. Italy PM-designate ends bid to form governmentROME -- Italy's political landscape grew even shakier Sunday after the president refused to approve a proposed Cabinet minister with views critical of the euro currency, and the prime minister-designate quit his bid to form a populist coalition government.After emerging from the presidential palace, Prime Minister-Designate Giuseppe Conte did not say why he couldn't form Western Europe's first populist government.But Italian President Sergio Mattarella told the nation minutes later he had refused to accept the nominee the euroskeptic League and 5-Star Movement parties had put forward as economy minister.League leader Matteo Salvini had virtually given an ultimatum over the economy minister pick to Mattarella, whose duties as head of state include sanctioning a new Cabinet. H.W. Bush hospitalized for low blood pressureBIDDEFORD, Maine -- Former President George H.W. Bush was hospitalized Sunday in Maine after he experienced low blood pressure and fatigue, a spokesman said.Just after 2 p.m., Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the 93-year-old Bush, said he was awake, alert and not in any discomfort.He said Bush would spend at least a few days in the hospital for observation.Bush was taken to Southern Maine Health Care in Biddeford. A spokeswoman said Sunday all information would be released by the Bush family.Bush arrived in Maine for the summer May 20.On Saturday, Bush attended a pancake breakfast at an American Legion post in Kennebunkport. He had been scheduled to attend a Memorial Day parade in the town Monday. Florida authorities say a woman who was beaten and held captive for two days at gunpoint by her boyfriend escaped when she convinced him to bring their dog to an animal hospital -- and then slipped a note to a staff member. The suspect is being held without bond on domestic violence and other charges. Another person has died in Congo of a confirmed case of Ebola, bringing the number of fatalities from the latest outbreak to 12, the country's health ministry said Sunday. There are also four new suspected cases in the province, the statement reported.

278,2444916077.xml,"QAnon is a sprawling internet conspiracy theory as ugly as it is unfathomable. It weaves together anti-government fever dreams into an absurd narrative that portrays President Donald Trump as waging a secret battle against Satan-worshiping pedophiles who run a global child sex-trafficking ring. Allegedly Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and the Dalai Lama may somehow be in on it. (They’re not.)
The QAnon theory centers in part on the discredited notion that there is a “deep state” anti-Trump cabal within the U.S. government. QAnon has links to an earlier loony tale known as “Pizzagate,” which claimed a Washington, D.C., pizzeria was the headquarters of a sex trafficking ring involving Clinton. Pizzagate compelled a North Carolina man to fire a rifle inside the restaurant in a misguided attempt to free imprisoned children, so there is danger connected to these hoaxes.
Ideally, Illinois voters could spend their lifetimes never hearing about this except that QAnon talk is spreading this election season, and two Chicago-area Republicans seeking U.S. House seats have promoted the movement on social media and declined to denounce it. Philanise White of Chicago, running against Rep. Bobby Rush in the 1st Congressional District, and Theresa Raborn of Midlothian, running against Rep. Robin Kelly in the 2nd Congressional District, both have promoted QAnon by tweeting a recognized QAnon slogan as a hashtag.
National news reports have identified White and Raborn as two of as many as a dozen Republicans running for Congress who have associated themselves with QAnon. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is expected to win a U.S. House seat from Georgia, said that Q, the mythical leader of QAnon, is a “patriot,” according to NPR. She has called the theory “something worth listening to and paying attention to.”
Like Taylor Greene and others, Trump has not condemned QAnon, which helps fan its notoriety. “I don’t know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate,” Trump said last month.
That’s a heck of a friendly statement by a president on a ludicrous theory that says North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un is a CIA puppet and German Chancellor Angela Merkel is Adolf Hitler’s granddaughter (she’s not).
Philanise White in 2019 tweeted the QAnon slogan #WWG1WGA, which stands for “Where we go one, we go all.” Since then she’s been listed in news report, including by Axios and Forbes.com, as citing QAnon. Given the chance to renounce QAnon, she’s opted against doing so. When we asked White’s campaign if the candidate supports the QAnon conspiracy theory or welcomes QAnon support of her campaign, White’s camp replied by email: “Why the interest in Q and/or QAnon over Blacks supporting President Trump? Q/QAnon has never come up as a concern of the constituents.”
Theresa Raborn tweeted a video of Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, in which Flynn recites the QAnon hashtag. Raborn said she retweeted the video because she comes from a military family and respects Flynn. She told The Washington Post she “could not definitively debunk or definitively confirm” the theory. When we asked Raborn if she supports QAnon, she had plenty to say, but nothing bad about its theories and adherents. “I’m not just going to tell someone they are crazy or a conspiracy theorist until I know for certain, and I just don’t have time to research it. The little bit I do know is there is Q and there’s people that take those posts and are trying to decipher it like it’s some coded thing. ... One tweet and all of a sudden I’m supposed to support it? I don’t really support it and I’m not going to make fun of it.”
White and Raborn must see some benefit in showing respect for QAnon. They secured their Republican nominations after running unopposed in primaries. The GOP in the Chicago area is so weak that it struggles to recruit and support viable candidates in many elections. That’s how the Republican Party ended up in the embarrassing position of having Arthur Jones, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist, running for Congress in 2018 in the 3rd Congressional District. Republicans didn’t realize who Jones was until it was too late to enlist another challenger. Jones ran again this year, but thankfully Mike Fricilone of Homer Glen, a worthy candidate, also entered the race and won. Fricilone will face Democrat Marie Newman in November.
One Illinois Republican speaking out on QAnon is Rep. Adam Kinzinger. “I think conspiracy theories are going to be the thing that destroys this country in the long term because they undermine faith in government,” he told CNN last month. Kinzinger wants Republican leaders to repudiate QAnon: “It’s fake. Condemn it, please guys,” he said.
That’s pretty simple political wisdom. It’s deeply concerning that White and Raborn cannot decipher the truth about conspiracies and won’t dissociate themselves from the movement. Voters: Don’t send hoax-stokers to the halls of Congress.

279,1535972541.xml,"       Chinese execute 13 over attacks in restive region BEIJING -- China executed 13 people Monday for ""terrorist attacks"" in the far western region of Xinjiang, state media said, while another three were sentenced to death for a lethal attack at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.     Xinjiang is the traditional home of Muslim Uighurs who speak a Turkic language, and China has blamed previous attacks on Islamist separatists it says seek to establish an independent state.     Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang have provoked unrest, something Beijing denies.     The 13 executed men were involved in attacks in different parts of Xinjiang, including one last June that killed 24 policemen and local residents, the official Xinhua News Agency said.     In the Tiananmen case, five people were killed and 40 hurt last October when a car plowed into a crowd in the square and burst into flames. Those killed included three people in the car.     According to Xinhua, three men who helped plan the attack were convicted of organizing and leading a terrorist group and endangering public security; they were given death sentences.     As well as the death sentences for that attack, another man was sentenced to life and four others received jail terms ranging from five to 20 years, Xinhua said.     Footage of the trial on state broadcaster China Central Television showed suspects in orange jumpsuits at a Xinjiang courthouse, with Uighur women in tears as they watched the proceedings.  Thai junta denies driving out immigrant laborers     Thailand's junta denied Monday it was pursuing a ""sweep and clean"" policy of driving out foreign workers illegally in the country despite mass departures by Cambodians since it took power last month.     The International Organization for Migration estimates more than 100,000 Cambodian men, women and children in Thailand illegally have fled amid fears of a crackdown since the May 22 coup. The military's ruling council insists Cambodians are leaving of their own accord.  Army names general to investigate Bergdahl     WASHINGTON -- The Army said Monday it had named a general to investigate the disappearance and capture of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a possible step toward a formal finding that he left his base without authorization.     Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl will investigate ""the facts and circumstances surrounding"" Bergdahl's capture in June 2009. Bergdahl was exchanged last month for five Taliban prisoners held at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay.  Pakistani jets target militants in N. Waziristan     MIRAN SHAH, Pakistan -- Pakistani fighter jets pounded North Waziristan on Monday, a day after the army announced the start of a full-scale drive to flush Islamist insurgents out of the volatile region bordering Afghanistan. Islamabad has deployed troops, artillery and aircraft.     The army said combat aircraft destroyed six hideouts in the Shawal sector of North Waziristan, home to some of Pakistan's most feared militants and al-Qaida commanders, early Monday.  22 slain in Nigeria attack; Boko Haram suspected     MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Gunmen killed at least 22 people at a village market in remote northeast Nigeria, a security official said Monday, in what was likely the latest attack by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram.     The attack on the village of Daku in Borno state started Sunday, the official said, when gunmen arrived in a military column and started shooting, a tactic similar to previous Boko Haram operations.

Clinton to Germans: U.S. needs woman at the top     BERLIN -- Hillary Rodham Clinton told a German magazine the U.S. should follow Germany, where Angela Merkel is chancellor, and have a woman in charge.     ""We are way behind you in Germany on this,"" the former secretary of state told Stern magazine in an interview to be published Wednesday. ""Of course I want the U.S.A. to have a woman leader soon as well and I will do all I can for that to happen, though I don't know yet if it will be me,"" she said.  Fraud alleged in Afghan presidential election     KABUL, Afghanistan -- Presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah said Monday his opponent's apparent million-vote lead in the second round of elections over the weekend was due to massive fraud.     Observers fear allegations of fraud on both sides could lead to a lengthy and paralyzing struggle for power along ethnic lines.     Abdullah is of mixed Pashtun and Tajik descent, but his base of support is ethnic Tajiks; rival Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai is a Pashtun, like President Hamid Karzai.  1 dead as twisters strike northeastern Nebraska     A swarm of tornadoes, some appearing two at a time, struck several farming communities in northeastern Nebraska on Monday, killing at least one person and injuring 16 others in the town of Pilger, officials said.

280,1356315299.xml,"       For many in this car-crazy nation, the freedom to hurtle down  the famed autobahn at 120 mph or more is an inalienable right. Germany is alone among industrial countries in allowing drivers to  decide for themselves how fast to race along the highway. So a  proposal this month to impose a speed limit of 75 mph has set off  an election-year battle that has some people questioning a basic  tenet of German identity.  The suggestion from a top opposition leader challenged Germans to  pick two popular obsessions -- safety and sustainability -- over  another: a seemingly primal need to catapult themselves across  their country's countryside.  On speed limits, ""the rest of the world has been doing it for a  long time,"" Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the Social Democratic  Party, told the Rheinische Post, adding that Germans should drive  slower for safety.  Traffic deaths have been dropping for years in Germany, but Gabriel  said they would drop faster if there were a speed limit.  His proposal, which revived a decades-old discussion in the  country, was quickly disowned by other senior members of his party,  although other Social Democrats and members of the Green party  lined up in support.  On 60 percent of Germany's autobahn, drivers are free to go as fast  as they wish, and German-made cars frequently shoot down the left  lane at 120 mph.  Elsewhere on the highways, usually in areas where traffic is  heavier or near cities, there are already speed limits of roughly  60 to 75 mph.  Opinion polls show Germans split over the idea, but the issue is so  sensitive that it is unlikely to be acted upon until after the  September balloting. Chancellor Angela Merkel opposes speed limits,  although she is never seen behind the wheel, unlike her Audi-loving  predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union  has a comfortable lead in the polls.  ""There won't be a general speed limit on Germany's highways under  my rule,"" Transportation Minister Peter Ramsauer said in a  statement.  Speed limits are deeply tied to Germany's postwar identity. Adolf  Hitler built up the country's highway network, but the Nazis  instituted a nationwide speed limit of 50 mph to conserve resources  after World War II started in 1939.  By 1953, with the country's postwar industrial boom underway, speed  limits for cars were eliminated altogether. They were later added  in cities and on some stretches of highway.  ""People think they have more freedom"" without the speed limits,  said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, a director of the Center Automotive  Research at the University of Duisburg at Essen. ""You could compare  it a little bit with the U.S. position of having guns.""  German opponents of speed limits say drivers are smart enough not  to go faster than is safe.  But some say that argument is absurd given that 387 people died in  accidents on the autobahn last year.

281,1434564269.xml,"       If Angela Merkel wins in German national elections Sunday, as expected, she will be on track to eclipse the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as Europe's longest-serving female head of government. That is not where the comparisons end. Throughout a campaign that has been hers to lose, Merkel has cemented her domestic reputation as an iron chancellor, from her policies toward the debt-ridden neighbors of southern Europe to the way she holds her hands.    Yes, her hands.    Merkel has a habit of resting her hands in front of her waist with her fingers and thumbs forming the shape of a diamond. It is a studied gesture, aimed at diminishing the somewhat awkward public appearance of this businesslike budget hawk.    In much the same way that Thatcher's trademark handbag became synonymous with her tough negotiating style, the Merkel diamond has come to symbolize a Germany that stands tough in its insistence on preserving the European Union through painful but necessary reforms.    The EU is only beginning to recover from its debt crisis. It badly needs an adult in charge, to ensure that fiscal medicine will be taken in the prescribed dose. To date, Merkel has been the strict parent of Europe, living up to her domestic nickname, ""Mutti"" -- the German equivalent of ""Mommy.""    She is resented, especially in Greece, where she demanded budget cuts and debt restructuring that has led to six years of recession and widespread joblessness. The larger nations of Italy and Spain still are in danger of failing to carry out promised reforms.    A strong Merkel at the head of Europe's biggest economy will discourage backsliding by the weakest nations. She will insist on an end to overspending as the price of any future debt forgiveness. She will push through the unified banking regulation that Europe needs to head off a future crisis, as well as a political union enabling Brussels to impose budget restraint on any EU member tempted to re-enact the borrowing binge of the previous decade.    Merkel is needed to see these policies through, to reduce the economic risks that the weakest nations pose for the Europe, the U.S., the rest of the world.    We are rooting for her as Germans take to the polls Sunday. Despite her personal popularity, her political coalition is in peril.    Germans do not directly elect their chancellor. Rather, parties compete for votes. Polls show Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party in the lead with support from about 40 percent of Germans, but its current coalition partner, the business-friendly Free Democratic Party, is tanking. Merkel could be forced into a grand coalition with Germany's second-biggest party, the more liberal Social Democrats.    That could make it more difficult for Merkel to continue her sensible stand against no-strings-attached bailouts for southern Europe.    Merkel knows what is necessary to rebuild Europe's economic foundation. She grew up in economically crippled East Germany and witnessed the trauma there as it reunited with West Germany. She knows firsthand that for Europe to prosper, debt must be reduced to sustainable levels. Coming to the aid of indebted countries only makes sense, she acknowledged in an interview, ""if things are better afterward, not even more difficult.""    Thatcher understood that. The Britain that Thatcher took over resembled southern Europe today: mired in debt, unemployment and government dysfunction. It took a big handbag to straighten out that mess.    Merkel's party capitalized on her popularity in this campaign by using a close-up photo of her diamond hand gesture on a massive billboard at Berlin's central railway station. The sign reads, ""Germany's future in good hands.""    The gesture suggests genteel confidence and poise. Perhaps it would have been startling to see on a campaign billboard, but we'd suggest one of the attributes of Angela Merkel is that she understands when a hand must be coiled into a fist.

282,2259248343.xml,"When German Chancellor Angela Merkel was filmed shaking at an official ceremony in early June, her office brushed it off as an episode of dehydration. Then it happened again. And again. And last week, when she opted to sit through the national anthem during an official visit with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she was filmed trembling in her seat. After the event, she told journalists that she is fine, but ""will have to live with it for a while.""The episodes have left questions swirling in Germany, where for more than a decade, she earned respect among Germans for her stamina. She was credited for regularly negotiating with her counterparts from around the world until deep into the night, often pushing them to the brink of exhaustion. Merkel herself usually appeared to be wide-awake the next morning.Many Germans were taken aback by the recent shaking episodes because the images they saw were so inherently different from the way the chancellor had presented herself since she was first elected in 2005. To them, the incidents revealed the ""weakness of a strong woman,"" as conservative German weekly Focus wrote, and they resurfaced the question of who will eventually succeed her. Merkel has said she will not run for chancellor again when her term ends in 2021.After a weak performance in the 2017 elections, Merkel had found herself under mounting pressure to step aside. Among voters, Merkel remains Germany's most popular politician. But critics have seized upon these recent shaking incidents, and her office's choice not to expand on her medical details, as a new opportunity to lash out at a leader who they have previously accused of failing to be forthright about her politics and biography.It remains unclear how medically serious Merkel's shaking incidents have been. But globally, her office is far from the first to keep private details of a leader's medical history, often to avoid rumors they are unfit for office or perceptions they are too weak or vulnerable for their positions.A number of American leaders and high-profile politicians have chosen to keep their medical conditions out of the public eye. On the campaign trail in 2016, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton fell ill at an event honoring victims of the 9/11 attacks and had to depart earlier than planned. An onlooker captured video that appeared to show her legs buckling as Secret Service agents helped her into her van. The campaign said she was dehydrated, and later expanded to clarify that she had recently been diagnosed with pneumonia after a long allergy-related coughing spell. Her somewhat mild illness came after months of accusations from her Republican competition that she was suffering from an undisclosed illness.She later told CNN that she kept the diagnosis private and tried to power through because she ""just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal.""Indeed, other leaders have hidden far more serious medical conditions from the public -- often for years at a time.Decades after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, new medical files revealed that he was taking a wide range of medications previously unknown to the public, including hormones and painkillers. It was common knowledge that Kennedy had back pain, but these files showed that he had also been diagnosed with Addison's disease, a disorder in which one's adrenal glands don't produce enough hormones, the files revealed.The disease is often developed after a bout of tuberculosis, so when there was public speculation that he was afflicted by the condition while he was alive, his aides carefully released a statement denying that he had tuberculosis-induced Addison's disease. That wouldn't rule out the possibility that he had developed Addison's through different means.Eight months after Francois Mitterand left France's presidency, he died from prostate cancer in 1996. His personal doctor, Claude Gubler, said Mitterand had successfully hidden his illness from the public for years.The revelations sparked outrage in France among those who saw Gubler's publication of personal medical details as a violation of strict privacy laws. But the reports were especially dramatic because Mitterand had pledged to publicize honest medical updates each six months to avoid any surprises, like when French President Georges Pompidou died in office in 1974, having never revealed that he was suffering from late-stage cancer.Other French leaders have kept their illnesses private. In 2013, French President Francois Hollande acknowledged that he underwent prostate surgery in 2011, shortly before he announced his run for the presidency. He didn't publicize his medical condition, which was described as benign prostate swelling, until after he was elected.CAPTION: Photo: Angela Merkel has kept some recent health issues private causing detractors to lash out.

283,1533631537.xml,"       After snubbing the Russian leader earlier in the week, President  Barack Obama met briefly with Russian President Vladimir Putin on  Friday for the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders  since the crisis in Ukraine sent their already rocky relationship  into a spiral. At the secluded Chateau de Benouville, the countryside estate where  a coterie of world leaders, kings and Queen Elizabeth II broke from  a public program of D-Day ceremonies for lunch, Obama and Putin  talked as they huddled by a doorway.     The meeting Friday was brief and unscripted, the White House said,  lasting about 15 minutes after a lunch hosted by French President  Francois Hollande. But it marked another twist in the drama-filled  relationship between two leaders with no love lost and no way to  work around the other.     According to Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser,  Obama urged Putin to recognize the newly elected president of  Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, as the legitimate leader, ""ceasing  support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and stopping the  provision of arms and materiel across the border.""     Rhodes said Obama ""made clear that a failure to take these steps  would only deepen Russia's isolation.""     TV footage of the pair talking suggested Putin appeared to  interrupt Obama at times, although it's unclear what he said.     Just before they met, Putin was seen talking to Poroshenko at the  lunch. The two leaders spoke briefly, standing on each side of  German Chancellor Angela Merkel.     Officials later said Putin and Poroshenko discussed arranging a  formal cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where gunbattles between  government supporters and Russian-backed separatists have claimed  dozens of lives, as well as other steps to ease tensions in a  crisis that first erupted in March when Russian forces seized the  Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine. ""They spoke out in favor of the  soonest stop to the bloodshed ... and also of the cessation of  hostilities,"" Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told ITAR-Tass, a  Russian news service.     A Poroshenko spokeswoman, Irina Friz, gave further details on her  Facebook page. She said negotiations would start Sunday for a plan  to take joint action to ""prevent constant Ukrainian border crossing  by Russian militants,"" among other goals.     A senior Obama administration official, who briefed reporters later  on condition he not be identified, called the discussion ""a  positive development"" but not a substitute for Putin formally  recognizing Poroshenko's election.     The official said Ukraine's election ""provided for a new basis of  legitimacy for the government. It provides a new interlocutor"" for  Putin. ""There is a window open here.""     U.S. and European leaders initially vowed to isolate Russia  politically and economically -- hoping that sanctions and other  pressure would persuade Putin to stop aiding separatists in other  parts of eastern Ukraine.     Now, with Putin pulling troops off the Ukrainian border and a newly  elected leadership in Kiev, White House officials say they're no  longer trying to ramp up pressure but are working at persuading  Putin to take other steps.     That requires engaging with Putin. Even as the U.S. and Europeans  shut Putin out of the G-7 summit Thursday in Brussels, Obama  watched three of his closest allies -- France's Hollande, Germany's  Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron -- book their own  private session with the Russian leader.     Publicly, Obama and Putin showed no signs of warmth under the  watchful eyes of reporters Friday, as they were corralled with the  rest of leaders for a group photo at the neoclassical estate that  once harbored French resistance fighters.     They either kept at a distance -- busy talking to others -- or  ignored each other when in close range. Obama spent time seeing to  the 88-year-old queen.

284,1901653938.xml,"How objective can even the upright (special counsel Robert) Mueller  be about the conduct of an old colleague, (James Comey,) part of  the same FBI club? How likely is Mr. Mueller to evaluate  objectively the president who unceremoniously fired that associate  and friend? The same question applies to the actions of current and  former FBI and Justice Department officials -- which need to be  investigated. At this point, the only crime shown in the entire  Russia investigation is the leaking of classified information,  particularly Mike Flynn's name from surveillance transcripts. Given  the FBI's ability to unmask such names, along with its outsize role  in the Russia investigation, there is a good chance some of the  unauthorized (and potentially felonious) leaks came from inside the  bureau Mr. Mueller used to lead, possibly from people he worked  with. ...  Mr. Mueller's past employment and his association with Mr. Comey  are not in and of themselves disqualifying. But they do put a  significant burden on the special counsel to prove that he will  look as closely at his old shops as he does at the new  administration.-- Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal Malte Lehming, a columnist for the Berlin daily Tagesspiegel,  didn't mince his words: ""(Angela) Merkel is a magician."" He was  referring not only to her party's smashing victory in a state  election in North Rhine?Westphalia ... but to her overall  political prowess.The elections and the mood of the country suggest once more just  how fundamentally conservative it remains. ... Merkel, who stands  for everything and nothing, the all-knowing Mutti, or Mother, as  she is known, is on the verge of a win that will seal her place in  history as one of Germany's most influential chancellors. She will  likely use Germany's economic clout to reinvigorate the  Franco-German relationship, box out Britain and ultimately reshape  Europe, as far as possible, in Germany's image.

285,1989493287.xml,"Angela Merkel's would-be partner in a new German government voted narrowly to continue talks with her center-right party on Sunday, meaning resolution could be within reach following four months of political gridlock.  The vote by a convention of the center-left Social Democrats, known by the acronym SPD, marked the clearing of a key hurdle in the creation of a governing coalition following inconclusive September elections. It came after party leaders faced down a vocal and energetic insurgency from members who wanted to abandon the talks.Opponents of a deal say past agreements with Merkel have diluted the party's identity and eroded its appeal, as was reflected in the SPD's dismal 20 percent of the vote in September -- its worst showing in postwar history.Proponents argued that the party had little choice, with a breakdown in talks likely to trigger a new election in which the SPD -- Germany's oldest party -- could expect even more severe punishment from voters.The split was reflected in a tight vote after a day of impassioned speeches in the old West German capital of Bonn. Of 641 delegates, 56 percent voted to proceed with the talks, which have already yielded a preliminary agreement.The vote clears the way for formal negotiations to kick off as Merkel's conservative bloc and the SPD haggle over policies and control of key ministries. A final deal will need the approval of rank-and-file Social Democratic voters, though many analysts saw Sunday's vote of party officials and activists as the more serious potential obstacle to agreement.A so-called grand coalition government featuring the country's two historically dominant parties could be in place by April.CAPTION: Photo: The SPD voted Sunday to discuss forming a coalition with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc.

286,420362619.xml,"      FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS' ISSUE    One world ... many stories    The Chicago Tribune is one of a handful of American newspapers that field their own foreign correspondents to bring readers first-hand reports from around the world. Travel the globe with our correspondents as they analyze their regions and explore the stories they will be following for you in 2006.    In late May and early June, word on the street was ""non"" and ""nee.""    Voters in France and the Netherlands seemed to speak for Europe's silent majority when they rejected a proposed European constitution.    The ""no"" vote came from many quarters: social democrats who feared the new constitution would end Europe's well-endowed welfare state, Catholic nationalists angry that the document made no mention of God, and far-right-camp followers of Jean-Marie Le Pen and Geert Wilders who believed that a ""no"" vote would keep Turkey out of the European Union and stanch the tide of Muslim immigration to Europe.    The news media called the result an earthquake. Political analysts described it as the end of the European ideal of multiculturalism.    It would get worse.    A month later, Britain's first homegrown terrorist cell targeted the London public transit system and murdered 52 rush-hour commuters in a suicide attack.    Mohammed Sidique Khan, the ringleader of the cell, videotaped a suicide message, but it wasn't his empty rant about jihad that chilled Britons, it was his ""born and bred"" West Yorkshire accent.    Fast-forward to late October and November and the riots that swept across the cities of France. Out-of-work young men, the French- born sons of North African immigrants, vented their rage in a three- week orgy of violence and vandalism. In 20 nights of rioting they burned nearly 9,000 cars.    The thread that links these events is that all are part of the great European debate on multiculturalism. As Europe's economies become increasingly integrated, its people--particularly its large immigrant communities--are becoming less so. It is a debate that will continue to dominate the European political stage in 2006.    In the 1960s, Roy Jenkins, the British politician and biographer, defined multiculturalism ""not as a flattening process of assimilation, but as equal opportunity, accompanied by cultural diversity, in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance."" On paper, it seemed like a good approach for Europe; the reality proved much harder to achieve.    The Dutch tried as hard as anyone. But the Netherlands is a small nation, and now there is a real fear that the country's liberal values are in danger of being swamped by a flood of immigrants from Muslim countries. The fear has given a boost to far-right politicians not only in the Netherlands but also places like Denmark and Belgium.    Even the large nations of Europe are having trouble coming to terms with minorities and multiculturalism. Germans can't seem to accept the idea that someone born in Germany and named Ahmed can be truly German, and the French voted ""no"" on the EU constitution based on unsubstantiated fears that the country was about to be overrun by an army of ""Polish plumbers.""    In 2006 the debate is likely to shift back to the Balkans, where the breakup of the former Yugoslavia -- Europe's last truly multicultural state--continues with Montenegro and Kosovo expected to bid for independence from the awkward entity now known as Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegrins could hold a referendum on the question as early as April; UN-led talks on Kosovo's status are already under way.    The 2 million ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population detest being ruled by Belgrade, but the 100,000 Serbs still living in the province are justifiably fearful of being ruled by the Albanians.    The only good news is that Belgrade, eager to strengthen its hand at the bargaining table, suddenly seems serious about tracking down and delivering former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.    The gradual changing of the political guard will gather pace in 2006. Although it wasn't obvious at the time, the French ""no"" vote on the EU constitution effectively ended Jacques Chirac's run as a dominant player on the European stage. He was nearly invisible during the autumn rioting.    The French presidential election won't take place until 2007, but the spotlight already is on the rivalry between the suave prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, and the feisty interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy.    In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair is fast approaching his political sell-by date. He insists he will serve a full term, until 2009, and he probably will, but increasingly the focus is on Blair's designated heir, Gordon Brown, and the Conservative Party's startlingly young new leader, David Cameron, who turns 40 this year.    Meanwhile, Angela Merkel, Germany's first female chancellor, is poised to restore her country's primacy in European affairs. Already, signs of reform in the German economy are starting to lift economic forecasts for the rest of Europe.    In June, Germany will attempt to showcase the virtues of multiculturalism when it hosts soccer's World Cup, the quadrennial championship of the planet's most popular sport.    The question is whether Germany's 1.9 million Turks will cheer as enthusiastically for Germany's team as they would have for Turkey, which failed to qualify.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTO; Caption: PHOTO: Tom Hundley covered last year's voting on the European constitution, rioting in France, terror attacks in Britain and political developments in Germany.

287,1979952957.xml,"Every December, I ask readers to help me predict the news events of the coming year, and 12 months later I come back for a look at how their predictions and mine matched up against actual events.
I’ll spare you the suspense. After my narrow victory in 2016, the plurality predictions of the hive mind killed me in 2017, with a 62 percent accuracy rate against my 44 percent.
On only 10 predictions out of 34 — most of them fairly easy — readers and I were correct. We said that …
• Democratic Rep. Michael Madigan would be re-elected as Illinois House speaker.
• Democrats would not select U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota to be their national chairman (they chose Tom Perez).
• President Donald Trump’s job approval number in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll in mid-December 2017 would be under 40 percent (it’s hovering around 35 percent).
• Congress would not approve substantial funding for a new wall at the Mexican border.
• The Trump Justice Department would not launch a “lock her up!” effort to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
• The U.S. gross domestic product would grow at a rate of from 2 to 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2017 (the reported estimate was 3.3 percent, compared to 3.5 for the third quarter of President Barack Obama’s last full year in office).
• President Trump would not block commercial flights from the U.S. to Cuba.
• The U.S. would not withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal (though Trump is strongly signaling that we will soon).
• The White Sox would not make the postseason.
• The Blackhawks would not win the Stanley Cup.
Eleven times, readers were right and I was wrong. I foolishly disagreed when they said that …
• Someone other than Jay Cutler and Matt Barkley (remember him?) would start the season as quarterback for the Bears. (It was Mike Glennon, remember him?)
• President Trump would move to block federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities.
• Trump would bail out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP).
• There would be more than 500 homicides in Chicago (we are already over 650 but thankfully not on pace to exceed the 2016 total of 792)
• Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel would not fire police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.
• The U.S. Senate would confirm President Trump’s first pick for the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.
• Right-wing firebrand Marine Le Pen would lose the French presidential election.
• Incumbent German Chancellor Angela Merkel would win re-election.
• The Cubs would not repeat as World Series champions.
• Trevor Noah would still be the host of “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central.
• Fred Hoiberg would still be the coach of the Bulls.
In only five instances was I right and readers wrong. They disagreed with my guesses that …
• Republicans would fail in their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
• One of Trump’s Cabinet nominees would fail to be seated (Labor secretary candidate Andrew Pudzer withdrew).
• Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett would get a prison sentence of from four to seven years (she got 4 1/2; readers thought it would be seven to nine years).
• U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock of Peoria, charged for misuse of funds, would still be awaiting trial.
• The U.S. would not suffer a terrorist attack in 2017 worse than the June 12, 2016, attack on an Orlando nightclub in which 49 people were killed.
The last one is debatable. I didn’t count the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 58 dead as a terrorist act, because the gunman’s motive remains unclear and seems unrelated to foreign or domestic terror efforts.
And eight times, readers and I were both wrong when we predicted that …
• The Dow Jones Industrial Average would be lower than 22,500 (it’s well over 24,000 at this writing).
• The state budget stalemate would not end.
• The unemployment rate would rise to 4.7 percent or higher by November 2017 (it was 4.1 percent).
• 2017 would be another global warmest-year-on-record. Experts say it will fall just short of the 2016 record.
• J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy would not both run for governor.
• The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide would be higher than $2.75 (it’s roughly $2.42).
• Alabama would win the college football crown (it was Clemson).
• Bears coach John Fox would be fired.
Technically, our record will improve slightly if Fox is given his inevitable walking papers before Jan. 1, but due to deadlines, these predictions have always been based on a year ending just before Christmas.
Given this record of futility, the question comes up: Why do this? Why try to look ahead through the fog when a monkey with a dart board could do just as well?
Because making and later reviewing predictions is simply another way of planting a flag in the present — of taking note of the puzzles that now concern us and looking back with humility at how life has confounded us.
Now, for instance, many of us are wondering if the Democrats will retake one or both chambers of Congress in the November elections, if the soaring stock market will come back to earth in 2018 and who else will be indicted in the probe of Russian interference into the 2016 election.
We’re wondering if Congress will protect the “Dreamers,” if the U.S. will take military action against North Korea and if the U.S. Supreme Court will allow bakers to refuse to sell wedding cakes to gay couples.
We’re wondering where President Trump’s job-approval number will be in 12 months, or if he will even still be in office.
We’re wondering who’s going to win the gubernatorial election in Illinois and if Republicans can flip the state House and seize the speaker’s gavel from Michael Madigan.
We’re wondering who’s going to throw a hat in the ring to challenge Mayor Rahm Emanuel in the February 2019 election.
I have my hunches on these and other questions, and you probably do too. Go here to fill out the 2018 Predict The News Survey. I'll compare your collective forecasts with mine in my Jan. 7 column.

288,1465504597.xml,"       Vladimir Putin regularly buffs up his strongman image by stripping off his shirt for photographers while he hunts, casts for fish and rides horses. You have to wonder: Does he strip off his shirt each time he picks up the phone to bully the president of Ukraine? Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, stunned European Union negotiators last month when he abruptly rejected a trade and integration deal with the EU just days before it was to be finalized. Yanukovych did so a few weeks after he flew to a military base near Moscow for a secret meeting with Russian President Putin, who fiercely opposes Ukraine's tilt toward Europe.  The obvious implication: Putin put on the hard squeeze and Yanukovych wilted.  That has prompted angry protests from Ukrainian citizens and opposition leaders. Yanukovych has answered with riot police, leading to violent clashes in the streets of Kiev, Ukraine's capital. Demonstrators have been beaten. Yanukovych has threatened to crack down even harder if pro-Europe protests continue.  Putin has leverage here. Ukraine is heavily in debt to Moscow and depends on it for natural gas and trade. When Putin banned imports of Ukrainian chocolate, candy and cake this summer on a flimsy pretext, those products piled up at the border. Putin's priority is to force his neighbors, especially the large and populous Ukraine, into a proposed new customs union under Russia's control.  Yanukovych has much to gain in the short term from a deal with Putin, including cheaper gas, financial relief and lucrative business contracts for his cronies, who have benefited in the past from collaboration with Moscow. A temporary boost for Ukraine's failing economy would help Yanukovych's 2015 re-election campaign. Ukraine is in a fragile state: mired in debt, short of hard currency. Putin could clobber it by imposing trade sanctions and crimping the gas supply.  The EU offers short-term pain and long-term gain. The deal Ukraine almost signed would have brought fiscal discipline and political accountability -- which Ukraine desperately needs -- and the opportunity to integrate with the world's largest trading union. Given its agricultural resources, Ukraine could be an economic star: Arable land makes up more than half the country, which is traditionally known as the breadbasket of Europe. Much like the American Midwest -- and precious few other places in the world -- the soil is rich, dark, deep and expansive.  Yet agricultural production is inefficient. Until recently, foreign investment was practically prohibited. Reform is badly needed if Ukraine is to obtain the investment capital to realize its potential. Tilting toward the authoritarian Putin is no way to accomplish that goal.  There is a difficult history here. As a part of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine suffered hardships. Since the Soviet breakup two decades ago, Ukraine has struggled to embrace democratic institutions, establish the rule of law and find its economic footing. The EU deal was viewed, especially in the western region of Ukraine, as an opportunity to remake a promising but backward land.  Politics in Ukraine is rough-and-tumble: Yanukovych's top rival, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, an architect of Kiev's pro-Democracy Orange Revolution in 2004, is jailed on charges that she abused her power. Her allies, and many outside of Ukraine, believe the charges are politically motivated. EU leaders, most significantly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have pressed for her release.  Ukraine, by geography and economic sphere, is vulnerable to Putin's threats. The EU path promises some difficulty, but ultimately a strong foundation for prosperity. This is a critical decision. The U.S. and its European allies should step up with more support for Ukraine.  If Yanukovych puts his people first, he'll tell Putin to take a hike -- clothing optional.

289,1011389405.xml,"      Sunday's elections in France and Greece provided a jolting confirmation of some old verities. Such as: When times are bad, incumbents get blamed. Voters hate being deprived of goodies they have long taken for granted. Economic turmoil fosters political upheaval. The campaign outcomes may not be a surprise, but they make it plain how difficult it will be to achieve the changes many countries in the eurozone badly need. Fiscal austerity isn't popular when economies are booming, and it's even harder to swallow when they are struggling. Both the French and Greek economies are doing just that lately. In France, output growth is barely moving, and unemployment is at 10 percent. But the Greeks would happily trade places: Their GDP is in free fall, and the jobless rate is above 20 percent. No wonder voters were willing to evict French President Nicolas Sarkozy as well as the two main parties that have long dominated in Greece. In situations like this, the public rarely says, ""More of the same, please."" It's tempting to demand that things go back as they were when times were good. But that's not an option. Both France and Greece have been living far beyond their means, and they have run up hard against the inevitable limits of that approach. The government of Greece had to accept stringent austerity measures to secure a bailout it needed to avoid a disastrous default. France had its bonds downgraded, raising its borrowing costs, largely because its debt was out of control. The leaders who were defeated were trying to reform policies that their countries can't afford. Now the burden will fall on leaders who resist such changes without offering realistic alternatives. The incoming French president, Socialist Francois Hollande, has vowed to curb deficits, which would be more credible if he hadn't also promised to expand welfare benefits, reduce the retirement age and hire lots of new teachers. He wants changes in the eurozone's fiscal treaty that are anathema to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Greece's future is even less certain after the electorate turned to various small outof- power parties that oppose the austerity program--including a neo-Nazi faction. Forming a government will be hard, and finding broadly acceptable policies that will allow Greece to remain in the eurozone will be even harder. The immediate question is whether France and Greece will really refuse to make the changes needed to restore fiscal balance. The deeper question is whether Europe's monetary union can survive. Writes Matthew Yglesias in Slate, writes: ""European voters simply lack the sense of common identity and solidarity that are necessary for such a large and diverse place to share a single system of economic management."" Germany, historically allergic to inflation, is not willing to accept the sort of monetary easing that the Federal Reserve has employed in an effort to revive the U.S. economy. But that approach would provide a tonic to the economies of Greece and France, making the fiscal challenge less formidable. Easing would make more sense there than it does in the U.S., given the more dire economic situation in France and Greece. Beyond that, it's going to fall on Merkel to keep the leaders and people of France and Greece focused on the necessity of curbing fiscal excess and governmental indulgence. Her party had a rough time at the polls, too, on Sunday. But Germany has been more disciplined than its neighbors ... and has the strongest economy in Europe. Merkel's task is to remind everyone of the facts of economic life.

290,420757345.xml,"      JOHANNESBURG -- Amnesty International on Thursday reported that serious human rights abuses continue in Zimbabwe and criticized members of President Robert Mugabe's ruling party, saying they regard violence as a useful political tool. After a six-day trip to Zimbabwe, the rights group's secretary general, Irene Khan, dismissed the government's explanation that it lacked the funds to make improvements on human rights. ""Ending attacks on human rights defenders, lifting restrictions on the media and allowing public protests do not require more money. They only require political will,"" she said in a statement. ""Progress on human rights has been woefully slow."" Zimbabwe's government of national unity, formed in February to end an impasse over disputed elections last year, is hamstrung by the opposing political forces it contains. Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change, is pushing for reform. However, hard-liners in the security forces, still controlled by Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, are resisting. Activists are being arrested and white farmers are driven off their land, according to the report. The land is often given to Mugabe supporters. Khan said no serious efforts had been made to reform the police, army, intelligence and other security agencies, or to prosecute people responsible for last year's political violence. She said senior ministers told her that wasn't a priority right now. Her comments came as Tsvangirai toured Western nations, urging leaders to release the developmental aid needed to repair Zimbabwe's ruined infrastructure. The West has embraced him warmly, pointedly isolating Mugabe further. However, Tsvangirai has been promised only modest humanitarian assistance. President Barack Obama heaped lavish praise on Tsvangirai last week, citing the prime minister's courage and tenacity, but offered $73 million that will bypass the Zimbabwean government. German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised $35 million. The unity deal, crafted by regional leaders led by South Africa, left ZANU-PF hard-liners who control the security forces able to easily block reforms. Their political survival, analysts say, depends on the failure of the MDC and moderates in ZANU-PF who are willing to work with Tsvangirai's administration. Tsvangirai has argued that without significant Western assistance, the unity government has little hope of achieving reform. His government has promised to set up escrow accounts for foreign development aid, rather than plowing it directly into the national budget. But the prime minister's argument has not yet swayed most foreign donors. On Thursday, the European Union promised to restore ties with Zimbabwe, but only after political violence is reduced, media freedom is honored and security forces are brought under the control of the unity government. Amnesty International's report underscores Western concerns about the continuing power of spoilers in Mugabe's party. ""Persistent and serious human rights violations, combined with a failure to introduce reform of the police, army and security forces or address impunity and the lack of clear commitment on some parts of the government are real obstacles that need to be confronted by the leadership of Zimbabwe,"" said Khan said. McDonald Lewanika, spokesman for the Harare-based Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, a rights group, said it was premature to provide monetary support to the unity government. ""We are urging Western governments to give aid and deepen it, aid for humanitarian assistance and also the education and health sectors,"" he said. ""But when we begin to talk about aid beyond that, or direct budgetary support for this inclusive government, it becomes a different story. ""I think this inclusive government needs to be supported,"" Lewanika said. ""We feel that Western governments can promise this kind of support but allow it to be predicated on certain things, especially democratic progress."" ---------- Trafficking in humans?

291,419546983.xml,"         Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's days of coasting to the September elections are officially over as he struggles to turn the troubled German economy around with one hand and fight off Edmund Stoiber with the other.    Stoiber, the extremely conservative governor of Bavaria, was chosen by the Christian Democratic Union and its smaller sister party Friday to lead the opposition in national elections next fall.    Stoiber's success was an upset for the Christian Democrats' leader, Angela Merkel, who at 49 would have been the first woman to run for chancellor and was once considered the front-runner against Schroeder.    But Merkel has faltered as leader and has failed to stamp her authority on the party, which turned against her.    Stoiber, head of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, nudged her aside with his success as governor of Germany's most prosperous state and a pit-bull political personality that hopes to capitalize on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. with attacks on immigration and calls for tougher security.    ""I think Stoiber has the best chance of unseating Schroeder,"" said Johann Eekhoff, a professor at the Institute for Political Economists in Cologne. ""Stoiber couldn't offer a clearer choice.""    New year wake-up call    The chancellor rang in 2002 reading the sober results of recent opinion polls. German voters see the near-term economic future as grim, polls show, despite the euro's impressively smooth entry into the economy. The problem is that despite Schroeder's campaign promises in 1998 to stem rising unemployment, joblessness is at the politically charged high of four million people or close to 10 percent of the workforce.    And this September, leaving little time to act, Schroeder's Social Democrats-Greens center-left coalition faces the voters again. Stoiber has signaled that jobs will be his major campaign issue.    Germans long have feared that smaller economies it is tied to with a common currency, such as Italy and France, would pull it off its economic pedestal. But now it looks as if Germany could drag down its neighbors as the European Union's anchor nation feels the weight of recession, rising unemployment, bankruptcies and an export slump.    Germany off its stride    In 2001, Germany had the lowest growth rate of the 15 EU member states, and 2002 doesn't look much better, with projected growth of less than 1 percent.    Schroader, who once seemed unbeatable, is urgently taking stock of his economic and political strategy. Since Sept. 11, German blue chip companies such as Siemens, Dresdner bank and Deutsche bank have together laid off tens of thousands of people.    ""Schroeder is being squeezed to change his course, at least symbolically,"" said Hajo Funke, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University.    But Schroeder may need more than a slight change in tack.    ""At heart, Schroeder is an interventionist,"" said Eekhoff. ""What the opposition can offer is an economic policy that is closer to private market principles."" Stoiber, governor since 1993, has presided over the growth of a large high-tech sector in Bavaria.    Germany has become more, not less regulated, said Eekhoff--a point that the chancellor would challenge. But many critics in business and finance say that German labor regulations and its generous welfare system discourage the development of a low-wage sector that could encourage people off of welfare.    It is almost impossible to be fired in Germany.    The only way people will be able to get jobs, however, is if the government allows people to get laid off, according to economists such as Eekhoff, who prescribe an American-style boom and bust pattern that allows the quick absorption of large numbers of workers in an expanding economy and their easy dismissal during downturns.    ""We must have the possibility to lay off to make companies more profitable and change products,"" he said. ""It is necessary in a living economy.""    Unions on alert    That pattern runs against the basic social contract here and is opposed by the country's powerful trade unions, traditional supporters of Schroeder's Social Democrats. However it is possible that Schroeder could strike some kind of deal with the trade unions regarding low wage jobs. His modest target is 3.5 million unemployed.    It will be a difficult struggle for Schroeder to turn the economy around before the September election, however, as any reform would involve some major legislation in a parliament increasingly sensitive to the fall election.    Recent opinion polls still show that while a majority of voters support Schroeder, his numbers and the numbers for his coalition with the environmental Greens are slipping.    Unresponsive to slowdown    Schroeder has been criticized for not responding to the global slowdown last fall with an economic stimulus packages as the U.S. and Great Britain did.    ""You have to spend more money,"" said Funke, of Berlin's Free University. ""You don't have to be a Keynesian deficit spender to see this.""    But Schroeder's Finance Minister, Hans Eichel, also has to keep government debt to 3 percent of gross domestic product under strict rules governing the introduction of the euro.    The rule was introduced at Germany's insistence to rein in government spending in countries such as Greece and Italy that could have weakened the new currency. Germany is already touching the debt ceiling, limiting the government's policy options.

David Miranda, the partner of reporter Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian, was held for questioning at London's Heathrow Airport for nearly nine hours Sunday, the maximum allowed under Britain's Terrorism Act before a person must be released or arrested.    The Brazilian government issued a statement saying the detention of Miranda, who is a Brazilian national, was ""without justification.""    Senior politicians, human rights activists and an independent reviewer in Britain have also expressed alarm about the incident, according to British news reports.    Widney Brown of the London-based rights group Amnesty International told The Guardian that Miranda's detention was ""unlawful and inexcusable.""    ""There is simply no basis for believing that David Michael Miranda presents any threat whatsoever to the UK government,"" Brown was quoted as saying. ""The only possible intent behind this detention was to harass him ... for his role in analyzing the data released by Edward Snowden.""    Keith Vaz, chairman of the British Home Affairs parliamentary select committee, said he would ask the police to explain why terrorism legislation was used in a case that did not appear to be terrorism-related.  Merkel cancels campaign rallies after hostage-taking    Chancellor Angela Merkel canceled two election rallies in the southern German state of Bavaria on Monday after a 24-year-old man took three people hostage in Ingolstadt, one of the cities where she had been scheduled to speak.    Merkel was due to appear in Ingolstadt and Regensburg as part of a campaign tour.    The hostage-taking was ended shortly before 6 p.m., after nearly nine hours, when police special forces overwhelmed the hostage-taker, according to media reports.

293,420224394.xml,"      TRIBUNE PROFILE    Little more than a decade ago, in the clubby, male-dominated backrooms of Germany's Christian Democratic Union, people assumed Angela Merkel was one of the secretaries.    Her political mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, used to refer to her as mein maedchen--my girl--in a way that many an ambitious woman would have found chauvinistic or patronizing. Merkel just smiled.    When she began her political ascent, rivals and critics mocked her frumpy outfits and utilitarian hairstyle. Newspapers seemed to take cruel delight in running the least flattering photos of her. But she turned the mockery to her advantage. She forced them to deal with her as a politician of substance, not a ""female politician."" Her ideas, not her hairstyle, would be the subject of the conversation.    Merkel, 51, always kept her eye on the prize. Next month she is expected to claim it. If the polls hold, she will become Germany's first female chancellor, and the first to have come of age in the former communist East Germany.    But she is not quite home free.    Although it's unlikely, Germany's highest court could cancel or postpone the Sept. 18 vote if it finds that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder violated the law by calling for early elections. So far, Schroeder's gamble on early elections has backfired. The race has tightened, but his Social Democratic Party, or SPD, still trails the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, by a nearly hopeless 42 percent to 29 percent, thus virtually assuring Merkel the chancellorship. The problem for Merkel is that Schroeder remains the more popular politician by 48 percent to 39 percent.    Even within the CDU, Merkel is an awkward fit. The party's roots are in Germany's prosperous west; its conservative values are shaped by the Roman Catholic Church, and it has never before been led by a woman. Merkel, a former physicist from East Germany, is the daughter of a Lutheran minister. Her first marriage ended in divorce and she remarried in 1998; she has no children.    Because she is a female leader of Germany's conservatives, comparisons with Britain's Margaret Thatcher are inviting but misleading.    ""In some ways they are similar. Both are women, of course. Both started their careers in science, and that probably influences their way of thinking,"" said Jacqueline Boysen, who has written a biography of Merkel. ""But the main thing about Merkel is that she grew up in a dictatorship. She was 35 years old when the [Berlin] Wall came down.""    Merkel was born in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1954, but when she was 8 weeks old her father, a Lutheran minister named Horst Kasner, moved his family to Templin, a resort town on a lake in East Germany.    It was still seven years before the Berlin Wall went up, but even then it was unusual for families to be moving from West to East.    Father took family to the East    ""There were a few young ministers who did their studies in the West and then went to the East to take part in building the socialist society. He [Kasner] was not forced to go. It was his own decision. He was convinced by socialism,"" Boysen said.    Merkel grew up in a large, comfortable house on a leafy campus called the Waldhof that served as both a seminary for Lutheran pastors and a church-run school for the mentally handicapped. Her father was the head of the seminary, and part of the family house was used as a dormitory for the seminarians.    In many ways, it was a privileged upbringing in what was fast becoming one of the Soviet bloc's most repressive dictatorships. Because of her father's position, the family had access to books that otherwise were forbidden. The association with the church also meant that the family was isolated from most of the regime's worst excesses.    Jobst Reifenstein, a Lutheran deacon who has been head of the school for the handicapped since 1982 and knew the Kasner family well, described the Waldhof as a kind of refuge from the totalitarian state. But he said the families living there always were viewed with suspicion by others in the town.    As a teen, Merkel joined the Free German Youth, the communist youth organization. Membership in the group was regarded as essential for anyone interested in gaining admission to an elite university, but some still consider it a troublesome blot on her resume.    ""My father was also a pastor,"" said Ulrich Schoeneich, the present mayor of Templin, ""and the Schoeneich children were not members of the communist youth organization.    ""It's up to parents to decide how best to raise their children, but for us--no youth organization, no high school, no university. My father was clearly oppositional [to the regime].""    Schoeneich, who worked as a maintenance man at the Waldhof, said he had to postpone his education until adulthood.    Merkel, meanwhile, excelled as a student at the University of Leipzig and later at the prestigious Academy of Sciences in East Berlin.    Both Merkel and her family have been tight-lipped about the past, and it is hard to place them on the political spectrum. She was not available for an interview for this article.    ""To describe them as 'oppositional' would be too strong a word,"" said Boysen, the biographer. ""I think they tried to find a place in the system--not too deeply involved, but not completely detached.""    When the Berlin Wall came down, Merkel's interest in politics was kindled. After serving briefly as deputy spokeswoman for the first (and last) democratically elected government of East Germany, she joined the CDU, and within months of reunification, at age 36, became minister for women and youth in Kohl's Cabinet. Later she was named environmental minister.    Under Kohl's wing, her rise through the ranks of the CDU was swift. But in 1999, when Kohl became mired in an embarrassing scandal involving secret donors and illegal party slush funds, she was one of the first to turn on him.    Critics call her 'black widow'    As she continued to make her way up the CDU's ladder, the ease with which she vanquished male rivals, moving decisively at the moment when they seemed most vulnerable, led some critics to refer to her as ""the black widow.""    Although Merkel has twice held Cabinet posts and three times been elected party chairwoman, she has never faced ordinary voters, nor has she ever served as governor of one of Germany's states, the usual springboard to the chancellorship. She is a ""master craftsman"" of party politics, but the chancellorship will be the first real test of her governing skills, said Gero Neugebauer, an elections expert at the Berlin Free University.    Thus far her performance on the campaign trail has tended toward the lackluster and error-prone.    Faced with Schroeder's formidable television skills, Merkel's advisers insisted on limiting her exposure to a single 90-minute television debate early next month instead of the usual two one- hour encounters.    The likely subject will be the economy. Unemployment hovers at 11.6 percent, and Germany is in the throes of an unpopular and painful reform of its welfare state, which is the main reason Schroeder appears to be about to lose his job. But unlike Britain's Thatcher, a conservative leader who was champing at the bit to take on the trade unions and reinvent the economy, Merkel has been vague about her plans for Germany.    Those who have known her the longest are the most puzzled.    ""If I watch TV or the debates in parliament, you hear a lot of criticism from her about what the others are doing wrong, but she doesn't specify how she would make it better,"" said Reifenstein, the school director in Templin.    ""Her ideology? I don't know,"" shrugged Schoeneich, the mayor. ""What I do know is that she knows how to get power. She's a woman who can adapt.""    Even though Merkel is an Ossie, an Easterner, few people from the former East Germany seem to regard her as one of their own. To lure Eastern voters, Merkel's political handlers considered fashioning a separate campaign emphasizing her roots, but they quickly scrapped the idea.    ""No one would believe it,"" said Neugebauer, the election analyst.    On the international stage, Merkel is an ""uncritical friend"" of President Bush, according to Neugebauer, but she has nevertheless avoided recent photo opportunities with the U.S. president because he remains deeply unpopular in Germany. She has characterized the Iraq war as ""unavoidable,"" but the prospect of Merkel committing German troops to the cause is considered remote.    If Merkel's commanding lead continues to slip, the CDU may have to consider a ""grand coalition"" with the SPD, but for now the CDU has closed ranks.    ""Their thinking is this: 'We don't love her, but as long as she's winning, we will support her,'"" said Neugebauer.    ----------    thundley@tribune.com PHOTOS 2; Caption: PHOTO (color): Angela Merkel campaigns last week in Wittenberg, Germany.

294,420696124.xml,"      Over the past decade, as borders and barriers across an increasingly integrated Europe seemingly fell with each passing day, new ones were being constructed around Serbia. Most Serbs chafed under their deepening isolation, but a sense of national martyrdom and the refusal to turn over two indicted war criminals converged to keep Serbia on Europe's doorstep, a festering trouble spot for the continent. The European Union made clear that impoverished Serbia would be kept in penury as long as its government refused to make a serious effort to arrest former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his top general, Ratko Mladic, the men accused of authorizing the executions of thousands of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. But with the dramatic capture of Karadzic, who investigators said Tuesday had hid in plain view for years in Belgrade, the door to Europe may have begun to swing open for Serbia. When he was grabbed on a Belgrade bus, the 63-year-old Karadzic looked more like a Balkan Santa Claus than the former leader who had become Europe's most wanted man. His trademark shelf of silver hair was gone, replaced by a flowing white beard and long, silvery mane. Karadzic was arrested in what appears to have been a carefully planned operation. According to Serbian authorities, he had been practicing medicine in Belgrade under a false identity, attending public meetings, appearing on local television and even contributing articles on ""spirituality"" to a wellness magazine. He reportedly possessed fake documents and lived under the name Dragan Dabic, a guise that prosecutors said allowed him to walk freely around Belgrade. ""His false identity was very convincing,"" Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Tuesday in Belgrade. ""Even his landlords were unaware of his identity."" The arrest was hailed across Europe, which had demanded Karadzic and Mladic's arrests as a non-negotiable condition of Serbia's entry to the EU. ""We have waited for this for 13 years. Finally. Finally,"" French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said in Brussels. ""This is a very good thing for the rapprochement of Serbia with the European Union."" For much of the 1990s, Karadzic and Mladic were the face of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, crimes they are accused of committing in full view of the public while European governments sat by. Karadzic spoke of the ""necessity"" of subjecting the civilians of Sarajevo to a siege that lasted nearly four years, and of how his campaign to force Muslims and Croats from their homes in Bosnia was really doing them a favor. Mladic reportedly served as eager executioner. Darkest chapter The two are accused of writing the darkest chapter of recent European history in July 1995 when they orchestrated the execution of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, in an area supposedly protected by UN forces. That November, the two were indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague to face genocide charges. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Karadzic's arrest a ""historic moment."" ""The victims need to know: Massive human rights violations do not go unpunished,"" she said. Karadzic's political career crashed soon after Srebrenica with the signing of the Dayton peace agreements, which ousted him as leader of the Republika Srpska. He and Mladic had already been indicted by the war crimes tribunal. And thus they began their careers as fugitives. Karadzic was widely believed to have taken refuge in  monasteries in Bosnia and neighboring Montenegro. Despite the presence of thousands of NATO troops in Bosnia, and frequent reports of sightings of the bushy-haired leader and his red Mercedes sedan, he managed to elude capture. Mladic, 66, remains at large. Although many in Europe expect that he will be arrested soon, he is a somewhat more difficult case than Karadzic. He is believed to retain a support network of former Yugoslav soldiers, and taking him alive could be tricky. Among a shrinking core of extreme Serb nationalists, Karadzic and Mladic are still regarded as heroes. But the EU's refusal to consider Serbia for membership until it arrested the two most infamous war crimes suspects has gradually turned public opinion against them. When Boris Tadic, a pro-Western moderate, was re-elected president earlier this year on a promise to steer Serbia toward EU membership, the arrests of Karadzic and Mladic seemed increasingly likely. ""The parliamentary election opened the door -- and it showed that the public was ahead of the politicians,"" said Sonja Biserko of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia. ""Karadzic was a symbol of the Milosevic policy. [Former Serbian President and Prime Minister Vojislav] Kostunica was installed as someone who had to keep the same policies by other means. This is now the end. Karadzic is the end of these two epochs,"" she said. Tadic defeated a hard-line nationalist, Tomislav Nikolic, in a close election last February. He was not able to form a new government until early this month. Last Friday, the Cabinet replaced the head of the secret police; Karadzic's arrest followed. His lawyer said Karadzic was arrested Friday, but the government says the arrest came Monday night. Street protests The Bosnian Serb's capture generated  street protests in Belgrade, with police at one point clashing with about 200 nationalists who were demonstrating against the government. There was a lot of chatter, as well. Dragan Ilic, host of Belgrade Radio B92's top morning show, said the station was flooded with calls, including some from people who had seen Karadzic at local appearances and on Serbian television shows. ""Two girls called in and told me that he was very nice,"" Ilic said. ""He was calm and was a good lecturer. He talked about ... meditation and how it related somehow to Serbian Orthodox monks' spiritual pilgrimages."" He added that most of the talk was focused on the surprise elements of Karadzic's capture. No one quite expected the Bosnian Serb leader to be captured on a bus. And no one, Ilic said, expected him to ""look like Santa Claus."" Karadzic's next grand stage will be the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, where he will face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. If convicted, he would probably spend the rest of his life in prison. ---------- thundley@tribune.com cspolar@tribune.com Credit: By Tom Hundley and Christine Spolar, TRIBUNE REPORTERS Tom Hundley reported from Chicago and Chris Spolar from Barcelona.

295,2441471109.xml,"August was busy for Russia this year. While dealing with growing popular protests in the east, Moscow has sought to distract attention by engaging in nefarious activities, both at home and abroad. It's prepared to intervene in neighboring Belarus, confronted U.S. military forces on land, at sea and in the air, stepped up its interference in the U.S. presidential elections and poisoned yet another opposition figure. None of these activities have gone unnoticed in Europe or the United States. But so far, the actions have been met with a few words of condemnation that together amount to little more than a collective shrug. When it comes to Russia, the West remains mostly divided -- and no one has stepped up to lead the way to collective action.There are some signs that may be changing, however, with Germany seemingly poised to lead an effort toward a more effective response to Russia's continuing efforts to undermine security and stability in Europe and beyond.When Alexander Lukashenko, Europe's last dictator, blatantly stole the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus, Putin at first waited to see how developments would unfold. But with hundreds of thousands of Belarusians taking to the streets to demand Lukashenko's ouster and new elections, Putin made clear where he stood. He announced the creation of a special security force that could be deployed at the Belarusian leader's request, sent advisers to help Lukashenko control the opposition, and promised $1 billion in financial support, tying Belarus ever closer to Russia.So far, Europe and the United States have done little more than condemn the flawed elections, express concern about violence and warn Russia not to intervene. But they've not imposed any new sanctions or put forward other measures to put teeth in these demands, implicitly conceding that Putin calls the shots.Last month also saw Russia flexing its military muscle. Russian fighters flew within 100 feet of B-52 bombers flying over the Black and Baltic seas and later penetrated deep into Danish airspace as they flanked the bombers. On the other side of the world, six Russian maritime patrol aircraft flew close to Alaskan airspace, scrambling U.S. fighters to intercept the planes. And in Syria, a Russian patrol rammed a U.S. armored vehicle, injuring seven U.S. soldiers.Not only are these actions dangerous, their aggressive nature emphasizes the Russian military's increasing confidence in challenging U.S. and allied militaries across the globe.Even though Moscow was caught red-handed interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the U.S. intelligence community reported last month that it was stepping up its activities in this year's election. Russia, it said, is using ""a range of measures"" to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy and support the reelection of President Donald Trump.While Democrats have predictably condemned Moscow's blatant interference, Trump has dismissed the reports as a ""hoax,"" and some of his top appointees have told intelligence analysts to stop looking for Russian interference and focus on China and Iran instead. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to attack our democratic process.Russia's latest outrage is the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, Putin's most severe and popular critic. After a comatose Navalny was flown to Germany for medical treatment last month, scientists there determined ""beyond all doubt"" that he had been poisoned with the chemical nerve agent novichok -- the same chemical Russia used to poison its ex-intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Britain two years ago.It's possible that the attack on Navalny will backfire on Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted with fury to the poisoning, calling it an ""attempted murder"" and demanding the Russian government provide an explanation of this ""crime intended to silence him."" Berlin has consulted with its EU and NATO allies, and is taking the matter to the organization charged with enforcing the global ban on chemical weapons.Inside Germany, pressure is rising to take stronger action -- including suspending or even canceling Nord Stream 2, the controversial and nearly completed pipeline owned by Russia that will supply gas directly to Germany without having to transit Ukraine or Eastern Europe. Key government ministers have suggested that the project be halted absent a convincing explanation by Moscow of what happened to Navalny.There is an opportunity to turn this newfound determination into effective action. Merkel should agree to at least suspend construction of the pipeline (though its cancellation would be better). With that decision in hand, she should propose to her European and American allies to impose biting sanctions on those responsible for the attempt on Navalny's life. And she should urge President Trump to reverse the announced withdrawal of U.S. troops from Germany -- a decision that weakens NATO and is widely seen as a strategic gift to Putin.It's long past time to stand up to Putin. Moscow's latest escalations only underscore the urgency. Normally, the U.S. president would galvanize the Europeans into action. Given Trump's long-standing deference to Putin, that's not going to happen. It's now up to Merkel to take the lead.----------Ivo Daalder is president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S. ambassador to NATO.CAPTION: Photo: A woman wrapped in an old Belarusian national flag reacts as opposition supporters gather Sunday near Independence Palace.

296,2429401344.xml,"This month, a one-year anniversary arrives on Aug. 23. On that date in 2019, prominent former U. S. Attorney Dan Webb was named special prosecutor to take a fresh looking at the handling of the infamous case of actor Jussie Smollett. The actor was charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct for allegedly faking a hate crime. Chicago police said the investigation cost more than $130,000. The charges were subsequently dropped by Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx not long after, according to news stories, she received a personal phone call from politically-connected attorney Tina Tchen on Smollett’s behalf. News reports stated that Judge Michael Toomin appointed Webb as special prosecutor because Foxx “inappropriately named her top deputy to take over after recusing herself” from the case.
Another important date is coming up: November 3. On that day, local voters will decide if they want to reelect Kim Foxx as state’s attorney. Wouldn’t it be helpful to know whether or not she violated the people’s faith in her by impropriety in the Smollett case? Webb will have less than three months from that one-year anniversary until the eve of the election to inform voters about Foxx.

As a social studies teacher in Chicago, the remarks on “Democracy Under Siege” by Mayor Lori Lightfoot provide not only teachers, students and parents with a teachable moment but an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the times we live in and to answer a few key questions about democracy and social activism examples we are we setting and want our youth to emulate.
The reality is we do live in times of a pandemic where social unrest, protests, violence, social and economic hardships are fueled by hyper-partisanship, extreme divisiveness, disillusion with government and intolerance for basic humanity.
As the mayor explains, “Pain and righteous anger brought thousands into our city streets in a mass call for change.” Activism is urgent when a system is considered corrupt, inherently racist, lacking equity and justice. Here is where our democracy demands solutions.
Yet, when people and members of society have little compassion for protesters getting their teeth knocked out or for the suffering of police officers sent to the emergency room, it sends a signal that something in our democracy is wrong. When our way of resolving society’s troubles is tone deaf to listening to one another and rather blames and vilifies others that don’t share our views, we have reached a point of pure hatred and loss of democratic values.
So what is democracy?
Perhaps its easier to explain what it is isn’t. According to Lightfoot, democracy is flawed when driven by radical extreme thinking from the right or from the left that is unwilling to listen to anyone else. Similarly, democracy is not about who can scream the loudest. Democracy stops working when the people stop trusting their government. Lightfoot argues that people feel a sense of disaffection and disconnection, so they turn to other ways of solving their problems. Sadly, that is either through violence or by erasing any effort to listen or compromise on peaceful solutions. In 2020, democracy is also restricted in part by the enormous weight of social media and inability for people to engage directly and instead hide behind their devices.
As teachers, parents and adults we should consider that it’s not too late to return to democracy in which we are willing to listen, tolerate different viewpoints and learn to compromise, as opposed to blindly follow radical divisive extremes. We should promote nonviolent activism and engage directly with one another in a democratic process that underscores mutual respect and accountable government.
Our children stand to benefit much more if our version of democracy prioritizes peaceful solutions instead of hostile attacks.

We talk about “what if” President Donald Trump will not accept the result of the election if he loses. There is no “what if” — you simply pick him up under the arms and march him out the door.

In reference to President Trump’s withdrawing 12,000 troops from Germany, Deutsch Welle (German) television made the point that Russia has reemerged as a powerful threat to long-standing and emerging European democracies. Countries such as Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltics are extremely nervous, seeking more U.S. military support and rightly so.
In the last few years, Russia has invaded and occupied Crimea, a large section of eastern Ukraine, 20% of Georgia, parts of Syria, and conducted continuous probing and incursions of Sweden and the Baltic countries. Add to this the many assassinations of Vladimir Putin’s “enemies” residing on foreign soil. This is not the sleeping, benign Russia that emerged under Boris Yeltsin after the communist overthrow. Putin has shown he sees a reawakened Russia that should never have abandoned its former empire.
With the return to Cold War tensions with European democracies, now is not the time to give this “gift” to Russia. In addition, Italy contributes much less to defense than Germany, yet the U.S. military is being bolstered there. It’s apparent that Trump has a personal tiff with Angela Merkel, and being a hot tempered personality this is simply his retribution in foreign policy.

Your July 26 story on Chicago’s largest cultural institutions confirms my suspicions that they will survive this pandemic. As a member of both the Art Institute and the Field Museum, I’m very grateful that their futures are secure. During this pandemic, we should also be concerned about the hundreds of smaller arts organizations that not only make Chicago a vibrant place to live, but also help address the challenges underserved neighborhoods face. South Shore Drill Team is just one example, and through my involvement I have firsthand knowledge of the many lives the group has saved over the past 40 years while entertaining millions of people across the country. With 36 events which would have brought in $80,000 in performance fees canceled, my sincere hope is that they, too, will continue for another 40 years and beyond.

The Animal Legal Defense Fund has commended Illinois for having the best animal protection laws in the country. This compassionate and humane accomplishment merits lauding. It’s especially edifying because Illinois also has a strong record regarding human rights. Members of the Illinois House and Senate deserve credit for enacting these laws. The onus is on law enforcement animal crimes units, prosecutors and judges to do the right thing and enforce these laws.

297,1857272329.xml,"       Moscow's apparent cyberattack on the Democrats, not on the U.S.  government ... actually did Americans a favor, exposing wrongdoing  by their own officials. And Washington officials, who routinely  interfere in the elections of other nations, have no credibility  claiming to be shocked, shocked to find another nation doing the  same. The U.S. needs better cybersecurity, but is no virgin in such  challenges: Washington is thought to have used the Stuxnet virus to  hinder Iran's nuclear research and listened in on German Chancellor  Angela Merkel's cellphone. Washington should learn from the  Democratic hack, not declare Russia to be an enemy. ...  Washington's policy toward Russia needs a genuine reset. The U.S.  should take a tough but practical approach toward Moscow,  recognizing that sometimes a clash of interests does not enemies  make. American officials should stop searching for new adversaries. -- Doug Bandow, The National Interest  As we look back on our season of surprises -- from Bob Dylan's  Nobel Prize to Donald Trump's election -- what we're being reminded  of, surely, is how very little we know. On Nov. 7, thanks to more  data than had ever been collected before, updated every second for  16 months or more, we all knew what was coming. By midnight the  following day, we realized that all the data in the world don't add  up to real life.  Remember in ""Othello"" how the seasoned warrior is coaxed away from  the realm of knowledge and into the adjacent territories of  inference and rumor, by his old friend Iago? The minute he is  severed from real life, on the ""rack"" of his own thoughts,  declaring ""Iago is most honest"" after Iago has confided to us, ""I  am not what I am,"" the noble Moor can't be sure of a thing. Our  pollsters, our pundits, our sources of ""news"" -- our know-it-all  selves -- work much the same ground, though perhaps with less  malicious intent, to convince us that hearsay + opinion + guesswork  = truth.  -- Pico Iyer, The New York Times  ",2017-01-11
298,420828525.xml,"      The failure to agree on swift, concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the summit meeting of the world's most advanced economies pointed to hard bargaining ahead on global warming -- especially on the politically sensitive issue of who should go first. President Barack Obama and his counterparts in the Group of Eight, who on Wednesday began two days of meetings in this central Italian mountain town, announced broad agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat rising global temperatures over the next four decades. They also prepared to offer new financial incentives for other nations to join in the effort -- including China, the world's leading source of heat-trapping gas. But the G-8 stopped well short of pledging to take the kinds of steps that could curb emissions more quickly but also impose higher prices for electricity and other energy, while potentially aggravating the woes of the global economy. And neither the broad promises of future action nor the relatively modest financial incentives were likely to break the standoff between the most economically advanced nations and China, India, Brazil and other emerging powerhouses that have insisted wealthier nations should take the lead. ""China's not going to do anything until the developed countries send a signal that they're going to do something,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate expert who teaches at Princeton University. The stalemate on the international stage mirrors Obama's problem at home. Though the House approved a major climate bill last month, Republicans and others have unleashed a hailstorm of criticism. Unless China and other developing nations make firm commitments to cut back emissions, the Republicans say, emissions limits by the United States would have relatively little impact on global warming but could hamstring the already recessionary domestic economy. Obama's climate bill, which narrowly passed the House, could send a strong signal if it becomes law, said Dirk Forrister, a former climate negotiator under President Bill Clinton. But, he said, ""The U.S. Senate will not go along with anything unless it sees some pretty serious action from developing countries."" That, analysts say, sums up Obama's conundrum as he tries to push for a meaningful climate agreement during formal treaty negotiations in Copenhagen this winter. ""It looks like it's going to be a pretty tough fight (in Copenhagen) based on what happened in these meetings in Italy,"" Forrister said. U.S. leaders hinted that a broad coalition of developing and developed nations could announce agreements Thursday to team up on research into renewable energy and technology to scrub and store greenhouse emissions from coal. Michael Froman, an Obama administration official on hand at the G-8 summit, argued that the major industrial nations' joint statement favoring an 80 percent reduction in their emissions by 2050 represents ""significant cooperation"" -- even though it comes up short of the draft language the White House supported. The G-8 roughly followed targets in Obama's domestic climate bill. The G-8 countries also set a global goal of 50 percent emissions reductions by midcentury and recognized ""the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed"" 2 degrees Celsius. They did not announce any specific plans to cut emissions or adopt any short- or midterm reduction targets. The United States pushed, and failed, to get developing nations to join in the reduction pledge. ""In any negotiation, you put in a number of points,"" Froman said. ""Sometimes they make it in and sometimes they don't."" The statement that did not come -- the one that would have included China, Brazil and other developing countries -- is the one that matters, he acknowledged. But both he and chief Obama climate negotiator Todd Stern argued that there is plenty of room to work out an agreement before the Copenhagen summit. ""It's a negotiation. Countries may make concessions further down the road,"" Stern said in an interview. - - - Day 1 highlights Some actions Wednesday by G-8 leaders: The economy: Said the global economy ""remains uncertain"" and stimulus programs should remain in place.

299,1413407210.xml,"       The International Monetary Fund's board approved the release of $2.3 billion to Greece, helping replenish the country's coffers through German elections in September that will help set the course of Europe's crisis response. ""The Greek authorities have continued to make commendable progress in reducing fiscal and external imbalances,"" IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement Monday. ""However, progress on institutional and structural reforms, in the public sector and beyond, has still not been commensurate with the problems facing Greece. Greater reform efforts remain key to an economic recovery and lasting growth.""   Greece received IMF approval three days after obtaining the release of $3.3 billion from euro-area governments under their rescue package. One of the conditions was to pursue a plan to put 4,200 state employees on notice for dismissal, which the Greek Parliament adopted last week.   With Greek 10-year bond yields six times Germany's almost four years after the European debt crisis flared in Athens, the country is still relying on its international creditors. Greece's financial fate has also become entwined with German politics, as Chancellor Angela Merkel campaigns for a third term on the promise that Germany won't write off any of the loans made to Greece since the debt crisis broke.   That contrasts with repeated warnings by the IMF, which has said Greece's debt level remains a risk to its recovery and suggested last month that the country may require faster debt relief from its European creditors.   The Greek debt burden is almost double the average of the 17-nation euro area, according to the European Union's statistics office July 22. First-quarter debt stood at 160.5 percent of gross domestic product.   Lagarde reiterated Monday that support from Europe to reduce Greece's debt to ""substantially below 110 percent of GDP by 2022"" is welcome.   Separately, the fund insists on seeing a 12-month guarantee of Greece's financing in order to continue with its own lending, and a $5 billion gap is expected in 2014.  ",2013-07-30
300,2441301068.xml,"August was busy for Russia this year. While dealing with growing popular protests in the east, Moscow has sought to distract attention by engaging in nefarious activities, both at home and abroad. It’s prepared to intervene in neighboring Belarus, confronted U.S. military forces on land, at sea and in the air, stepped up its interference in the U.S. presidential elections and poisoned yet another opposition figure.
None of these activities have gone unnoticed in Europe or the United States. But so far, the actions have been met with a few words of condemnation that together amount to little more than a collective shrug. When it comes to Russia, the West remains mostly divided — and no one has stepped up to lead the way to collective action.
There are some signs that may be changing, however, with Germany seemingly poised to lead an effort toward a more effective response to Russia’s continuing efforts to undermine security and stability in Europe and beyond.
When Alexander Lukashenko, Europe’s last dictator, blatantly stole the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus, Putin at first waited to see how developments would unfold. But with hundreds of thousands of Belarusians taking to the streets to demand Lukashenko’s ouster and new elections, Putin made clear where he stood. He announced the creation of a special security force that could be deployed at the Belarusian leader’s request, sent advisers to help Lukashenko control the opposition, and promised $1 billion in financial support, tying Belarus ever closer to Russia.
So far, Europe and the United States have done little more than condemn the flawed elections, express concern about violence and warn Russia not to intervene. But they’ve not imposed any new sanctions or put forward other measures to put teeth in these demands, implicitly conceding that Putin calls the shots.
Last month also saw Russia flexing its military muscle. Russian fighters flew within 100 feet of B-52 bombers flying over the Black and Baltic seas and later penetrated deep into Danish airspace as they flanked the bombers. On the other side of the world, six Russian maritime patrol aircraft flew close to Alaskan airspace, scrambling U.S. fighters to intercept the planes. And in Syria, a Russian patrol rammed a U.S. armored vehicle, injuring seven U.S. soldiers.
Not only are these actions dangerous, their aggressive nature emphasizes the Russian military’s increasing confidence in challenging U.S. and allied militaries across the globe.
Even though Moscow was caught red-handed interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the U.S. intelligence community reported last month that it was stepping up its activities in this year’s election. Russia, it said, is using “a range of measures” to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden’s candidacy and support the reelection of President Donald Trump.
While Democrats have predictably condemned Moscow’s blatant interference, Trump has dismissed the reports as a “hoax,” and some of his top appointees have told intelligence analysts to stop looking for Russian interference and focus on China and Iran instead. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to attack our democratic process.
Russia’s latest outrage is the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most severe and popular critic. After a comatose Navalny was flown to Germany for medical treatment last month, scientists there determined “beyond all doubt” that he had been poisoned with the chemical nerve agent novichok — the same chemical Russia used to poison its ex-intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Britain two years ago.
It’s possible that the attack on Navalny will backfire on Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted with fury to the poisoning, calling it an “attempted murder” and demanding the Russian government provide an explanation of this “crime intended to silence him.” Berlin has consulted with its EU and NATO allies, and is taking the matter to the organization charged with enforcing the global ban on chemical weapons.
Inside Germany, pressure is rising to take stronger action — including suspending or even canceling Nord Stream 2, the controversial and nearly completed pipeline owned by Russia that will supply gas directly to Germany without having to transit Ukraine or Eastern Europe. Key government ministers have suggested that the project be halted absent a convincing explanation by Moscow of what happened to Navalny.
There is an opportunity to turn this newfound determination into effective action. Merkel should agree to at least suspend construction of the pipeline (though its cancellation would be better). With that decision in hand, she should propose to her European and American allies to impose biting sanctions on those responsible for the attempt on Navalny’s life. And she should urge President Trump to reverse the announced withdrawal of U.S. troops from Germany — a decision that weakens NATO and is widely seen as a strategic gift to Putin.
It’s long past time to stand up to Putin. Moscow’s latest escalations only underscore the urgency. Normally, the U.S. president would galvanize the Europeans into action. Given Trump’s long-standing deference to Putin, that’s not going to happen. It’s now up to Merkel to take the lead.

301,283003714.xml,"






Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, embarrassed by a mystery challenger two weeks ago, won a landslide victory Sunday in Poland's first direct presidential election.


Walesa trounced rags-to-riches candidate Stanislaw Tyminski in a runoff that was both a testament to the Solidarity leader's enduring personal appeal and the growing disillusionment he will confront as president.


Preliminary results based on early returns and an exit poll by a respected German research firm showed Walesa coasting to victory with around 75 percent of the vote-nearly twice the total he managed against five other contenders in the Nov. 25 primary.


""I want to become your biggest servant, not a president,"" Walesa told a crowd of supporters chanting the diminutive of his name, ""Lechu, Lechu,"" in the streets of Gdansk. ""I want to serve you. I will not be playing. I will work with you.""


At his campaign headquarters, near the former Lenin Shipyard where the Solidarity movement was born in 1980, Walesa was greeted with champagne and the traditional Polish song of celebration: ""Sto Lat"" (""May you live 100 years"").


""Over the past decade together we have experienced a turning point in our nation's history,"" Walesa said. ""The dreams of generations have been fulfilled before our very eyes.


""Without bloodshed and through the efforts of Solidarity, we have won a free Poland. It is entirely up to us what we do with it in the future.""


As recently as two weeks ago, though, there was some question whether Walesa would have a powerful say in the future. He had predicted he would win 80 percent of the vote in the primary and was stunned to get only 39 percent.


Tyminski, who had not lived in Poland since 1969, got nearly 25 percent of the vote in the primary. He cut sharply into Walesa's support and eliminated Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the race.


Mazowiecki, hand-picked by Walesa in August 1989 to become Eastern Europe's first non-Communist leader in four decades, resigned in humiliation the day after the primary. He agreed to stay on until the new president can appoint his own prime minister.


No date has been set for Walesa's inauguration, but aides said it probably would be sometime between Dec. 21 and Christmas. The Polish Supreme Court will need at least a week to certify the official results, which were expected to be released Monday.


When he is sworn in, Walesa, 47, will succeed Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party boss who declared martial law nine years ago this week in a failed attempt to crush Solidarity.


In recent years, Jaruzelski has helped implement many of Poland's democratic reforms and earned a reputation as a president of reconciliation. But he will forever be remembered as the man who called out Polish troops to arrest thousands of his own people, including Walesa and Mazowiecki.


Jaruzelski was among the first to congratulate Walesa, sending a telegram addressed to the ""president-elect"" wishing him success in guiding Poland to ""her due position among states and nations of the world.""


Tyminski, however, lashed out at Walesa in defeat, continuing the bitter tone of a campaign that had grown uglier by the day.


""Every country gets the government it deserves,"" Tyminski said on national television.


""I still hope that there will be political change in Poland because we still have a colonial regime, a totalitarian regime. I am of the opinion that the situation has never been as bad as it is now.""


Born in a Warsaw suburb, Tyminski emigrated to Sweden in 1969 when most Poles found it difficult to get exit visas. He later moved to Canada, where he said he made millions with a computer company he started from scratch.


Tyminski was virtually unknown in Poland until October, when he collected the 100,000 signatures needed to run for president. He later admitted he got many of those signatures by paying students to round them up or by offering free movie tickets to anyone who would sign.


But once he qualified, Tyminski captured the imagination and votes of millions of Poles with a slick television campaign that portrayed him as a business genius who could turn Poland into a ""democracy of money.""


That promise was music to the ears of voters whose incomes have plummeted nearly 40 percent under an economic reform program that Mazowiecki introduced to build a free market out of the chaos left behind by the Communists.


In Chicago, a jubilant crowd listened to the election results Sunday night at the Polish American Congress, 5844 N. Milwaukee Ave., where Ald. Roman Pucinski (41st) said: ""This is a great day. . . . There were some people that were really scared that this Tyminski guy would pull an upset.""


Walesa provoked the unscheduled presidential election by accusing Mazowiecki of moving too slowly with reforms.


Walesa and the Polish news media at first ignored Tyminski, but after the primary they launched a scathing attack, accusing him of everything from beating his wife to leading a ""Communist counter-revolution.""


Despite the relentless charges, Tyminski attracted a significant portion of the electorate: nearly 1 in 4 votes in each round.


Tyminski was drubbed in the runoff, but nearly 3.5 million voters supported him.


Jacek Merkel, a key Walesa aide, remarked on Tyminski's solid support in both rounds: ""We will have to take these people into account. It is clear they are unhappy. We can't just ignore them.""

302,420389376.xml,"         Iraqi forces clashed with insurgents Friday near the notorious airport road and other districts of western Baghdad, arresting nearly 60 people as the sounds of a rousing song, ""Where are the terrorists now?"" blared from police car loudspeakers.    The fiercest clashes occurred in the Jihad district along the main road to Baghdad International Airport, scene of numerous bombings and ambushes.    U.S. attack helicopters roamed the skies, and the rattle of automatic weapons fire echoed through the streets as motorists abandoned their vehicles and merchants shuttered their shops.    Snipers on rooftops    Iraqi troops armed with assault rifles and machine guns blocked access to the areas where security operations were under way. Residents reported seeing insurgent snipers on rooftops in the Jihad area and masked gunmen, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, in the alleyways.    An Associated Press photographer watched as gunmen shot dead two men trying to flee the area. Residents said the two were killed because they were collaborating with the Americans.    In the Saydiyah neighborhood, witnesses said police hustled about a dozen men, blindfolded and handcuffed, into pickup trucks and then drove away, while police car loudspeakers blared the lyrics to a commando fight song -- ""Oh God, you protected the homeland, where are the terrorists now?""    Police said about 60 people had been arrested in the confrontations. There was no word on casualties.    Raids by Shiite-led government's security forces into Sunni neighborhoods have sharpened sectarian tensions as Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish politicians try, under intense U.S. pressure, to organize a broad-based government after last month's elections.    U.S. officials hope such a government can win the trust of Sunni Arabs and lure them away from the Sunni-dominated insurgency. Sunni politicians have insisted on changes in the leadership of the security forces before they will join the government.    During a sermon Friday at the Umm al-Qura mosque, Sunni cleric Ahmed Abdul Ghafour al-Samarraei condemned raids into Sunni communities by ""death squads wearing police uniforms.""    ""Should an Iraqi man surrender? If he surrenders, he will be detained and tortured. If he resists, he will be considered a terrorist,"" al-Samarraei said.    Two Germans taken hostage in northern Iraq on Tuesday appealed to their government to help win their release in a videotape aired by Al Jazeera television. German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned ""this cruel kidnapping"" and called for their release ""without delay.""    The tape was the first sign of the two men since they were seized in Beiji, about 155 miles north of Baghdad, by gunmen wearing military uniforms. The engineers, who work for a company in Leipzig, were kidnapped two days after arriving in Iraq.    Relatives name hostages    The Germans, identified by relatives as Thomas Nitzschke and Rene Braeunlich, were seated on the floor in front of at least four armed men. The timer visible on the videotape indicated it was made less than two hours after they were kidnapped.    Each German could be seen speaking on the tape, but Al Jazeera did not broadcast any audio.    A handwritten black banner was shown on the tape reading: ""Supporters of Tawhid and Sunnah Brigades,"" a previously unknown group. Tawhid is the Arabic word for monotheism and Sunnah refers to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.    ""The [German] government condemns this cruel kidnapping in the strongest possible terms,"" Merkel said after the video was aired. ""We appeal urgently to the perpetrators to release our two compatriots without delay.""    At least five foreigners have been kidnapped this month: the Germans, two Kenyan engineers and an American journalist, Jill Carroll.    Carroll's kidnappers have threatened to kill her unless all Iraqi women are freed from custody. The U.S. military released five Iraqi women Thursday but said the move was unrelated to the kidnappers' demand.    The governor of the southern city of Basra threatened to stop dealing with British forces unless they release five Iraqi men detained since Tuesday. The five include police suspected of links to local killings and kidnappings blamed on Shiite militias.    Gov. Mohammed al-Waeli called for a demonstration Sunday outside the British Consulate to demand the release of the five men. Nine others have been freed.    Several hours after his call, a market bombing killed one woman and wounded three others, police said. Witnesses said a man stepped out of a police vehicle and planted the bomb.    Wave of violence    In other violence reported by officials, two Iraqi soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing in the northern city of Tal Afar, and a police officer died in a gunfight with insurgents in the northern city of Mosul.    In Youssifiyah, south of Baghdad, a roadside bomb missed a U.S. military patrol but killed two Iraqi civilians. Elsewhere, an Iraqi woman was shot dead in western Baghdad's Baiyaa district by police firing into the air while trying to clear blocked traffic.    In Baghdad's southern neighborhood of Dora, two gunmen entered a barber shop and killed a man waiting for a haircut. Shortly afterward, men firing from two speeding cars killed a driver for the Higher Education Ministry in the same neighborhood.    Also in the capital, police found a man's bullet-riddled body in a car. His identity cards indicated he was an interpreter for the U.S. military.

303,1013736371.xml,"      France's new president, Francois Hollande, and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel have opposing ideas of how to solve Europe's  crippling public debt crisis -- she austerity, he spending and  growth -- so a clash was in the cards Tuesday. Instead, Hollande's welcome to Berlin just hours after he took  office was brisk but warm, even if he was late for dinner.  Hollande, whose flight to Berlin was hit by lightning, causing him  to return to an air base outside Paris to quickly switch planes,  and Merkel met for an hour before dining together.  Last week, Hollande, 57, defeated incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy on a  promise to renegotiate Merkel's prized pact enshrining public  spending limits throughout the European Union. He believes in  spending and investment to encourage growth.  Observers described the atmosphere at the Berlin meeting as cordial  but awkward.  At an after-dinner news conference, Merkel joked that the lightning  strike, which did not cause any injuries, was a good omen for their  future relationship.  ""We have quite an intensive agenda in terms of European questions,""  she said.  The two leaders stood together in declaring their determination  that financially stricken Greece remain in the eurozone, the  17-nation group that uses the euro currency.  ""We want Greece to stay in the euro. We know that the majority of  people in Greece see that,"" Merkel said.  Hollande spoke of ""balance in the Franco-German relationship"" and  brought up the thorny subject of renegotiating the fiscal pact to  encourage European growth.  ""I said it during my election campaign and I say it again now as  president that I want to renegotiate what has been agreed to  include a growth dimension,"" Hollande said at the chancellery in  the German capital.  Earlier, Hollande, who is nicknamed Monsieur Normal, was  inaugurated as the 24th president of France at a ceremony in Paris.  The first Socialist leader of the country in 17 years arrived for  his swearing-in just in time after crossing Paris by car, stopping  at traffic lights and even waiting in a traffic jam. Hollande was  greeted by Sarkozy on the red-carpeted steps of the 18th-century  Elysee Palace, the traditional presidential residence.  ""On this day I am invested with the highest office of state, I send  the French a message of confidence. We are a great country that  throughout its history has risen to difficulties and challenges,""  Hollande said.  ""My job is to put France back on its feet with justice, to open a  new way in Europe, contribute to the peace of the world and the  preservation of the planet,"" he said, despite ""massive debt, weak  growth, high unemployment ... a Europe that is having difficulty  emerging from the crisis.""  The mantra of the Hollande government, he said, would be ""dignity,  simplicity and sobriety.""  Hollande is due in Washington late this week to meet President  Barack Obama before the Group of Eight meeting at Camp David and  the NATO summit in Chicago.

304,1475043368.xml,"       The prevailing view for 2014 is that the world is a safer place for  investors than it's been for the past six years. The U.S. economy  is in a sustainable recovery, the risk of a financial crisis in  Europe is low and China's growth is still apparently intact. But some analysts get nervous when they see so many of their peers  with identical views. History has shown that professionals have  been the most blind to risks just before a stock market nose dive.  That's why some consider the blissful attitudes of investment  advisers in a recent Investors Intelligence poll to be a yellow  flag.  ""Complacency is a source of concern,"" said Gluskin Sheff economist  David Rosenberg. He notes that bullish, or optimistic, advisers  make up 61.6 percent of the investment professionals polled. That's  the highest level of optimism since October 2007. And there are  very few professionals worried about the stock market. Only 14  percent of advisers polled are bearish -- the least since March  1987.  Those dates have to get your attention: High optimism preceded the  horrific 57 percent decline in the market that began in 2007, and  low bearishness preceded the 22 percent Black Monday plunge of  1987.  One of the precepts of investing is to continually discipline  yourself to watch for risks, and then hold a broad mixture of  stocks and bonds so you have insulation in case a shock hits  without warning.  One risk, Rosenberg said, is that analysts have ""very large  expectations"" for corporate profits. The consensus is for 10.5  percent earnings growth in 2014, which would be double 2013's 5  percent and a high bar given still modest GDP growth and anemic  sales growth. Concerns about upcoming earnings announcements may  have been why stocks started 2014 with three declining days before  the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 105.84 points Tuesday.  Throughout January, companies will be reporting their  fourth-quarter earnings, and investors aren't likely to be  forgiving if companies reveal that expectations were too lofty.  With stocks no longer cheap after climbing 30 percent in 2013,  profit disappointments could set off a correction in the stock  market. Still, strategist Ed Yardeni notes that's probably  unlikely, since companies intentionally get analysts to lower  expectations before earnings season so the companies can easily  beat forecasts.  Another risk mentioned frequently is that as the Federal Reserve  pulls away from stimulus, interest rates could rise more quickly  than expected and disrupt the economy or scare investors. To  anticipate the Fed's potential moves, watch unemployment numbers,  including Friday's. The Fed has suggested that it will be less  determined to hold interest rates down after unemployment goes  below 6.5 percent.  Still, most analysts think the largest risks to investors this year  will come from outside the U.S.  ""The biggest risk for equities would be some exogenous shock from  abroad, say China or even Europe,"" Rosenberg said. ""Events overseas  could influence risk appetite here at home even if there is little  economic impact.""  That was the case in 2011, 2012 and mid-2013, as the stock market  dipped at times when China's growth was in question, or as  investors feared that massive banking and debt problems would  undermine Europe and China.  In 2013, investors regained courage about investing in the eurozone  as Europe emerged from recession, and the European Central Bank  calmed fears about a financial crisis involving government debt and  banks. Countries like Spain are now borrowing money at low,  affordable interest rates compared with crippling levels of around  7 percent in 2012.  Yet, Barclays economist Philippe Gudin noted in a recent report  that concerns about eurozone banks and sovereign debts could bubble  up again in 2014 because banks are still weak and there is no  eurozonewide system like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to  step in and deal with banks that are insolvent. Yet, analysts tend  to think that panic won't re-emerge over a European financial  crisis, because there is a widespread belief that European Central  Bank leader Mario Draghi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will  make good on the vow to do ""whatever"" is necessary to defend the  euro.  Proposals on shoring up the European financial system will be  debated in the European Parliament in 2014, and investors could be  unnerved as some political nationalist groups in some countries  resist helping other countries. But Gudin said that with elections  planned in Europe in 2014, eurozone negotiations might be pushed to  2015. Meanwhile, Europe struggles to grow because troubled banks  are reluctant to lend money, and individual countries such as  France and Italy resist reforms that will be painful for workers.  Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer said Monday: ""Europe remains  very much in the muddled middle, with neither reform/recovery nor  crisis and eurozone collapse at all likely in the near future.""  China, too, is in an unsettled state as the Chinese government has  recently announced reforms that seem in conflict with each other.  ""Reforms might prove to be very successful, improving China's  investment climate and opportunities for integration in the world  economy,"" Bremmer said. ""Still, the government is loosening its  hold on key reins of the domestic economy on a historic scale, and  that could have serious unforeseen consequences.""  The biggest economic risks, he said, are in the financial sector,  where China's leaders recognize significant problems with bank  solvency and are expected to try to curtail future sloppy practices  by letting bad loans default without a bailout.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch's China economist team noted in a  recent report that in 2014, growth in China could be more stable  than in 2013, but the pace of growth has slowed to 7.6 percent.  Financial markets may be ""volatile"" in 2014, the economists said,  because China will face debt risks and ""overly rosy expectations on  reforms.""  Beyond these worries, the Eurasia Group is anticipating  geopolitical tensions in the Middle East to continue throughout  2014, with potential disruptions in oil. Yet, the U.S. is less  dependent on OPEC oil than it has been in the past because the U.S.  has greatly increased domestic oil production.  ---------- gmarksjarvis@tribune.com  Twitter @gailmarksjarvis Caption: Photo: Investors monitor stocks in China, where an unsettled  economy could provide reason for concern in 2014.

305,2350919063.xml,"The plane was late and the kill team was worried. International listings showed that Cham Wings Airlines Flight 6Q501, scheduled to take off from Damascus, Syria, at 7:30 p.m. for Baghdad, had departed; but in fact, an informant at the airport reported, it was still on the ground, and the targeted passenger had not yet shown up.
The hours ticked by, and some involved in the operation wondered if it should be called off. Then, just before the plane door closed, a convoy of cars pulled up on the tarmac carrying Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s security mastermind, who climbed on board along with two escorts. Flight 6Q501 lifted off, three hours late, bound for the Iraqi capital.
The plane landed at Baghdad International Airport just after midnight, at 12:36 a.m., and the first to disembark were Soleimani and his entourage. Waiting at the bottom of the gangway was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi official in charge of militias and close to Iran. Two cars carrying the group headed into the night — shadowed by American MQ-9 Reaper drones. At 12:47, the first of several missiles smashed into the vehicles, engulfing them in flames and leaving 10 charred bodies inside.
The operation that took out Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, propelled the United States to the precipice of war with Iran and plunged the world into seven days of roiling uncertainty. The story of those seven days, and the secret planning in the months preceding them, ranks as the most perilous chapter so far in President Donald Trump’s three years in office: his decision to launch an audacious strike on Iran, and his attempt through allies and a back channel to keep the ensuing crisis from mushrooming out of control.
The president’s decision to ratchet up decades of simmering conflict with Iran set off an extraordinary worldwide drama, much of which played out behind the scenes. In capitals from Europe to the Middle East, leaders and diplomats sought to head off a full-fledged new war, while at the White House and Pentagon, the president and his advisers ordered more troops to the region.
Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler was so alarmed, he dispatched his brother to Washington for a clandestine meeting with Trump. European leaders, incensed at being kept in the dark, scrambled to keep Iran from escalating. If it did, Americans developed plans to strike a command-and-control ship and conduct a cyberattack to partly disable Iran’s oil and gas sector.
But the United States also sent secret messages through Swiss intermediaries urging Iran not to respond so forcefully that Trump would feel compelled to go even further. After Iran did respond — firing 16 missiles at bases housing U.S. troops without hurting anyone, as a relatively harmless show of force — a message came back through the Swiss saying that would be the end of its reprisal for now. The message, forwarded to Washington within five minutes after it was received, persuaded the president to stand down.
When the week ended without the war many feared, Trump boasted that he had taken out a U.S. enemy. But the struggle between two nations is not really over. Iran may find other ways to take revenge. Iraqi leaders may expel U.S. forces, accomplishing in death what Soleimani tried and failed to do in life. And in the confusion, a Ukrainian civilian passenger jet was destroyed by an Iranian missile, killing 176 people.
The episode briefly gave Trump’s allies something to cheer, distracting from the coming Senate impeachment trial, but now Trump faces questions even among Republicans about the shifting justifications for the strike that he and his national security team have offered. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo initially cited the need to forestall an “imminent” attack, and the president has amplified that to say four U.S. embassies were targeted.
But administration officials said they did not actually know when or where such an attack might occur, and one State Department official said it was “a mistake” to use the word “imminent.” And some were stunned that Trump picked what they considered a radical option with unforeseen consequences.
This account — based on interviews with dozens of Trump administration officials, military officers, diplomats, intelligence analysts and others in the United States, Europe and the Middle East — offers new details about what may be the most consequential seven days of the Trump presidency.
The confrontation may have actually begun by accident. For years, Iran has sponsored proxy forces in Iraq, competing for influence with U.S. troops who first arrived in the invasion of 2003. Starting last fall, Iranian-backed militias launched rockets at Iraqi bases that house U.S. troops, shattering nerves more than doing much damage.
So when rockets smashed into the K1 military base near Kirkuk on Dec. 27, killing an American civilian contractor, Nawres Waleed Hamid, and injuring several others, the only surprise was the casualties. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia group held responsible, had fired at least five other rocket attacks on bases with Americans in the previous month without deadly results.
U.S. intelligence officials monitoring communications between Hezbollah and Soleimani's Guard learned that the Iranians wanted to keep the pressure on the Americans but had not intended to escalate the low-level conflict. The rockets landed in a place and at a time when U.S. and Iraqi personnel normally were not there, and it was only by unlucky chance that Hamid was killed, U.S. officials said.
But that did not matter to Trump and his team. An American was dead, and the president who had called off a retaliatory strike with 10 minutes to go in June and otherwise refrained from military action in response to Iranian provocations now faced a choice.
Advisers told him Iran had probably misinterpreted his previous reluctance to use force as a sign of weakness. To reestablish deterrence, he should authorize a tough response. On holiday at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, the president agreed to strikes on five sites in Iraq and Syria two days later, killing at least 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah and injuring at least 50 more.
Two days later, on Dec. 31, pro-Iranian protesters backed by many members of the same militia responded by breaking into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad and setting fires. Worried about repeats of the 1979 embassy takeover in Iran or the 2012 attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, Trump and his team ordered more than 100 Marines to rush to Baghdad from Kuwait.
The Marines received little information about their mission or what was happening on the ground as they loaded their magazines with ammunition. All they knew was, they were being sent to secure the embassy with one clear order: If protesters entered the compound, kill them.
Some of the Marines made dry jokes about the movie “Rules of Engagement,” starring Samuel L. Jackson as a commander whose unit fires on a crowd of embassy protesters, stirring an international episode and a court-martial. But when the Marines reached Baghdad, none had to open fire. They used nonlethal weapons like tear gas to disperse protesters, and the siege ended without bloodshed.
Still, watching television in Florida, Trump grew agitated by the chaos and ready to authorize a more robust response. And Dec. 31, even as protests were beginning, a top secret memo began circulating, signed by Robert O’Brien, his national security adviser, listing potential targets, including an Iranian energy facility and a command-and-control ship used by the Guard to direct small boats that harass oil tankers in the waters around Iran. The ship had been an irritant to Americans for months, especially after a series of covert attacks on oil tankers.
The memo also listed a more provocative option: targeting specific Iranian officials for death by military strike. Among the targets mentioned, according to officials who saw it, was Abdul Reza Shahlai, an Iranian commander in Yemen who helped finance armed groups across the region.
Another name on the list: Soleimani.
Soleimani was hardly a household name in the United States, but as far as U.S. officials were concerned, he was responsible for more instability and death in the Middle East than almost anyone.
As head of the elite Quds Force, Soleimani was effectively the second most powerful man in Iran and had a hand in managing proxy wars in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, including a campaign of roadside bombs and other attacks that killed an estimated 600 U.S. troops during the height of the Iraq War.
At 62, with a narrow face, gray hair and a close-cropped beard, Soleimani was known for traveling without body armor or personal protection, collaborating with some of the most ruthless figures in the region while sharing meals with the fighters and telling them to take care of their mothers, according to a Hezbollah field commander who met him in Syria.
After decades of working in the shadows, Soleimani had emerged in recent years following the Arab Spring and war with the Islamic State as the public figure most associated with Iran’s goal of achieving regional dominance. Photographs surfaced showing him visiting the front lines in Iraq or Syria, and meeting with Iran’s supreme leader in Tehran and sitting down with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. When President Bashar Assad of Syria visited Tehran last year, it was Soleimani who welcomed him.
By the end of 2019, Soleimani could boast of a number of Iranian accomplishments: Assad, a longtime Iranian ally, was safely in power in Damascus, Syria’s capital, prevailing in a bloody, multifront, yearslong civil war; and the Quds Force had a permanent presence on Israel’s frontier. A number of militias Soleimani had helped foster were receiving salaries from the Iraqi government and exerting power in Iraq’s political system. And the Islamic State had been defeated in Syria and Iraq — thanks, in part, to ground forces he had overseen, one area where he and the United States shared interests.
For the past 18 months, officials said, there had been discussions about whether to target Soleimani. Figuring that it would be too difficult to hit him in Iran, officials contemplated going after him during one of his frequent visits to Syria or Iraq and focused on developing agents in seven different entities to report on his movements — the Syrian Army, the Quds Force in Damascus, Hezbollah in Damascus, the Damascus and Baghdad airports, and the Hezbollah and Popular Mobilization forces in Iraq.
By the time tensions with Iran spiked in May with attacks on four oil tankers, John Bolton, then the president’s national security adviser, asked the military and intelligence agencies to produce new options to deter Iranian aggression. Among those presented to Bolton was killing Soleimani and other leaders of the Guard. At that point, work to track Soleimani’s travels grew more intense.
By September, the U.S. Central Command and Joint Special Operations Command were brought into the process to plan a possible operation. Various alternatives were discussed — some in Syria, some in Iraq. Syria seemed more complicated, both because the U.S. military had less freedom of movement there and because Soleimani spent most of his time with Hezbollah officers and officials did not want to bring them into the mix and risk a new war with Israel.
Agents recruited in Syria and Iraq reported from time to time on Soleimani’s movements, according to an official involved. Surveillance revealed that he flew on a number of airlines and sometimes tickets for a trip were bought on more than one to throw off pursuers. He would be delivered to his plane at the last possible moment, then sit in the front row of business class so he could get off first and depart quickly.
Soleimani set off on his last trip on New Year’s Day, flying to Damascus and then heading by car to Lebanon to meet with Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, before returning to Damascus that evening. During their meeting, Nasrallah said in a later speech, he warned Soleimani that the U.S. news media was focusing on him and publishing his photograph.
“This was media and political preparation for his assassination,” Nasrallah said.
But as he recalled, Soleimani laughed and said that, in fact, he hoped to die a martyr and asked Nasrallah to pray that he would.
That same day, at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Gina Haspel was working to fulfill that prayer.
Haspel, the director, was shown intelligence indicating that Soleimani was preparing to move from Syria to Iraq. Officials told her there was additional intelligence that he was working on a large-scale attack intended to drive U.S. forces out of the Middle East.
There was no single definitive piece of intelligence. Instead, officials said, CIA officers spoke of the “mosaic effect,” multiple scraps of information that came together indicating that Soleimani was organizing proxy forces around the region, including in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq, to attack U.S. embassies and bases. Several officials said they did not have enough concrete information to describe such a threat as “imminent,” despite Pompeo’s assertion, but they did see a worrying pattern.
While Pompeo also claimed later that such an attack could kill “hundreds,” other officials said they had no specific intelligence suggesting that. Most U.S. facilities in the region have been heavily fortified for years, and such an immense death toll would be unlikely; at no point in the last two decades, even during the worst of the Iraq War, have any hostile forces been able to pull off such a deadly assault on Americans at once.
Nonetheless, Haspel was convinced there was evidence of a coming attack and argued the consequences of not striking Soleimani were more dangerous than waiting, officials said. While others worried about reprisals, she reassured colleagues that Iran’s response would be measured. Indeed, she predicted the most likely response would be an ineffectual missile strike from Iran on Iraqi bases where U.S. troops were stationed.
“If past is prologue, we have learned that when we enforce a red line with Iran, when Iran gets rapped on the knuckles, they tactically retreat,” said Dan Hoffman, a former CIA officer who served in Iraq. “The retreat might be ephemeral before Iran probes its enemies with more gradually escalating attacks, but we’ve seen it repeatedly.”
There was little dissent about killing Soleimani among Trump’s senior advisers, but some Pentagon officials were shocked that the president picked what they considered the most extreme option, and some intelligence officials worried that the possible long-term ramifications were not adequately considered, particularly if action on Iraqi soil prompted Iraq to expel U.S. forces.
“The whole thing seems haphazard to me,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA official who retired last year.
The Trump administration has said that Soleimani was going to Baghdad as part of the attack plot, but there are different theories about the purpose of his visit.
Soleimani had long played a role as power broker in Iraqi politics, and two Iraqi politicians with links to Iran said he was coming to Baghdad to help break an impasse over replacing the prime minister after the collapse of the government in November in the face of anti-Iran protests.
But Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, still serving as a caretaker until a new government is formed, told Parliament after the drone strike that Soleimani had another goal: to bring an Iranian response to a Saudi offer to reduce tensions. The shadow conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia had been heating up. After Iranian forces were blamed for an attack on two Saudi oil facilities in September and Trump opted against a military response, Saudi officials worried that they were vulnerable and opened a back channel.
In his speech to Parliament, Abdul Mahdi said he had planned to meet with Soleimani a few hours after his arrival in Baghdad. “It was expected that he was carrying a message for me from the Iranian side responding to the Saudi message that we had sent to the Iranian side to reach agreements and breakthroughs,” Abdul Mahdi said.
A Saudi official said he was unaware of any message carried by Soleimani, and some analysts doubted Abdul Mahdi’s account. “That is laughable,” said Mohammed Alyahya, editor-in-chief of Al Arabiya English, a Saudi news site. “Suddenly, this man is a diplomat extraordinaire one day before he died?”
Another theory, advanced by an intelligence official involved in the operation, held that Soleimani was visiting Iraq to quash anti-Iranian protests by having his Shiite militia break them up by force. He hoped to install a new anti-U.S. government that might even throw out U.S. forces.
Whatever goals Soleimani may have had, they died with him in the mangled wreckage at Baghdad’s airport. Altogether, 10 people were killed — Soleimani, al-Muhandis and their aides. Al-Muhandis had helped found Hezbollah, the militia held responsible for the Dec. 27 rocket attack that killed the American contractor.
But another Iranian commander escaped. The same night Soleimani died, U.S. forces tried to kill Shahlai, the Quds Force commander in Yemen mentioned in O’Brien’s memo. Still, the attack failed because of an undisclosed problem with the intelligence.
Iran braced for more. “There was a state of mobilization to get ready in case that was the first stage in a wider plan,” said Mohammed Obeid, a Lebanese political activist with ties to Iran’s “resistance axis” in the region. “There could have been other steps that the Americans or the Israelis would take, broadening the circle of confrontation.”
Trump planned to play golf the next morning, Jan. 4, but advisers concluded it would send the wrong message as Soleimani’s death stirred unrest around the Middle East and raised the prospect of a wider conflict with Iran.
The president was initially upbeat, expecting the operation to be greeted with applause much like the raid in October that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State. Indeed, Trump opened his first statement to reporters on the mission that Friday by describing Soleimani as the “No. 1 terrorist anywhere in the world,” much as he had opened his statement a couple of months ago calling al-Baghdadi the “world’s No. 1 terrorist leader.”
But as the president watched television over the weekend, he grew angry that critics were accusing him of reckless escalation. He sought validation from guests at his Florida clubs, recounting details of the Baghdad Embassy protests and drinking in their praise for his decisiveness. He told some associates that he wanted to preserve the support of Republican hawks in the Senate in the coming impeachment trial, naming Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., as an example, even though they had not spoken about Iran since before Christmas.
While Trump tipped off another hawk — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was visiting in Florida — his administration gave no advance warning to its European allies or Persian Gulf partners in advance of the strike. The only foreign leader who appeared in the know was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had spoken with Pompeo before the attack and later offered a cryptic public hint hours before it took place.
“We know that our region is stormy; very, very dramatic things are happening in it,” Netanyahu told reporters, unprompted, on the tarmac in Tel Aviv before departing for a visit to Athens, Greece. He went on to offer support for the United States “and to its full right to defend itself and its citizens.”
Israeli leaders were later pleased by the death of Soleimani, one of their deadliest enemies, but remained silent lest they provoke retaliation, even as shelter supplies were checked and a ski resort near the Syrian frontier was briefly closed.
Yet some figured that if Hezbollah were to attack Israel on Iran’s behalf, it might be better to have that battle now. “This camp believes that there will be such a clash anyway, and the best timing is before the U.S. elections — and that Israel may lose this president in the White House,” said Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.
In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was unsettled. Despite his hawkish approach to Iran, he has been recently accepting offers from Pakistanis, Omanis, Iraqis and others to mediate. Now he immediately dispatched his younger brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the deputy defense minister, on an emergency mission to the White House.
The Saudi view was, “Hitting Soleimani is great, but what is the plan?” said Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador to Riyadh. “If there is a plan, we are down with it. If not, we all have to de-escalate.”
Khalid was pleased by whatever Trump told him, telling diplomats afterward that the royal family was glad the president had dealt Iran a serious blow — and relieved that he did not seem inclined to escalate further.
But many were not sure. Trump issued bellicose threats to destroy Iran if it retaliated, including cultural treasures — in violation of international law — touching off international outrage and forcing his own defense secretary to publicly disavow the threat, saying it would be a war crime.
Trump was largely alone on the world stage. No major European power, not even Britain, voiced support for the drone strike, even as leaders agreed that Soleimani had blood on his hands. As Le Monde, the French newspaper, put it, the rift signaled “a new stage in the trans-Atlantic divorce over the Middle East.”
Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran has been a major point of contention. European leaders deeply resented the unilateral pullout, seeing that as a grave error that started a cycle of sanctions and recriminations that led to the seven-day showdown and now the restart of the Iranian nuclear program.
When Pompeo phoned his European counterparts after the strike, they expressed concern.
In a 15-minute call, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of Germany said the killing had not made it any easier to stabilize the region. Pompeo responded that the situation was now more stable.
The French and Japanese both offered to serve as mediators, but that only annoyed Trump, who dislikes middlemen. So the Europeans focused on keeping Iran from overreacting.
A senior German diplomat sent a text message to his Iranian counterpart urging calm. He got back a terse, though polite, message. In a series of phone calls, European officials tried to give the Iranians a sense that it was not them against the rest of the world but that in fact there was a global public beyond the United States, according to one European diplomat.
President Emmanuel Macron of France played an active role, reaching out to both sides. “Macron’s specificity is that he does not approve, but he also does not condemn,” said Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador to Syria.
Macron reached Trump on Sunday and emphasized the need for de-escalation. Trump suggested he was still open to diplomacy. All the Iranians had to do was come to him, and they could make a deal, Trump said, according to a senior French official.
Two days later, Macron spoke with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and reminded him that he had “missed a chance in September” to talk directly with Trump in a phone call Macron tried to arrange on the sidelines of the annual United Nations session.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke with Trump, too, and expressed concern for Iraq’s stability if allied troops withdrew. If the United States stayed, she said, Germany would also. Trump joked that Germany was welcome to lead the international force and replace the Americans. Merkel laughed.
The most important European country in these seven days, it turned out, was Switzerland, which has served as the intermediary between the United States and Iran since they broke off diplomatic relations in 1980.
Hours after the strike, Markus Leitner, the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, headed to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for the first of two visits that day, according to a Swiss analyst. The Americans had sent a letter to the Iranians through the Swiss warning against any retaliation for the drone strike that would incite further military action by Trump.
The Americans “said that if you want to get revenge, get revenge in proportion to what we did,” Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, deputy commander of the Guard, told Iranian state television.
U.S. officials disputed that characterization, and analysts doubted it was that explicit, although that could be how Iran interpreted it. In any case, Leitner went back to the Foreign Ministry at day’s end for the Iranian response.
Unbeknown to the Iranians, Trump had agreed to targeting the other sites originally considered — the oil and gas facility and the command-in-control ship — as part of any further retaliation that might be necessary if Iran responded to the drone strike. Despite Trump’s threat, none of the targets on the list were actually cultural, an official said; that was just presidential bluster, aggravated by an instinct to double down in the face of criticism.
On Tuesday, the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center, part of the National Security Agency, pulled together multiple strands of information, including overhead imagery and communication intercepts, to conclude that an Iranian missile strike on Iraqi bases was coming, officials said. The center sent the warning to the White House.
Vice President Mike Pence and O’Brien immediately headed to the Situation Room in the basement, joined later by the president and Pompeo. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by its chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, convened in a third-floor conference room and discussed how to move troops and families in the region to safer locations.
Just after 5:30 p.m., an almost robotic voice came over a speakerphone in the Situation Room. “Sir, we have indications of a launch at 22:30 Zulu Time from western Iran in the direction of Iraq, Syria and Jordan.” Reports began coming in faster. The missiles were staggered, but most were streaking toward Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, home to 2,000 U.S. troops.
The barrage ended after an hour, but base commanders ordered troops to remain in shelter in case more missiles came. Around 7:30, about an hour after the strikes concluded, Esper and Milley headed to the White House to meet with Trump.
The missiles damaged a helicopter, some tents and other structures but, thanks to the advance warning, inflicted no casualties. And through the Swiss came another message: That was it. That was Iran’s retribution.
The Americans were struck by the speed of the communication; it was shown to Trump and Pompeo within five minutes after the Swiss received it from Iran. They passed the it by encrypted fax to their embassy in Washington and then to Brian Hook, the special representative on Iran, two minutes after the Iranians gave it to them.
Esper, a veteran of the Persian Gulf War of 1991, counseled caution. “Let’s stay calm,” he said. “The ball is in our court. There’s no rush to do anything. Let’s all sleep on it.”
By the time Trump retired to the residence for the night, advisers said, he was relieved there had been no casualties and eager for a reset, a path away from a deeper conflict. He posted a reassuring tweet: “All is well!”
The next morning Trump addressed the nation from the White House, and while he excoriated Iran’s “campaign of terror,” he made clear he would not retaliate further.
“Iran appears to be standing down,” he said, without revealing the secret message sent through the Swiss, adding that he was “ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.”
The immediate crisis over, Trump sent top officials to brief Congress, but the closed-door sessions in a secure facility where lawmakers had to surrender their telephones did little to quell concerns about the justification for the drone strike.
In the House briefing, Pompeo offered a brief introduction, followed by presentations by Haspel, Esper, Milley and Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence. All three offered vague but emphatic assertions of intelligence indicating an imminent threat by Soleimani. Milley said the evidence could not be clearer and was the “best intelligence” he had seen during his career.
But they refused to describe it in detail. One lawmaker said the information was no more secret than what could be found on Wikipedia. At one point, Milley said the intelligence showed discussion by Soleimani of potential terrorist attacks on three specific dates in late December or early January.
“What were the threats?” several lawmakers in the audience shouted, but Milley declined to say.
Another lawmaker noted that the three dates Milley cited were all before the strike on Soleimani, and no attacks actually occurred then.
“What really came across was a sense of disdain and contempt for the legislative branch,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “They didn’t even pretend to be engaged in information sharing and consultation.”
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the session for senators “probably the worst briefing” in his nine years in office. “We never got to the details,” he said. “Every time we got close, they said, ‘Well, we can’t discuss that here because it’s sensitive.’”
If it was too sensitive for Congress, it was not too sensitive for Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host. In an interview broadcast Friday, Trump told her that the threat had been to four U.S. embassies, even as other officials said privately that they did not have concrete evidence of Soleimani’s targets.
After seven days of saber rattling and fresh deployments, the immediate march to war had ended. But inside the security establishment, few consider the crisis to be over. In the months to come, they expect Iran to regroup and find ways to strike back.
“Soleimani as a person inspired the masses. He was a national icon. He symbolized the struggle,” said Ali Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington who studies Iran. “But he was also a very small part of a very large organization.
“Yes, it is decapitated,” he added, “but the organization is not destroyed.”

306,1907805973.xml,"html>In what her government has called “a sign of solidarity,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Friday.
High on the agenda during her two-day state visit to Mexico will be their mutual political dilemma: President Trump.
From the launch of his presidential campaign two years ago through his early days in the White House, Trump made Mexico his punching bag. He called Mexican immigrants criminals, pledged to tax imports from Mexico and insisted that Mexico would pay for construction of a border wall.
But in recent months, he has extended his ire to a much wider circle of nations, many of which, like Mexico, are longtime U.S. allies.
That includes Germany, which the president has criticized for its trade surplus with the U.S., for resettling large numbers of Syrian migrants and for not spending enough on defense to meet its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Merkel has suggested that Trump’s pugnacious foreign policy, which includes recent criticism of U.S. allies South Korea, Australia and Qatar, as well as the mayor of London for his handling of recent terrorist attacks in Britain, may be fundamentally altering the geopolitical map. Europe “can no longer rely” on its longtime friend the United States, she said at an election rally in Munich, Germany, saying people on the continent must “take our fate into our own hands.”
Merkel appears poised to do that on her visit to Mexico, where she and Peña Nieto will discuss trade and how to move forward on combating climate change after Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.
Germany’s ambassador to Mexico, Viktor Elbling, suggested the visit is in part meant to demonstrate his nation’s leadership on the world stage and define new alliances that aren’t centered on the United States. ""The fact that she is coming to Mexico in this difficult international political climate is a very clear sign of solidarity,” he said in a statement.
In Mexico, where many feel not only afraid of the economic ramifications of Trump’s policies, but also deeply offended by his rhetoric, that support is welcome.
“We need Angela on our side, to tell us that she is with us,” wrote Ivonne Melgar, a columnist at Excelsior newspaper, after a Mexican opposition leader met with Merkel in Germany this year.
Beyond seeking new political partnerships, Mexico is also looking to diversify its markets. Trump’s tenure has demonstrated to many leaders here that Mexico’s economy relies too much on the United States, the destination of more than 80% of Mexico’s exports.
Mexican leaders have traveled around the globe in in recent months in search of new trading partners, and are hoping to significantly broaden an existing trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year. Germany is already Mexico’s biggest European trading partner, with $18 billion in trade between them.
In the days after Trump’s election, economists warned of a recession in Mexico, and the peso’s value plummeted over his promises to “rip up” the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some manufacturers planning new factories here held off over fears that exports to the U.S. might become prohibitively costly.
Shortly after Trump took office, U.S.-Mexico friction worsened over disagreements about who would pay for a border wall he had promised. Peña Nieto canceled a planned visit to Washington after Trump signed an executive order calling for construction of the wall and floated the idea of a 20% border tax.
But since then, neither proposal has materialized.
The Trump administration dramatically scaled back its funding request to Congress for wall construction and has not announced a plan to force Mexico to pay for the project. Trump appears to have abandoned his January call for an import tax on Mexico and other countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. Last month his administration sent official notice to Congress that it plans to renegotiate NAFTA, but the two-page letter promised none of the major modifications Trump had previously vowed.
In Mexico, there is a palpable sense of relief.
“He’s not only focused on Mexico now,” said political analyst Jose Antonio Crespo. “It’s made people here more relaxed.”
“Yes, he’s crazy,” Crespo said of Trump. “But it’s not just directed at us.”
Trump’s focus on other regions of the world, as well as the FBI investigation into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia, has shifted the spotlight away from Mexico. The economy appears to have responded, with the peso regaining so much value on the dollar that it is one of the world's best-performing currencies this year.
“It’s a positive thing for Mexico to not be the top bull’s-eye for the president,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.
Still, many Mexicans are still wary of what may come. They know that Trump could again turn his focus to their country.
“Mexico can become the object of Trump’s attention at any minute,” said Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University's Baker Institute. “It only takes him seeing a new article or a tweet.”

307,1434724300.xml,"       Angela Merkel's conservatives won a major victory in Sunday's  German election, according to official results, putting her in  position to serve a third term as chancellor after negotiations to  form a coalition with the left-wing opposition. The results showed Merkel's Christian Democratic Union at 41.5  percent, leading the main opposition Social Democrats by 17  percentage points.  A new party founded in opposition to the euro, the Alternative for  Germany, received 4.7 percent of the vote, below the 5 percent  threshold needed to enter Parliament. Merkel's current coalition  partners, the Free Democrats, had 4.8 percent. It means the  liberal, pro-business party will drop out of the Bundestag, the  lower house, for the first time in its history.  The Christian Democrats will probably seek a ""grand coalition"" with  the Social Democrats to form a stable government.  ""This is a super result,"" said Merkel, 59, when it became clear she  is on target to serve another four-year term. ""Together, we will do  all we can to make the next four years successful ones for  Germany.""  Projections based on early results showed the Christian Democrats  winning 296 seats in the 598-seat Bundestag, four short of a  majority. The Social Democrats would have 182 seats, and their  allies, the Greens, 60. Die Linke, or the Left, a far-left party  descended from East Germany's Communists, would also have 60.  The Free Democrats had been the kingmaker of German politics since  the first postwar election in 1949. But the party has struggled as  Merkel's junior coalition partner. While the chancellor has claimed  credit for Germany's economic success, little of the Free  Democrats' political program has been enacted.  Christian Lindner, a former general secretary of the party, told  state broadcaster ARD that Sunday's election marked ""the most  bitter hour since 1949"" for his party.  The Christian Democrats' share of the vote was up 8 percentage  points from the 2009 election, but the Free Democrats' plummeted.  Ursula von der Leyen, the Christian Democratic labor minister, told  ARD that the outcome was ""simply fantastic"" for her party.  As its price for joining a coalition, the Social Democrats would be  expected to demand the introduction of a national minimum wage and  an increase in the top rate of taxation. Both policies are opposed  by the Christian Democrats as harmful for job creation.  The Social Democrats may also push for a softer line on the  eurozone crisis, including some means of jointly guaranteeing state  debts across the single currency zone.

308,420433987.xml,"         Germany's two largest political parties sealed an agreement Friday to govern the country together, under Angela Merkel, who would become the country's first female chancellor.    But after six weeks of grueling negotiations, which exposed fissures on both sides and necessitated deep compromises, the new government faced a murky future, shorn of the zeal that many here believed is necessary to boost Germany's stagnant economy and cut unemployment.    ""This can become a coalition of new possibilities,"" Merkel said after the conclusion of talks between her Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of the departing chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.    ""We want to make more of Germany,"" said Merkel, a 51-year-old physicist from the former East Germany who took up politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall.    Merkel has survived a perilous passage to becoming the chancellor- designate since the federal elections on Sept. 19. Her party, which had once been expected to win in a landslide, finished in a virtual tie with the Social Democrats, requiring delicate talks to work out the sharing of power.    Schroeder initially refused to yield to her as chancellor, before relenting last month. Then the negotiations to cobble together a coalition were jeopardized by dissension within the Social Democrats and the defection of one of Merkel's most prominent conservative rivals.    Even now, the two parties must ratify the agreement. If they do sign off, as is generally expected, Merkel would be elected chancellor by parliament Nov. 22.    She would emerge from that vote with half her Cabinet--including the Foreign, Finance and Labor Ministries--in the hands of her former political opponents, the Social Democrats.    Even more important, Merkel has had to set aside many of her proposals for overhauling Germany's economy, including a simpler tax regimen, changes in health care and pensions, and a more flexible labor market. The Social Democrats objected to Merkel's proposals to curb unions and to make it easier to dismiss workers.    Plans to restructure the medical and pension systems were also either watered down or deferred. And the Social Democrats succeeded in nudging up the tax rate for people with high salaries.    The result of all this compromise, critics say, is a coalition agreement that has as its boldest initiative an increase in the value-added tax to 19 percent, from 16 percent. The government would use the extra revenue to plug its vast budget deficit, which is in violation of European Union laws.    ""This really gives no hope to anybody in Germany for political mobilization,"" said Claus Leggewie, a political science professor at Giessen University. ""Germans would like one idea, one phrase, one catchword to encourage them. This is the lowest common denominator.""
